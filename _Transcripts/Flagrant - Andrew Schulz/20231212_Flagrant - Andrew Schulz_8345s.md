# Action Bronson Exposes The Music Industry, Best Pizza In NYC, and Why Drakes The Goat
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [December 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg)
*  I learned how to f*** by dancing reggae. I just want to let you know, like, if you weren't dancing reggae in the rec room in Queens, you don't f*** good. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=0.0s)]
*  Then I got the Chevy Lumina. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8.0s)]
*  Ooh! [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=9.36s)]
*  Mint green. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=10.0s)]
*  And the wheel was like that permanently. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=11.6s)]
*  And then I crashed that within three days. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=13.8s)]
*  I tried to hit somebody in my building. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=16.4s)]
*  Oh, they do. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=18.2s)]
*  I will get to that. He was on it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=19.0s)]
*  I was taking, like, project steroids. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=20.2s)]
*  My boy, Musclehead Ed, was making the trick. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=22.0s)]
*  So he was shooting in your ass? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=24.2s)]
*  Yeah. He'll hurt you. He'll hurt your butt. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=25.6s)]
*  Where is Atma Silver from? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=30.0s)]
*  I don't know, but I'll tell you this. He gives a real good hip-hop handshake. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=31.6s)]
*  Set the tone crazy, like, what up? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=35.2s)]
*  And murder notch. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=38.6s)]
*  No way. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=39.6s)]
*  He said it to me with his eyes. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=42.0s)]
*  This is it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=44.2s)]
*  Chef Dove. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=45.0s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=45.8s)]
*  Did you warm them up? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=46.6s)]
*  This is f***ing silly right here. Hold on. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=47.6s)]
*  You want to know where each are from, or do you want to kind of be a little surprised? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=49.6s)]
*  Let me do it blind. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=52.2s)]
*  What's up, everybody? Hello and welcome. And today we are joined by... [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  Okay, we have hip-hop legends. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  We have food legends. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=61.4s)]
*  Natural wine legend in the making. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=64.0s)]
*  Maybe an olive oil legend one day. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=67.0s)]
*  I think so. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=69.2s)]
*  Damn, bro. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=69.6s)]
*  Damn, bro. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=70.39999999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of stuff. I'm not even a f***ing... [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=71.2s)]
*  We got Mr. Sway 56 in the building. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=73.2s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=75.6s)]
*  Oh, shit, yo. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=76.6s)]
*  You know about my AOL.com name? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=78.2s)]
*  Ace Sway 56. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=81.4s)]
*  You got Mel. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=84.2s)]
*  Rotten.com. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=86.0s)]
*  Come on, man. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=87.0s)]
*  What's good, man? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=87.8s)]
*  How you guys doing, man? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=88.6s)]
*  I'm good, man. It's been too long, bro. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=89.6s)]
*  I hollered at your boy Clovis. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=91.2s)]
*  What did you say? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=93.2s)]
*  I was just like, yo, man, we need a good natural wine for the pie. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=94.6s)]
*  We need something nice to sip on. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=97.2s)]
*  So he gave me two selections. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=99.0s)]
*  Maybe we go sip on a little bit later. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=100.39999999999999s)]
*  But we had to go deep cut research, bro. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=102.8s)]
*  I mean, if you're hitting him up, I'm guaranteed it's going to be phenomenal. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=105.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=107.8s)]
*  I guarantee... I'm going to... [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=108.6s)]
*  I can't guarantee other things about him. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=111.0s)]
*  But his selection of natural wine is f***ing 100%. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=113.6s)]
*  What's the other shit you can't guarantee? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=116.6s)]
*  He's just, you know, he's one of those f***ing Frenchmen. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  He's just like, you know, he's unpredictable. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=120.8s)]
*  He's unpredictable, but he's charming. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=123.0s)]
*  Yeah, he is. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  He's a beautiful guy. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=125.8s)]
*  Bro, I'm stoked that you're here. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=126.8s)]
*  I've been following your life for a while. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=129.2s)]
*  And there's one like through line that I've loved with your professional career. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=132.2s)]
*  Is it feels like from the outside, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=137.6s)]
*  there's nothing that you will be motivated to do [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=141.0s)]
*  that you don't love? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=145.2s)]
*  Psh. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  I really appreciate that. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=148.2s)]
*  That exudes me. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=151.0s)]
*  It exudes out of me. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  That's the f***ing exact thing. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=153.39999999999998s)]
*  I can't... [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=155.39999999999998s)]
*  I just don't have it in me. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=156.39999999999998s)]
*  I'm not... [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=157.6s)]
*  Like, I've been through it for a minute now. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=159.0s)]
*  It's been 14 years since I started doing music. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  And you learn quick [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=163.0s)]
*  that when you're dealing with some certain situations that you're not made for, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=165.79999999999998s)]
*  I'm not going to f***ing... [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=170.39999999999998s)]
*  I don't respond well to that type of thing. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=171.79999999999998s)]
*  Like what? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=173.79999999999998s)]
*  Just like, you know, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=174.6s)]
*  being coaxed into trying to do certain things, certain ways. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  It's just not my thing. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=179.4s)]
*  I have to f*** up. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=181.2s)]
*  I have to do it my way. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=182.2s)]
*  I have to, you know, figure it out. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=183.2s)]
*  Trial and error. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=185.4s)]
*  On my way. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=186.4s)]
*  Yeah, it needs to be your way. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=187.2s)]
*  It has to be. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=188.6s)]
*  There's no other way. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=189.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=190.2s)]
*  I'm a f***ing control freak. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=192.6s)]
*  Agreed. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=193.6s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=194.2s)]
*  100%. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=194.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=195.2s)]
*  You got to have the vision. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=196.2s)]
*  You know what you want. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=197.2s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=198.2s)]
*  No one else knows what I want. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, that's the thing I think when some people don't understand this. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=200.2s)]
*  Some people just want success. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=203.0s)]
*  They don't care about the art or the passion. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=205.2s)]
*  So for them, they're like, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=207.8s)]
*  well, tell me what to do to be successful. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=209.0s)]
*  Like, I'll do whatever you tell me as long as it leads me to success. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=211.2s)]
*  But if you're doing something because you're passionate about it, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=215.0s)]
*  which I've seen with you and I'll bring up an instant that made me think about it, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=218.2s)]
*  but it's like, if you're doing something you're passionate about [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=221.8s)]
*  and then someone tells you to do it in a different way, you're like, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=224.4s)]
*  but that's not what I want to do. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=227.0s)]
*  And they're like, this will make you more money. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=229.2s)]
*  And you're like, I don't think you're understanding. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=230.6s)]
*  Like, I'm doing this because I love this. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=232.6s)]
*  And then if people fuck with it, that's a bonus. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=235.4s)]
*  100%. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=238.2s)]
*  You have to go into it looking like that because I'm not a fucking puppet. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=239.6s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=243.0s)]
*  I'm the puppeteer. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=243.6s)]
*  I'm the puppet master. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=245.6s)]
*  I'm the one pulling the fucking string. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=247.79999999999998s)]
*  I'm making the guy do this and I know all the dances. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=250.2s)]
*  I'm doing that. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=253.0s)]
*  So what happened when they first tried to make you dance? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=253.6s)]
*  Well, I don't think they ever tried to really make me dance [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=256.0s)]
*  because they knew I wasn't going to dance. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=258.4s)]
*  And that's why I became independent quite quickly. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=260.6s)]
*  So, I mean, for the most part, everyone thinks that they know what they could do with you. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=265.6s)]
*  They try and pinpoint who you fucking are and what they think you do. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=271.20000000000005s)]
*  But there's no pinpoint. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=276.40000000000003s)]
*  I have new aspirations and new things that I like daily. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=277.40000000000003s)]
*  Before I came here, I was just cooking. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=281.8s)]

*  Thank you. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=317.59999999999997s)]
*  It's one of those things where it's like, I've seen this with comedy. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=318.0s)]
*  Sometimes you see it with music. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=320.8s)]
*  Sometimes you see it when people are like giving speeches, like a really good order [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=321.8s)]
*  can get people to kind of like fall into the vortex where I was texting. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=325.8s)]
*  And then I was watching some of the food videos and bro, you react to food the same way you [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=329.2s)]
*  react to music. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=338.0s)]
*  Did you realize it? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=339.6s)]
*  You were like moaning a little bit. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=341.4s)]
*  You're like looking up at the air. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=343.4s)]
*  You're like, oh my god. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=344.8s)]
*  It's because it's all pleasure. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=345.6s)]
*  Like no matter what it is, it could be music, art, this, that, a woman's touch, whoever's [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=347.0s)]
*  touch, if you feel that chicken skin, that tingle, that's a real fucking feeling. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=353.20000000000005s)]
*  Like just talking about it, I'm overcome. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=359.6s)]
*  Just talking about that shit. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=364.20000000000005s)]
*  Just talking about certain situations. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=365.6s)]
*  It's anything like watching someone win, like come back from a fight. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=367.20000000000005s)]
*  I cry at like weird sports stories. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=374.0s)]
*  You know, you still, you're so like. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=377.2s)]

*  Exactly. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=380.8s)]
*  Like I'm sterilized by watching death on Twitter. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=381.4s)]
*  I see it all day long. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=385.6s)]

*  It looks like a fucking movie all the time, but it's real. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=388.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, that doesn't make me cry. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=390.0s)]
*  A story about the fucking guy coming back to the dog that hasn't seen him in 20 years. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=394.0s)]
*  The dog jumps all over him. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=399.8s)]

*  Hell yeah. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=412.2s)]
*  The way you taste food, the things you say when you're tasting coffee and you say I taste [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=413.2s)]
*  purple, when you have Christie's pizza and you say I taste, this is summer. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=417.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=421.8s)]
*  Can you explain that to me? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=422.6s)]
*  Because I don't be tasting that. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=423.6s)]
*  Indian food too spicy to eat. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=426.40000000000003s)]
*  Spicy. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=429.40000000000003s)]
*  These are things I understand. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=430.40000000000003s)]
*  I speak with Indian food with more passion than I don't know about it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=432.40000000000003s)]
*  Anyone that I know, it's like I just have a passion for flavor and zest and fire. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=437.40000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=443.40000000000003s)]
*  Which all Indian food has. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=444.40000000000003s)]
*  And I think that I just have a lot of things. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=445.40000000000003s)]
*  I've lived a lot of life. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=450.40000000000003s)]
*  I haven't just been here for 40 years existing. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=451.40000000000003s)]
*  I've been fucking doing shit. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=455.4s)]
*  I'm in the streets. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=456.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=457.59999999999997s)]
*  I'm out. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=458.59999999999997s)]
*  I've been all kinds of places around this world on earth, whoever, elsewhere as well. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=459.59999999999997s)]
*  So I have a lot of comparisons to draw upon. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=465.59999999999997s)]
*  Colors, fucking this, anything you could think of. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=468.59999999999997s)]
*  Sometimes you see a color. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=471.59999999999997s)]
*  Sometimes you smell permanent marker. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=473.59999999999997s)]
*  Sometimes you see an 87 635 CSI all white dropped on Borbet rims. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=475.59999999999997s)]
*  It could be whatever. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=482.59999999999997s)]
*  And I could be thinking, I could be talking about fish or I could be talking about a marshmallow. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=484.8s)]
*  Is food art to you? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=489.8s)]
*  Because you'll talk about music the same way. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=490.8s)]
*  Food is art. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=492.8s)]
*  So that's called culinary arts. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=493.8s)]
*  You know, it's not just, it's the art of making food presentably gorgeous and delicious. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=494.8s)]
*  But evoking emotion through the food. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=500.8s)]
*  It is. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=502.8s)]
*  It's theater. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=503.8s)]
*  I've been taught. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=504.8s)]
*  You could go to restaurants. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=505.8s)]
*  You could go to watch a play. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=506.8s)]
*  You could go to Les Miserables. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=508.8s)]
*  Or you could go to, I don't know, like a beautiful restaurant and have the same sort of experience, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=511.0s)]
*  the same theatrical. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=517.0s)]
*  Theater. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=518.0s)]
*  It's theater. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=519.0s)]
*  Everything is theater. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=520.0s)]
*  Yeah, it taps into some shit you've already felt. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=521.0s)]
*  There's a friend of ours, his uncle's in the biz and he would, he would like advise, I [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=524.0s)]
*  guess, or consult on a bunch of these restaurants. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=530.0s)]
*  And he'd like, you know, try these desserts. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=532.0s)]
*  He's like, this is delicious, but it's not fall. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=533.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=536.0s)]
*  I'm like, what does that mean? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=537.0s)]
*  And he goes, it doesn't evoke the feelings that you had in Thanksgiving when you were [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=538.2s)]
*  a kid. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=543.6s)]
*  For sure. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=544.6s)]
*  Like you gotta bite in and then think about your childhood. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=545.6s)]
*  Like on some ratatouille shit. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=547.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=548.8s)]
*  If that's what you're going for, I mean, you're not gonna serve a passion fruit tart in the [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=549.8s)]
*  dead of winter. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=553.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=554.08s)]
*  That doesn't evoke Caribbean unless you're trying to take someone away from where they [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=555.08s)]
*  are presently. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=559.28s)]
*  You want a vacation. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=560.28s)]
*  You come here for it. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=561.28s)]
*  You know, you wanna put that vacation in your mouth. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=562.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=563.28s)]
*  And there it is. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=564.28s)]
*  What about women? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=565.28s)]
*  Was it like this with women? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=566.28s)]
*  I learned how to cook to try and coax a woman. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=568.1199999999999s)]
*  Really? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=570.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, yeah, you know, you want to be able to impress, you know, a shy guy. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=571.3199999999999s)]
*  A shy guy. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=575.3199999999999s)]
*  Wait, who is this girl? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=578.3199999999999s)]
*  I learned how to fuck by dancing reggae. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=581.3199999999999s)]
*  I just want to let you know, like, if you weren't dancing reggae in the rec room in Queens, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=584.3199999999999s)]
*  you don't fuck good. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=589.5999999999999s)]
*  Really? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=590.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's a fact. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=591.5999999999999s)]
*  Like dagger and everything? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=592.5999999999999s)]
*  That's a fact. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=593.5999999999999s)]
*  There was no daggering at that. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=594.5999999999999s)]
*  It was just like lots of grinding in the butterfly. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=595.64s)]
*  The butterfly was a big move. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=597.88s)]
*  Who was the first guy to start to dagger? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=598.88s)]
*  Like that guy was brave or crazy. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=601.0400000000001s)]
*  Man, I've seen some extreme daggering off the roof of buildings. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=603.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=607.76s)]
*  There's like extreme daggering competitions. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=608.76s)]
*  From the turnbuckle. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=611.76s)]
*  Full-on spin-offs. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=614.76s)]
*  It's wrestling, bro. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=615.76s)]
*  Like 20 foot on top of a building. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=616.76s)]
*  Like, yo, somehow power slamming this woman and they land and they're still dancing. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=617.76s)]
*  They still dance. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=622.76s)]
*  They landed. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=623.76s)]
*  They're still dancing. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=624.92s)]
*  He's fucking crazy. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=625.92s)]
*  So what was the first meal that you cooked that girl? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=628.2s)]
*  Some bullshit ass pasta dish. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=631.52s)]
*  Yeah, it was some trash, but it was all right. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=633.3199999999999s)]
*  But would your dad do this for your mom? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=636.12s)]
*  Like, where does this come from? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=637.6s)]
*  No, hell no. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=638.6s)]
*  I just learned from my grandparents. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=639.6s)]
*  My grandmother was the best cook around. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=641.72s)]
*  You know, the best Albanian. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=644.0s)]
*  You know, when you're Albanian, you go to different people's houses and everyone gives [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=645.0s)]
*  you the food. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=649.54s)]
*  You weren't turning down my grandmother's food. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=652.54s)]
*  I would turn cigarettes and food down constantly when I was a child. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=655.2s)]
*  Now, anything goes. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=658.2s)]
*  The Albanians in New York, were you really plugged in growing up? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=662.2s)]
*  What does that even mean? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=669.32s)]
*  Okay, is it true the Albanians took over? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=670.32s)]
*  No, no, no, not like that. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=673.32s)]
*  But when I was texting you, I was asking, because do you remember the, you might be [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=676.32s)]
*  young for this, but there were these Albanian gangs? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=680.44s)]
*  No, I remember. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=682.6s)]
*  The FBI, where there was the Albanian boys or something like that. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=683.72s)]
*  Do you remember? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=686.84s)]
*  It sounds original, the Albanian boys? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=687.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=689.84s)]
*  I mean, listen, they were just learning English, you know? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=690.84s)]
*  This is like, this was uptown. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=693.84s)]
*  This is maybe like uptown in Queens. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=695.84s)]
*  I know about the Queens ones, but I've heard about the sons of doorman and the sons of [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=699.12s)]
*  — [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=704.32s)]
*  Famiglia pizza owners. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=705.32s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=706.32s)]
*  Those guys, but the sons of doorman and the sons of the workers of the building, like [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=707.32s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=713.12s)]
*  They would terrorize the east side and the west side of the city. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=714.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=716.64s)]
*  There's stories of all kinds of Albanian brothers and all kinds. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=717.64s)]
*  I mean, it's never a story like, man, this guy's a tremendous surgeon. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=721.28s)]
*  Like we know this Albanian guy shakes fucking one of the top elbow surgeons on earth. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=725.24s)]
*  No, never hear that bullshit. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=734.0s)]
*  Yeah, you guys were getting after it. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=736.08s)]
*  Yeah, but Albanians, I'm like, do you speak Albanian? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=738.08s)]
*  A little bit. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=742.8000000000001s)]
*  I understand much more than I speak. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=743.8000000000001s)]
*  When I was younger, I did, but now it's really not many — [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=744.8000000000001s)]
*  Nobody you speak. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=747.0s)]
*  — I want to talk to. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=748.0s)]
*  I speak Spanish. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=749.0s)]
*  Yeah, because that's who I'm — [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=750.0s)]
*  Not only that, but my wife's Colombian, that's who I'm talking to all day long. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=751.0s)]
*  Any interest in learning Albanian? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=755.44s)]
*  I feel like I need to. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=757.64s)]
*  I'm embarrassed to tell you I don't speak it, honestly. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=758.9200000000001s)]
*  My name is not good enough. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=761.0s)]
*  You just got to go there, I think. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=762.0s)]
*  I've been there fucking three, four times. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=763.0s)]
*  We have to stay there for an elongated period of time, and you have to practice constantly. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=765.36s)]
*  It's one of the hardest dialects to learn because it's not directly correlated from anything. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=770.72s)]
*  Any language. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=774.72s)]
*  It's its own fucking language, literally. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=775.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=778.72s)]
*  I think a lot of people don't realize how unique Albania is even within the Balkans. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=779.72s)]
*  I mean, my family's from Kosovo and from Skopje. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=783.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=787.72s)]
*  So, former Yugoslavia. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=788.72s)]
*  So you're ethnically Albanian in Kosovo. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=790.92s)]
*  So Kosovo gets independence, but within Kosovo, most people are ethnically Albanian, even [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=796.0s)]
*  though it was part of Yugoslavia. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=802.4s)]
*  Ethnically Muslim Albanian. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=803.88s)]
*  Muslim Albanian. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=805.4s)]
*  And Islam comes in with the Ottomans in that region. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=806.54s)]
*  You know what? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=808.88s)]
*  I'm not a historian, but I would imagine sometime around then. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=809.88s)]
*  When the goats came. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=816.76s)]
*  I heard when you went out there and did a show, it was kind of insane. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=826.2s)]
*  It was like Zlaty Dvoz wedding shit. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=830.0s)]
*  It was like 10,000 people smoking cigarettes. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=832.28s)]
*  Crazy or what? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=837.28s)]
*  It was pandemonium. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=838.28s)]
*  I mean, Dua Lipa brought me out there for God's sakes. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=839.28s)]
*  It was her festival, and we're both from there. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=842.2s)]
*  I was chilling with my uncles and my cousins. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=847.5600000000001s)]
*  My uncles and cousins were at the festival, and they couldn't even fucking understand what [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=850.5400000000001s)]
*  was happening. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=854.5600000000001s)]
*  They didn't understand. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=856.1199999999999s)]
*  They really didn't get it. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=857.1199999999999s)]
*  So they just knew you as a relative, but they didn't know it was like that. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=859.04s)]
*  They're such simple people. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=863.56s)]
*  No one could fathom what had happened. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=866.0s)]
*  No one understands. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=869.2399999999999s)]
*  It's really a fucking crazy story. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=870.7199999999999s)]
*  Was it like make you cry type of shit? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=872.2399999999999s)]
*  They cried. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=874.8s)]
*  I didn't fucking cry. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=875.8s)]
*  Really? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=876.8s)]

*  I know what's up. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=878.8s)]
*  I do it. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=879.8s)]
*  I cried before. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=880.8s)]
*  I'm done crying. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=881.8s)]
*  I cried. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=882.8s)]
*  I cried all these tears out. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=884.8s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't know what makes you cry, bro. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=886.8s)]
*  Dog videos? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=889.8s)]
*  Not being treated nicely. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=890.8s)]

*  someone was on the road, there was basically like one venue where you could do the show. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1027.8s)]
*  And that venue might have been owned by like the local drug dealer or whatever. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1031.8s)]
*  The show was like promoted by that. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1035.8s)]
*  By the time you're in the game, are you playing like traditional venues like Live Nation, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1037.8s)]

*  But that's what I'm trying to understand. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1147.8s)]
*  I come from a world of the culinary world where I'm a half hour early. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1148.8s)]

*  Anchorage, you fly into Anchorage and then we did this nature thing. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1203.8s)]
*  We took some fucking, went fly fishing in the middle of who the fuck knows where. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1206.8s)]
*  Do you know maybe? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1210.8s)]
*  No, it was like the Arctic Circle area. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1211.8s)]
*  You had to fly the water boat and land in the goddamn valley of ice. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1213.8s)]
*  Wow. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1219.8s)]
*  And I got fucking sick playing NBA Jam and I had to fucking get surgery out there so [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1220.8s)]
*  I didn't even get to do that. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1225.8s)]
*  You got surgery in the middle of Alaska? [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1226.8s)]
*  Yo, they got the best goddamn surgeons out there. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1227.8s)]
*  They pay them so much. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1230.8s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1231.8s)]
*  Because you get hurt out there, you know? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1232.8s)]
*  And nobody wants to go live there. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1234.8s)]
*  If you're a doctor, you're like fuck this. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1235.8s)]

*  How'd you get hurt playing NBA Jam? [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1238.8s)]
*  That's what I'm trying to think. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1239.8s)]
*  I had a hernia prior and it just fucking seized up. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1240.8s)]
*  But it was because I was doing mad moves. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1242.8s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1245.8s)]

*  Exactly. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1249.8s)]
*  And I fucking ended up having to get emergency surgery. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1250.8s)]
*  A hernia from NBA Jam is crazy. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1252.8s)]
*  It was a prior. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1254.8s)]
*  It just inflamed it. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1255.8s)]
*  I was on fire in there. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1256.8s)]

*  No, when you switch it up. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1273.8s)]
*  Listen, certain plays, you know, there's certain teams you have to switch it up. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1275.8s)]
*  You don't always use fucking Starks, Ewing or Starks, Oakley. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1279.8s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1282.8s)]
*  It depends on the matchup. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1283.8s)]
*  You never use Charles Smith. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1284.8s)]
*  No, I never. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1285.8s)]
*  I can't believe we used him. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1286.8s)]
*  Do you guys know that? [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1287.8s)]
*  The Charles Smith Memorial. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1288.8s)]
*  This is, yeah. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1289.8s)]
*  Underneath the rim. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1290.8s)]
*  RIP. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1291.8s)]
*  What is that? [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1292.8s)]
*  I've never heard of this. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1293.8s)]
*  The Charles Smith Memorial. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1294.8s)]
*  Fuck it, when he missed 47 layups in a row. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1295.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1296.8s)]
*  In the playoffs. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1297.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1298.8s)]
*  I've never heard of this. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1299.8s)]
*  This is a heartbreaking moment. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1300.8s)]
*  I can't believe we're bringing this up right now. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1301.8s)]
*  It's all right, fuck it. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1302.8s)]
*  Let's move on. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1303.8s)]
*  Are you really anti-Jordan still? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1304.8s)]
*  Is that real? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1305.8s)]
*  I don't fuck with Jordan at all. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1306.8s)]
*  Yeah, why is this? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1307.8s)]
*  I just, I don't know. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1308.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1309.8s)]
*  First of all, I'm a New York guy, Knicks fan. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1311.8s)]
*  Fucking, I hate Michael Jordan sneakers. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1316.8s)]
*  Because it's like, for me, it's like, I don't know. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1319.8s)]
*  It's like the type of uniform. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1322.8s)]
*  It's like you're a fucking, I don't even know. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1324.8s)]
*  It's a robot. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1326.8s)]
*  And he was a fucking asshole when I met him. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1328.8s)]
*  What did he say? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1330.8s)]
*  No, he just gave you a fucking weird handshake. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1331.8s)]
*  Like a walk-by handshake. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1333.8s)]
*  It was whatever. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1336.8s)]
*  I was with Oakley. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1339.8s)]
*  I was like, yo, fucking, oh, fuck this guy. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1340.8s)]
*  Oakley had on the gecko belt. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1342.8s)]
*  You know about Oakley's studded gecko belt? [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1344.8s)]
*  No, what is this? [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1347.8s)]
*  Legendary, man. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1348.8s)]
*  He has like this, he wears a lot of wide-leg pants. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1349.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1352.8s)]
*  So he likes to wear the studded belts. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1353.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1355.8s)]
*  And he has a gecko like that. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1356.8s)]
*  It's a fucking sick one. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1357.8s)]
*  What's Oakley like? [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1359.8s)]
*  He's cool. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1361.8s)]
*  He's chill. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1362.8s)]
*  He cooks. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1363.8s)]
*  Really? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1364.8s)]
*  He had a cooking show. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1365.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1366.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1367.8s)]
*  And? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1368.8s)]
*  Cook? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1369.8s)]
*  Huh? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1370.8s)]
*  Good cook? [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1371.8s)]
*  There you go. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1372.8s)]
*  Moderate. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1373.8s)]
*  You better watch out. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1374.8s)]
*  And I feel like you'd be nice if I'm being honest. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1375.8s)]
*  I love Oakley. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1377.8s)]
*  That's one of my guys. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1378.8s)]
*  You didn't say you love his food, though. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1379.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1382.8s)]
*  I never tasted it, to be honest. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1383.8s)]
*  You saw it from the eye. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1384.8s)]
*  I'm going to save the calories. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1385.8s)]
*  I did the eye test. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1386.8s)]
*  You know, whether you think that's going to be good, you know, I don't know. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1387.8s)]
*  This tastes like winter. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1391.8s)]
*  Yeah, this tastes like rubber shoe. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1392.8s)]
*  It's all right. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1397.8s)]
*  He don't need to be a good cook. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1399.8s)]
*  He was a good rebounder and shooter from the top of the key. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1400.8s)]
*  But right on the side of the key. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1403.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that baseline. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1405.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1406.8s)]
*  Yeah, 12 footer on the baseline. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1407.8s)]
*  We're good. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1408.8s)]
*  That's where I'm good from. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1409.8s)]
*  My short game and my in-between game is unmatched. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1410.8s)]
*  Are you moving? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1413.8s)]
*  I'm a real ball. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1414.8s)]
*  Yeah, come on. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1415.8s)]
*  It's the first game you play. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1416.8s)]
*  I mean, here in New York, of course, but I thought you were like a football guy. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1418.8s)]
*  I do it all. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1421.8s)]
*  How do you play football growing up in the city? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1422.8s)]
*  That's another, like, your school. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1424.8s)]
*  Bayside High School. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1425.8s)]
*  You went to like a real. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1426.8s)]
*  I went to Bayside High School. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1427.8s)]
*  Like a big high school, yeah. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1428.8s)]
*  Well, it wasn't really a big high school. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1429.8s)]
*  It's just one of those high schools that had the team. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1430.8s)]
*  Like, I could have went to Jamaica High School, but they don't have no football team. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1432.8s)]
*  Forest Hills High School didn't have a football team. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1436.8s)]
*  I played baseball at Bayside and played football. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1439.8s)]
*  What did you play at Flint football? [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1441.8s)]
*  Center and nose guard. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1443.8s)]
*  So, literally both fat positions. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1445.8s)]
*  Fat guy here, fat guy here. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1450.8s)]
*  I played both of those. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1452.8s)]
*  Center is the smartest position, though, they say. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1453.8s)]
*  Oh, you know, come on, what are we talking about? [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1454.8s)]
*  They used to always bust our ass. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1456.8s)]
*  I played for Channel. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1457.8s)]
*  You played for the. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1458.8s)]
*  I played you. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1459.8s)]
*  Yeah, I used to bust our ass every time. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1460.8s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1462.8s)]
*  You played for Beach Channel, then we played. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1463.8s)]
*  How old are you? [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1464.8s)]
*  34. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1465.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1466.8s)]
*  But I played Beach Channel and it was like fucking crack needles. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1468.8s)]
*  You can't even do crack with a needle. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1471.8s)]
*  But somehow there was crack needles on. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1474.8s)]
*  It wasn't the players shooting up. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1476.8s)]
*  It was the cheerleaders. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1477.8s)]
*  Nah, it was the cheerleaders. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1478.8s)]
*  But there was divots out of the ground, bro. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1479.8s)]
*  Like it was one of the fucking worst fields to play. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1481.8s)]
*  Shouts to fucking great channel Rockaway Queens. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1483.8s)]
*  See respect. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1487.8s)]
*  They were on our schedule every year. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1488.8s)]
*  Beach Channel. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1492.8s)]
*  We were easy dove or what? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1493.8s)]
*  Yeah, when we were playing, yeah, it was when we were playing. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1495.8s)]
*  It was wasn't their fault. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1498.8s)]
*  I only did a couple of years in Beach Channel. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1500.8s)]
*  That's true. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1503.8s)]
*  Then he had to. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1504.8s)]
*  Oh, he was out. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1506.8s)]
*  I got the hell out of that quick also. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1507.8s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1509.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1510.8s)]
*  Wait, did you GED or did you graduate? [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1511.8s)]
*  Nah, GED, but I feel like I have something better than that. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1512.8s)]
*  I got a better one than that. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1515.8s)]
*  Which is? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1516.8s)]
*  Whatever, the better one. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1517.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1518.8s)]
*  I got a hundred on the GED so they gave me the real thing. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1519.8s)]
*  Yeah, I walked into GED school, South Jamaica Queens. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1524.8s)]
*  It's called Flowers with Care. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1530.8s)]
*  No, it was a program called Flowers with Care. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1532.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1535.8s)]
*  That's where I got my GED. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1536.8s)]
*  I walked in and the lady was like, what the fuck are you doing here? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1537.8s)]
*  Just come back when the test is there. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1539.8s)]
*  So I waited two months, came back, got a hundred on the test. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1540.8s)]
*  So they gave me the good diploma. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1545.8s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1547.8s)]
*  Really? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1548.8s)]
*  So you got an official high school diploma. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1549.8s)]
*  Without having to go to all four years. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1551.8s)]
*  I went to two, smoked a lot of weed, drove around in Honda Accords. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1553.8s)]
*  Who's car? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1559.8s)]
*  Some fucking one of the homies who at the time he was selling nickel bags and tray bags of regular weed. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1560.8s)]
*  I had the 96 Jetta VR6 Maroon. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1568.8s)]
*  This is your parents' car? [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1574.8s)]
*  No, that's me. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1575.8s)]
*  When were you stealing your parents' car? [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1576.8s)]
*  I stole my mother's car at 14. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1578.8s)]
*  At 14 you started stealing your mother's car? [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1580.8s)]
*  I crashed the Jeep Grand Cherokee on the L train. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1582.8s)]
*  On the L train? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1586.8s)]
*  Yeah, but not like over in Williamsburg, like fucking Canarsie because we went to go do graffiti and I parked on the side. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1588.8s)]
*  So I'm 14 and I fucking crashed on Atlantic Avenue on the way home. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1594.8s)]
*  No. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1599.8s)]
*  Just kept it moving. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1600.8s)]
*  It didn't run? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1602.8s)]
*  It was already a dent in the car so she didn't really notice. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1604.8s)]
*  She didn't notice? [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1607.8s)]
*  Nah. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1608.8s)]
*  To this day, man, I want the 94 Forest Green Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1609.8s)]
*  I think I'm going to buy that tomorrow. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1616.8s)]
*  Yeah, with the roof rack. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1618.8s)]
*  Of course. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1621.8s)]
*  Of course. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1622.8s)]
*  Where else are you going to put the sofa? [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1623.8s)]
*  And the mattress. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1625.8s)]
*  Okay, and then your girl steals your car and drives it into a Burger King? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1627.8s)]
*  Is this a food story? [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1632.8s)]
*  Oh my God, there's been so many different things. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1634.8s)]
*  First off, the night before Brett Favre makes his fucking debut for the Jets. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1637.8s)]
*  The penal debut. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1644.8s)]
*  I don't know if it was the penal debut, but I believe it was the debut of his arm. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1646.8s)]
*  Of his arm. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1650.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1651.8s)]
*  It wasn't the penile. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1652.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1653.8s)]

*  Set for life, scratch off while I was in underwear. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1674.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1677.8s)]

*  it off. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1682.8s)]
*  Two vanilla duchies and a Snapple lemon ice tea. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1683.8s)]
*  I go outside, the fucking car is gone. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1687.8s)]
*  There were two kids sitting in front of the store. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1690.8s)]
*  I didn't even realize, I didn't even think about it. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1692.8s)]
*  They just jumped in the car when I was fucking scratching off. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1694.8s)]

*  Oh, the Tucson. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1705.8s)]
*  What year did Favre make the debut? [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1706.8s)]
*  2006. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1707.8s)]
*  That's how I remember. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1708.8s)]
*  It was brand new? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1709.8s)]
*  2007. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1710.8s)]
*  Brand new, dog. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1711.8s)]
*  Wow. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1712.8s)]
*  But you know, it was like $12,000 brand new. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1713.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1714.8s)]
*  It's like some piece of shit. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1715.8s)]
*  Thank God they stole it. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1716.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1717.8s)]
*  Because then I got the Chevy Lumina. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1718.8s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1721.8s)]
*  Mint green. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1722.8s)]
*  And the wheel was like that permanently. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1723.8s)]
*  It wasn't centered, it was to the side. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1726.8s)]
*  So you had to like turn. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1728.8s)]
*  You never saw the car. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1730.8s)]
*  And then I crashed that within three days. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1732.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1734.8s)]
*  And then I tried to hit somebody in my building and I fucking backed him. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1735.8s)]
*  Wait, why would they do that? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1738.8s)]
*  What would they do? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1739.8s)]
*  I will get to that. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1740.8s)]
*  He was standing right in front of a tree and I hit the reverse and I fucking floored it [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1741.8s)]
*  and I crashed into the tree. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1747.8s)]
*  And then the whole fucking muffler system got stuck in the tree. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1750.8s)]
*  Damn. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1754.8s)]
*  Now, can you tell us what he did to prompt you to crash the car into him? [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1755.8s)]
*  He pulled a knife on me in my building. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1759.8s)]
*  Inside the building you both live in? [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1761.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1763.8s)]
*  And then he came to me. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1764.8s)]
*  I was going to the fucking, going to work. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1765.8s)]
*  And it was early in the morning. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1767.8s)]
*  I think he'd come home from some sort of like serious situation in the evening of doing [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1769.8s)]
*  an all-nighter. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1774.8s)]
*  And he just looked crazy, pulled a knife on me. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1775.8s)]
*  And then we walked out. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1779.8s)]
*  Somehow we just walked away. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1780.8s)]
*  And then I saw him walk out of the building and I wife-howed him. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1782.8s)]
*  And I fucking predatorized him. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1786.8s)]
*  And I tried to, I don't know what I was going to do. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1788.8s)]
*  I was trying to hit him with a vehicle. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1790.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1792.8s)]
*  And I missed. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1793.8s)]
*  And then he tried to stab me through the window. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1797.8s)]
*  I jumped out of the window. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1799.8s)]
*  I fucking caught him. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1800.8s)]
*  I earth slammed him. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1801.8s)]
*  And I mounted him and pounded his face until the cops came and no one got arrested. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1802.8s)]
*  No one. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1806.8s)]
*  Wow. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1807.8s)]
*  I just asked them to make a circle so we could finish it. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1808.8s)]
*  They wanted. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1814.8s)]
*  They wanted. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1815.8s)]
*  How old are you at this time? [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1816.8s)]
*  22, 23. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1820.8s)]
*  What's the wildest shit you got away with because people know you? [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1822.8s)]
*  Law enforcement know you. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1826.8s)]
*  That was pretty wild. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1829.8s)]
*  I don't know if they knew him like that. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1831.8s)]
*  But that was just a good old day. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1833.8s)]
*  The cops not wanting to do the painting. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1834.8s)]
*  Nah, you know what you get away with? [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1835.8s)]
*  What I've gotten away with the most is driving without a license. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1836.8s)]
*  But I've also got arrested a lot for that shit. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1839.8s)]
*  You've never had a license? [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1841.8s)]
*  I just recently got one. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1842.8s)]

*  Thank you very much. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1846.8s)]
*  And I didn't even take the driving test. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1847.8s)]
*  The kid just saw me because it was in my old neighborhood. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1850.8s)]
*  He was like, yo, here you go, license. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1852.8s)]
*  He took a picture. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1854.8s)]
*  We drove around. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1856.8s)]
*  He asked me a couple of questions about some songs. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1857.8s)]
*  I might be a faker. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1860.8s)]
*  He's like, I got the good license. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1861.8s)]
*  I don't think you got a license. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1863.8s)]
*  I have a license, dog. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1866.8s)]
*  I have one. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1867.8s)]
*  I have a passport card. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1868.8s)]
*  I have it all. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1869.8s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1870.8s)]
*  So you've been driving the majority of your life without a license? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1872.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1876.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1877.8s)]
*  And when you need to rent a car, what do you do? [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1878.8s)]
*  Someone else's name. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1881.8s)]
*  Wow. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1882.8s)]
*  Yep. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1883.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1884.8s)]
*  It's not an easy life having to rely on other people for simple things. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1885.8s)]
*  It's really ridiculous. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1891.8s)]
*  That's why I got the license. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1893.8s)]
*  I was like, man, this is enough. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1894.8s)]
*  I'm old. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1895.8s)]
*  What the fuck am I doing? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1896.8s)]
*  I can't even buy a car in my own name. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1897.8s)]
*  When the dude saw you sit down for the appointment, was he like, you don't have a, was he a little [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1899.8s)]
*  bit surprised to see you? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1903.8s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1905.8s)]
*  He followed my life and my career. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1906.8s)]
*  I always, I've mentioned it before. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1908.8s)]
*  So I was like, I was, I always wanted to get one. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1910.8s)]
*  I wasn't able to, I wasn't able to actually make the move. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1913.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1916.8s)]
*  I finally made that move. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1917.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1918.8s)]
*  Cause it's time. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1919.8s)]
*  It's time consuming. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1920.8s)]
*  It's like going to fucking get the pre-check. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1921.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1923.8s)]
*  But every time. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1924.8s)]
*  You gotta book the appointment. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1925.8s)]
*  But every time I go there in the morning and I have to stand on the regular line, I'm [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1926.8s)]
*  infuriated. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1931.8s)]
*  So there's a thing I love about you that you don't do anything you don't want to do, but [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1933.8s)]
*  now I'm starting to realize that's not always good. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1936.8s)]
*  You know, like you're like, I could be in a five minute line to get pre-checked, but [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1938.8s)]
*  fuck that. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1941.8s)]
*  I am destructive. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1942.8s)]
*  Sometimes I'm self-destructive. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1943.8s)]
*  You know that song from back in the day? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1946.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1948.8s)]
*  Self-destruction. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1949.8s)]
*  I don't know that song. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1950.8s)]
*  Come on, bro. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1951.8s)]
*  Miss Melody? [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1952.8s)]
*  Don't know her either. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1953.8s)]
*  KRS-1? [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1955.8s)]
*  Know him. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1956.8s)]
*  They're related in some fashion. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1957.8s)]
*  It was kind of like a We Are the World song. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1959.8s)]
*  It was like a save hip hop. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1964.8s)]
*  You know, self-destruct, saving yourself from the self-destruction of not knowing yourself. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1966.8s)]
*  Yeah, he'd be doing that a lot. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1972.8s)]
*  Fix it. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1974.8s)]
*  What do you think the craziest thing you've seen on the New York City subway is? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1975.8s)]
*  I mean, bro. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1980.8s)]

*  Sex. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1988.8s)]
*  Flashers whacking off. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1992.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1994.8s)]

*  Ballroom dancing. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1997.8s)]
*  Ballroom is fire. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1998.8s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=1999.8s)]
*  I've seen, pretty much I don't know what I haven't seen. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2000.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2006.8s)]
*  I don't know what I haven't seen. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2007.8s)]
*  Getting a little taste of everything. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2009.8s)]
*  Yeah, you definitely get a flavor for it all. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2010.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2013.8s)]
*  Yo, what is left to do? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2014.8s)]
*  So much, so much. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2019.8s)]
*  For example. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2022.8s)]
*  I really love the ocean. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2023.8s)]
*  I've been seeing you fucking with Will and Scootin'. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2024.8s)]
*  You know Will and Will Scoot and these- [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2027.8s)]
*  How about these guys out there? [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2028.8s)]
*  Did you guys have a good time? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2029.8s)]
*  Dude, it's crap fun. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2030.8s)]
*  That's what I'm saying, but you know, Will takes me to the ocean and like- [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2031.8s)]
*  Is he pulling you in on a ski? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2035.8s)]
*  I have before in one of the craziest days ever. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2037.8s)]
*  You know, Will could teach me about the water, but he's a surfer. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2040.8s)]
*  I'm a bodyboarder. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2043.8s)]
*  He can only put me in the best position possible and I have to do the rest. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2044.8s)]
*  But that man, that's what I'm saying. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2048.8s)]
*  Like I let him, his family teaches my child to swim. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2051.8s)]
*  They're going to be Scootin' alumnus. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2054.8s)]
*  So that's how much I trust them. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2057.8s)]
*  So Will Scootin' runs the, well I guess they have the surf academy and they also have like swimming lessons out in Long Island. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2059.8s)]
*  But they also made the wave pool in Jersey that we went to. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2064.8s)]
*  But Will Scootin' is a fucking big wave surfing- [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2068.8s)]
*  Like he's one of the ghosts of Nazaree. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2071.8s)]
*  Literally one of the big wave surfing legends. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2073.8s)]
*  One of the only ones on the East Coast. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2076.8s)]
*  For sure maybe the only one on the island. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2078.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2082.8s)]
*  Well there's a kid who just won the Pipe Masters from the island. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2083.8s)]
*  Ballerang. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2086.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2087.8s)]
*  Ballerang, he's the man. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2088.8s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2089.8s)]
*  I've been in the lineup with him. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2090.8s)]
*  Really? [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2091.8s)]
*  I mean, yeah. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2092.8s)]
*  When you're out on these certain days like- [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2093.8s)]
*  Tell them about the jet ski when you were getting pulled in. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2095.8s)]
*  Because this is kind of gnarly. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2098.8s)]
*  Well this, I wasn't even as good as I am now. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2099.8s)]
*  I wasn't confident. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2101.8s)]
*  I didn't have fins on, nothing. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2102.8s)]
*  You went barefoot. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2104.8s)]
*  Yeah, just pulled up one day. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2105.8s)]
*  It was, I don't know, Christmas or some shit. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2107.8s)]
*  It was the first snow. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2109.8s)]
*  It was like 18 degrees. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2111.8s)]
*  It was a hurricane somewhere and we got crazy waves. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2113.8s)]
*  Went out to Long Island. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2119.8s)]
*  Met up with the homie. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2121.8s)]
*  He had the jet ski. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2122.8s)]
*  So I had the wetsuit on. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2123.8s)]
*  I had my board. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2124.8s)]
*  I hopped on the jet ski. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2125.8s)]
*  And he just started taking me in and out of these waves as if we were riding the wave [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2126.8s)]
*  on a board, you know? [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2131.8s)]
*  But on the jet ski, like taking you into the fucking heart of the wave. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2133.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2137.8s)]
*  That was a next level experience. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2138.8s)]
*  He's getting towed in, essentially. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2139.8s)]
*  But this was before I even got towed in. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2140.8s)]
*  I was just sitting on the thing while we were like- [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2142.8s)]
*  Oh! [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2145.8s)]
*  Yeah, he was fucking- [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2146.8s)]
*  You got to feel where you're supposed to be on the wave. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2147.8s)]
*  But not only that, he was just, he's like, watch this. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2149.8s)]
*  We're going to get tucked on the wave on the jet ski. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2151.8s)]
*  So the same thing that you would do on the board, he used the fucking jet ski and was [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2153.8s)]
*  in the goddamn wave. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2157.8s)]
*  Wow. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2158.8s)]
*  So all that stuff- [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2159.8s)]
*  So you're getting barreled while you're on the jet ski. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2160.8s)]
*  Barreled on the ski. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2161.8s)]
*  Are you on the shit in behind that's being dragged? [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2163.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2165.8s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2166.8s)]
*  That's when he picks you up. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2167.8s)]
*  I was just sitting on the- [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2168.8s)]
*  You guys are getting barreled. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2169.8s)]
*  I'm holding him and we're getting barreled. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2171.8s)]
*  I'm like, oh shit. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2173.8s)]
*  I'm holding the board. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2175.8s)]
*  I'm holding him. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2176.8s)]
*  So then he fucking, he's like, all right, this next one, I'm going to tell you when [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2177.8s)]
*  to jump and you just jump. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2180.8s)]
*  All right. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2182.8s)]
*  So he pulls me and he goes jump. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2183.8s)]
*  I jumped and I'm like, all right, boom. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2185.8s)]
*  And I'm just fucking gliding. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2187.8s)]
*  And I just see the waves start curling over my head. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2189.8s)]
*  And I just think to myself, motherfucker, this is ridiculously amazing. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2192.8s)]
*  It's just unbelievable. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2197.8s)]
*  Have you been to Slater's pool yet? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2199.8s)]
*  No. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2201.8s)]
*  We might need to go do that. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2202.8s)]
*  I was talking- [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2204.8s)]
*  It's a 100% fact I'm going to perform in that pool. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2206.8s)]
*  Bro, that wave is made for me. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2209.8s)]
*  That's a boogie wave. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2212.8s)]
*  That's a boogie. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2214.8s)]
*  Because you're tucked in the whole time. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2216.8s)]
*  You come in, you just get to fucking sit in there and just carve. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2220.8s)]
*  They made a Slater wave in Abu Dhabi that opened a week after we left. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2224.8s)]
*  I was fucking bummed about that. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2228.8s)]
*  But yeah, Slater's wave. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2230.8s)]
*  I hit him, matter of fact, recently. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2231.8s)]
*  He's like, bro, you got to come out and check the wave. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2233.8s)]
*  But I'm saying if I go, we got to- [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2235.8s)]
*  You invite me, I'm there. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2238.8s)]
*  Done. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2239.8s)]
*  I'm there. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2240.8s)]
*  I mean, it's all time experience. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2241.8s)]
*  Bro, I'm there. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2244.8s)]
*  I'm trying to go to all these places. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2245.8s)]
*  Switzerland invited me. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2247.8s)]
*  Go to Waco. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2248.8s)]
*  Waco, Texas has one. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2249.8s)]
*  I heard that was a crazy one. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2250.8s)]
*  That one is incredible. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2252.8s)]
*  I think that one is the most ocean-like. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2253.8s)]
*  Because with Slater's, you got to wait, I think, it's like a five minute wait for the train to basically come back to create the next wave. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2255.8s)]
*  Got it, got it. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2262.8s)]
*  This one is similar to Scudens where it just pumps out three waves at a time. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2263.8s)]
*  I love that. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2266.8s)]
*  Four waves at a time. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2267.8s)]
*  I mean, I've seen a lot of them. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2268.8s)]
*  Scudens makes 10 or 20 different waves. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2269.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2272.8s)]
*  Like cool fucking waves that you could really like perform on too. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2273.8s)]
*  Do you prefer the ocean or being in the pool? [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2276.8s)]
*  I prefer, I love the ocean, but the pool is the, that's where you train. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2278.8s)]
*  That's the training ground. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2282.8s)]
*  That's the gym. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2283.8s)]
*  All that, yeah, it's the gym. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2284.8s)]
*  All that time in the pool, bro, at one point, I was in the pool almost every other day when they were testing it. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2285.8s)]
*  Really? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2291.8s)]
*  I would lose 10 pounds daily being in that pool because you do five or 10 laps before you get on the wave and then he runs it consecutively for an hour or two hours. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2292.8s)]
*  And if you try and catch in a wave every two minutes, dog, that's cardio, man. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2303.8s)]
*  I would leave there my fucking hip flexors, everything. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2309.8s)]
*  So ripped at that point. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2312.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2314.8s)]
*  I just want to be shredded by tonight. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2317.8s)]
*  I know you want it back. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2320.8s)]
*  I just want to be shredded so bad. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2321.8s)]
*  Why not get on the, what is it called, the peptides get on the... [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2323.8s)]
*  I don't want that bullshit. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2327.8s)]
*  I want the real gear. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2329.8s)]
*  Wait a minute, the peptides ain't the real gear? [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2330.8s)]
*  Nah, you know, I want fucking Ronnie Coleman. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2332.8s)]
*  I want... [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2335.8s)]
*  Oh, no, what is it called? [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2336.8s)]
*  The Tren? [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2338.8s)]
*  Yeah, Tren balloon. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2339.8s)]
*  Tren is, you use that in conjunction with things. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2340.8s)]
*  You've taken steroids before? [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2343.8s)]
*  Yeah, when I was 24, it let me down because I was taking like Project steroids. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2344.8s)]
*  My homie was making the Tren. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2349.8s)]
*  Wait, wait. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2351.8s)]

*  What is making... [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2358.8s)]
*  He was drinking off the couch. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2359.8s)]
*  You water it and you let it drip into the bottle and it's yellow and you just shoot it in your ass. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2360.8s)]

*  You don't fucking bend over to shoot juice, bro. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2374.8s)]

*  So I'm getting fucked for no reason. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2384.8s)]
*  You stand up, you fucking turn your head, make sure that the fucking cheek muscle is showing, you fucking jam it. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2386.8s)]

*  I've seen my own tickets on there before, and here's what SeatGeek does that is different. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2695.0s)]
*  I'm looking at tickets for Travis Scott's concert. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2698.48s)]

*  But here's what SeatGeek does that's wonderful. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2704.0s)]
*  If you're looking for tickets, they have them color-coded to tell you what kind of deal [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2705.68s)]
*  it is. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2709.76s)]
*  Green means good, yellow means okay, red means bad. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2710.76s)]
*  Do not buy those tickets. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2712.96s)]

*  You want to go to one of these concerts that's crazy? [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2718.84s)]

*  They put all the tickets across the web in one place to make sure you're getting a good [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2723.78s)]
*  deal. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2726.78s)]
*  And again, like I said, each ticket price is rated on a 1 to 10 scale with color coding, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2727.78s)]
*  so it is dummy-proof. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=2732.38s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3435.36s)]
*  I'm glad that you chose that one line to tell me. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3436.36s)]
*  You think that there's people that found out about you through non-rap content and then [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3439.36s)]
*  went back to your rap and are surprised how nice you are? [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3446.36s)]
*  Yeah, 100% because at this point, a lot of people know me for the food show. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3450.36s)]
*  They know me, but there's people that know me just from rap. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3456.36s)]
*  Because oftentimes when a rapper has a personality, the bars might not be there. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3461.36s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3467.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3468.36s)]
*  I don't want to call it specific people, but it's like they're bigger than they are rappers. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3469.36s)]
*  Good. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3472.36s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3473.36s)]
*  They're bigger than they are good, exactly. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3474.36s)]
*  And the personality is its own thing, but you spit, bro. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3475.36s)]
*  Thank you, bro. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3481.36s)]
*  For sure. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3482.36s)]
*  For me, man, rap, there's not many people on earth that I think could rap with me. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3483.36s)]
*  And that's just being me. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3492.36s)]
*  I'm not like a fucking boastful guy. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3493.36s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3495.36s)]
*  That's just a fact. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3496.36s)]
*  For me, in my mind, rap sucks. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3497.36s)]
*  Rappers suck. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3501.36s)]
*  They don't have experiences. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3502.36s)]
*  The things they say aren't interesting. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3504.36s)]
*  It's really all about finding interesting music and saying interesting things, at least [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3506.36s)]
*  for me. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3511.36s)]
*  I have a diversity and a crazy amount of different things that you could say that'll touch me. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3512.36s)]
*  I get a whole bunch of shit. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3521.36s)]
*  It's a thirst for experience. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3523.36s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3525.36s)]
*  I want someone to make me laugh. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3526.36s)]
*  I want someone to mention something that I thought only I know about. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3531.36s)]
*  We got this thing in standup where sometimes a comic will be up there and they'll tell a [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3535.36s)]
*  joke. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3539.36s)]
*  And then they'll be like, I told that joke one time in Oklahoma, and this was the reaction, [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3540.36s)]
*  and the joke was about that. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3544.36s)]
*  And the second I see that, I'm like, you ain't living enough. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3545.36s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3547.36s)]
*  Your whole life is just on stage, so there's nothing for you to pull from. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3548.36s)]
*  And that's why I thought, I mean, I remember when I was looking some stuff up for you, [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3553.36s)]
*  it was like, I feel like you're one of those guys that could continue rapping until much [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3557.36s)]
*  later in life, because the identity is never built around youth. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3562.36s)]
*  It's built around passion. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3566.36s)]
*  For sure. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3568.36s)]
*  So it's like, you don't want to stop anytime soon, right? [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3569.36s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3573.36s)]
*  I mean, I'm not pressured. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3574.36s)]
*  Stopping cooking because you're not 25. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3575.36s)]
*  That's the whole thing. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3577.36s)]
*  I look at myself and I still feel like I exude some sort of youthfulness in my passion for [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3579.36s)]
*  things. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3587.36s)]
*  Sure, I'm fucking weathered. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3588.36s)]
*  Sure, I've been through the wringer of life, but I still have all kinds of new experiences [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3590.36s)]
*  that I'm delivering to the world and new type of new energy. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3596.36s)]
*  Like right now, I feel better than I've ever felt ever musically. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3600.36s)]
*  Because you grow with confidence as you succeed and you do things. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3606.36s)]
*  And just that tiny desk gave me a whole fucking new breath of fresh air with that. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3611.36s)]
*  A lot of people don't give a fuck about things. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3616.36s)]
*  You watch big artists tiny desk and then no one gives a fuck about it, really. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3620.36s)]
*  Like this one went the fuck off. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3625.36s)]
*  People seem to really gravitate to it and enjoy it. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3627.36s)]
*  You were lost in it, bro. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3630.36s)]
*  Also, the opening, I imagine you're curating and orchestrating all this, right? [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3632.36s)]
*  Like song choice, everything. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3638.36s)]
*  I'm lucky to have some tremendous musicians around me. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3640.36s)]
*  Those are your guys? [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3644.36s)]
*  Yeah, those are my guys. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3646.36s)]
*  So with tiny desk, you bring your guys. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3647.36s)]
*  Well, I finally got my guys. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3649.36s)]
*  I never had a group of people that I'm confident with. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3651.36s)]
*  The keys and the sax is crazy. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3653.36s)]
*  Young Mexico, Matt Carillo. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3655.36s)]
*  He's one of the best musicians on earth right now. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3657.36s)]
*  And I tell everybody this. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3659.36s)]
*  I feel like all my guys are that. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3660.36s)]
*  Young Mexico is the best saxophone player on planet earth right now. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3662.36s)]
*  I love it. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3665.36s)]
*  For real. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3666.36s)]
*  I love it. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3667.36s)]
*  For real. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3668.36s)]
*  Like man, that motherfucker makes everybody cry. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3669.36s)]
*  I'm on stage going through it and it ain't no joke. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3672.36s)]
*  Like shit, I'm fucking crying. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3676.36s)]
*  You can tell you're locked in. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3678.36s)]
*  There's a... [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3679.36s)]
*  This motherfucker is literally like the most whimsical, gentle human being I've ever met. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3680.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3686.36s)]
*  And just like... [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3687.36s)]
*  No, it set a tone. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3688.36s)]
*  God damn fucking... [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3690.36s)]
*  I don't know the terminology they use in the horn world, but man, he can blow that thing. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3691.36s)]
*  Yeah, the tone was... [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3698.36s)]
*  Even the first song, like knock him out the box. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3701.36s)]
*  That's right. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3704.36s)]
*  But... [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3705.36s)]
*  You gotta set the tone. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3706.36s)]
*  There's a confidence to it. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3707.36s)]
*  It is an arrogance. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3709.36s)]
*  It's like, hey, I'm supposed to be here and I'm nice and I'm gonna show you why I'm nice. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3710.36s)]
*  And then immediately after it, you're just like so affected by the music. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3716.36s)]
*  You. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3721.36s)]
*  Like there's a great part, the last one you're doing, the banger, obviously, where it looked [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3722.36s)]
*  like you were a little scared to sing. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3725.96s)]
*  Were you? [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3728.6800000000003s)]
*  Like were you like... [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3729.6800000000003s)]
*  There was a lot of 40 year old women in there and I'm saying bitch and fucking this. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3730.6800000000003s)]
*  I didn't want to say... [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3734.6s)]
*  There was certain things I didn't want to say, I might not be able to touch my toes, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3736.56s)]
*  but I will still fuck these hoes while I'm looking directly at a 40 year old woman. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3741.88s)]
*  It's NPR. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3746.0s)]
*  Keep that in mind. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3747.0s)]
*  Tiny Desk is run by NPR, right? [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3748.0s)]
*  I remember you apologized to a boy. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3749.0s)]
*  You were like, I'm sorry. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3750.0s)]
*  I apologized because there was a fucking kid standing right there. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3751.0s)]
*  That's what I thought. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3754.0s)]
*  And I loved that moment. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3755.0s)]
*  I was like, man, you know, like, bro, you're gonna have to... [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3756.0s)]
*  Nah, this is the funniest part. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3758.0s)]
*  You bring the fucking kid, you're gonna hear some shit. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3759.0s)]
*  He goes, I'm sorry, I just want to let you guys know, I can't touch my toes. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3762.0s)]
*  He didn't say I'm sorry, fuck, didn't tell us that. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3766.12s)]
*  I can. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3769.4s)]
*  That was a big thing for me. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3770.4s)]
*  At one point I couldn't touch him and it's like... [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3771.4s)]
*  Oh shit. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3773.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3774.4s)]
*  See how simple that was? [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3775.4s)]
*  I didn't even breathe. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3776.4s)]
*  I didn't even breathe. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3777.4s)]
*  How did you prep for the Tiny Desk? [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3778.4s)]
*  Were you nervous at all going into it? [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3780.2s)]
*  I didn't prep. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3781.56s)]
*  No prep at all? [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3782.56s)]
*  Nah, there was some... [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3783.56s)]
*  I don't prep. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3784.56s)]
*  I don't prep. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3785.56s)]
*  With the band? [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3786.56s)]
*  We had been doing a couple of shows. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3787.56s)]
*  We had just done a couple of shows and then we caught lightning in the bottle. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3789.08s)]
*  Those guys are sick every night, but that was one of the best performances we've had. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3792.52s)]
*  Also when... [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3796.32s)]
*  Everyone was on fire. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3797.32s)]
*  When you fucked up the line and you said, run it back, and then kept it in. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3798.32s)]
*  That's how I do it, no matter what. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3801.72s)]
*  If I fuck up, I'm running it back. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3803.4s)]
*  You don't deserve that. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3805.12s)]
*  I don't deserve that. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3806.56s)]
*  I have to fix it. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3808.56s)]
*  It's a great Tiny Desk. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3809.88s)]
*  And I've seen a few Tiny Desks too and there's some people that have these... [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3811.4s)]
*  I think that's a real, obviously, to say it sounds obvious, but I'm considerate when I'm [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3815.92s)]
*  saying it. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3820.24s)]
*  It's a real performer stage, meaning if you have that skill. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3821.24s)]
*  There's some people who make music that's great to ride to, but when you see them perform [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3824.8799999999997s)]
*  it, rap, a lot of times, it's boring. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3828.0s)]
*  Lackluster. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3830.8799999999997s)]
*  Rap, low key sucks live. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3831.8799999999997s)]
*  It's trash. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3833.8799999999997s)]
*  I'm not a fan of it. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3834.8799999999997s)]
*  It's trash. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3835.8799999999997s)]
*  Almost every rap concert I went to live, I'm like, why am I here? [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3836.8799999999997s)]
*  It's embarrassing. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3838.4399999999996s)]
*  It's actually about... [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3839.4399999999996s)]
*  I know this. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3840.4399999999996s)]
*  You need live instruments. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3841.4399999999996s)]
*  I don't know why every... [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3842.4399999999996s)]
*  Jay-Z figured that out as well when he did the Rock Nation Orchestra. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3843.4399999999996s)]
*  And I remember seeing that live and I was like, ooh, this is a different feeling. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3847.64s)]
*  And the energy, it taps into human... [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3850.48s)]
*  I don't know, that primal instinct. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3854.44s)]
*  You need it. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3857.16s)]
*  You need to feel percussion. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3858.16s)]
*  You need to feel the strings. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3859.16s)]
*  Hearing 20 or 30 people playing in unison is powerful. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3861.72s)]
*  I mean, to have an orchestra is only Jay-Z could do that. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3864.8399999999997s)]
*  And dudes of that nature, it's not easy to put together quality musicians to play music. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3868.4s)]
*  Luckily for me, my music isn't like rapity rap beats. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3876.24s)]
*  Because to me, that shit sucks when you bring a guy in, you're like a band playing a hip-hop [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3881.2799999999997s)]
*  beat. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3886.48s)]
*  They're trying to recreate something that was made. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3887.48s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3889.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it's like... [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3890.9199999999996s)]
*  What we're playing is I'm using the most incredible samples of music, like the pieces of music. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3891.9199999999996s)]
*  That are already instruments, yeah. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3896.48s)]
*  It's the best musicians that are playing the instruments there. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3898.3599999999997s)]
*  That's why you're playing the best piece of music that could possibly be made. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3901.72s)]
*  Like Singled Out. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3906.68s)]
*  You don't have to play a break beat over it where there's a chance for it to fuck up. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3908.16s)]
*  You have to play the goddamn groove and that's it. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3913.3599999999997s)]
*  You get to be a real musician, not a hip-hop band. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3917.08s)]
*  It reminds me of like... [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3922.6s)]
*  You ever see... [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3924.7599999999998s)]
*  Most of the times you see a Van Gogh, right? [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3926.4399999999996s)]
*  You see a print of it, right? [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3928.52s)]
*  That has no texture at all. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3931.2s)]
*  And then you see it in real life and you realize this is a three-dimensional fucking painting. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3933.04s)]
*  And you're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3937.52s)]
*  This is what it was meant to be seen as and this is what I'm supposed to be indulgent [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3939.28s)]
*  in. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3942.96s)]
*  I feel like that's the same way when you're trying to take something that was made electronically [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3943.96s)]
*  and turn it into music. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3947.18s)]
*  It's better than nothing. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3948.4s)]
*  But when you take the thing that's meant to be and was born through instruments and then [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3949.92s)]
*  you play that. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3954.28s)]
*  This means a lot to me because you get it. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3955.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3956.92s)]
*  That means you understand. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3958.52s)]
*  But the live performance, I've always thought about that with like especially rap. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3959.62s)]
*  It's like, bro, the majority of... [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3962.4s)]
*  I don't even... [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3964.6s)]
*  If you're only in it for money, let's say you are, not you, but the average person, [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3966.64s)]
*  let's say that's into rap is like only for money. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3970.36s)]
*  You have to recognize that the live show, there's a reason why people are not going [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3972.52s)]
*  to tune in. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3975.28s)]
*  That's a humongous part. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3977.28s)]
*  I mean, if you're lucky enough to just have massive hits and you're not that talented, [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3978.28s)]
*  you don't have to take your show on the road. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3984.36s)]
*  I take my show on the road because it's like worth coming to see. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3986.6s)]
*  There's people who really want to come and fucking watch me every night because I put [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3990.24s)]
*  on a fucking experience. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3993.92s)]
*  I literally, you get everything. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3997.64s)]
*  You get comedy, you get fucking emotion, you get some of the most incredible music. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=3999.92s)]
*  It's like a roller coaster of emotion you get. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4007.46s)]
*  I heard two friends that went to different concerts of yours, one in Dallas where I grew [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4011.32s)]
*  up, they said you took an outside microphone outside on the street very quickly. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4015.92s)]
*  And then another one, this is a fire. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4021.48s)]
*  What you mean outside? [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4022.88s)]
*  I mean, I've done that. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4023.88s)]
*  I've been doing that forever. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4024.88s)]
*  I usually leave the venue. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4025.88s)]
*  I take people outside with me in the street. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4027.4s)]
*  It's like Steve Martin used to do this kind of thing. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4029.68s)]
*  It's like dumped. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4031.72s)]
*  I used to go open the fucking mezzanine and just go... [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4032.72s)]
*  Just dump shit. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4036.6s)]
*  I used to go in the crowd a lot. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4037.6s)]
*  That stopped though. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4039.7599999999998s)]
*  They started fucking trampling me. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4040.7599999999998s)]
*  I fucking had 20 people hanging on my neck. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4043.56s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4046.2s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4047.2s)]
*  This is a cool story. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4048.2s)]
*  And this is when I started to understand there's like a mythology around you that you live [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4049.2s)]
*  up to. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4052.0s)]
*  My comic friend of ours, Matt Pavich, been a fan of yours forever, Queens guy. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4053.0s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4056.76s)]
*  And he said he was going to your concert, saw your car, recognized your car, it was [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4057.76s)]
*  a gold something, something that you'd wrapped about. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4060.68s)]
*  Homies driving, you're in the passenger seat. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4063.28s)]
*  He said you'd remember this story. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4065.32s)]
*  They're like, yo, action, action, action. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4066.64s)]
*  You roll down the window. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4068.6s)]
*  They roll down the window. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4069.74s)]
*  And you flick a fat ass rapper joint on the highway directly into their car. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4070.7799999999997s)]
*  100%. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4074.8599999999997s)]
*  And... [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4075.8599999999997s)]
*  I remember throwing this joint into their window. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4076.8599999999997s)]
*  I couldn't fucking believe it made it in. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4078.8599999999997s)]
*  And he said... [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4081.8599999999997s)]
*  This is what I'm saying. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4082.8599999999997s)]
*  I'm fucking nice like that. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4083.8599999999997s)]
*  I knew the wind. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4084.8599999999997s)]
*  I had to throw it this way. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4085.8599999999997s)]
*  And then the velocity brought it directly into their window. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4086.8599999999997s)]
*  And then he said he went to the concert. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4091.8599999999997s)]
*  It was with Das Racist. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4093.8599999999997s)]
*  That's how long ago it was. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4094.8599999999997s)]
*  Das Racist is a rap band, New York band, Shouts to Heems, but like a decade ago. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4095.8599999999997s)]
*  And then he said you just didn't like the energy of the crowd or something. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4100.66s)]
*  And it's not legal at this point, but you go grab a fucking hefty bag of wheat and just [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4103.66s)]
*  start throwing it into the crowd. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4108.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4109.66s)]
*  Which is just like in 2013, 14, whatever. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4110.66s)]
*  Like there's cops there. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4113.66s)]
*  I was crazy. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4114.66s)]
*  He said the cops were just like, I don't know if we're supposed to arrest this guy or... [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4115.66s)]
*  They loved it. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4120.42s)]
*  The cops fucking loved it. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4121.42s)]
*  I've given away so many things. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4123.18s)]
*  I've given away full barbecues. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4124.58s)]
*  Like assembled barbecues. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4128.66s)]
*  Like a grill? [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4130.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4131.66s)]
*  Smoker. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4132.66s)]

*  So with winemakers, you have to feel it. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4771.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4774.46s)]
*  You have to fucking like to want to work with somebody. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4775.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4777.38s)]
*  That, olive oil is a little bit easier for me. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4778.38s)]
*  I taste what I want. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4782.38s)]
*  I talk with my man who was the top oleologist on earth who also plays bass in the bank. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4783.66s)]
*  My man Nicholas Coleman. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4790.1s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4791.1s)]
*  We have a lot of random connection. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4792.1s)]
*  Bro, it's crazy. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4794.1s)]
*  He plays fucking an unbelievable bass. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4795.26s)]
*  This Berkeley graduate also happens to be the top expert on olive oil on earth. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4797.740000000001s)]
*  So he's just a phrase. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4803.740000000001s)]
*  He's just a brilliant guy. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4804.740000000001s)]
*  So that's how we work. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4806.660000000001s)]
*  He chases the harvest, northern hemisphere, southern hemisphere, depending on the time [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4810.14s)]
*  of year. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4814.360000000001s)]
*  And we get the freshest oil we taste from different people that he's built relationships [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4816.18s)]
*  throughout the years. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4820.86s)]
*  I taste the best. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4822.54s)]
*  We come to a conclusion. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4824.0599999999995s)]
*  I do the art and we execute. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4825.22s)]
*  Okay. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4828.3s)]
*  Do you have like your business people making contracts and stuff like this? [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4829.82s)]
*  How do you make it official? [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4834.98s)]
*  That's the thing. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4837.3s)]
*  Well, with people like that, it's official when you have a lawyer in a handshake. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4838.3s)]
*  That's it. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4841.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4842.62s)]
*  Done. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4843.62s)]
*  Okay. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4844.62s)]
*  That's something that I want to give some credit to. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4846.58s)]
*  Did you edit your old stuff or do you have an editor that was doing it? [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4848.66s)]
*  As far as what? [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4852.5s)]
*  Even your old, the vlogs and stuff like that were edited in a really funny way. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4854.34s)]
*  Meaning like there were moments that weren't funny, but because of the editing, they're [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4860.42s)]
*  hilarious. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4864.5s)]
*  Well, when I was with Vice, I've been working with one producer forever, my man Chris Grosso. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4865.5s)]
*  Literally, he sees the show while it's happening. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4870.82s)]
*  So with Ancient Aliens, while we were watching that shit, at time that Vic Berger dude, you [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4876.66s)]
*  remember Vic Berger? [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4883.1s)]
*  He would like do all those crazy cuts. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4884.1s)]
*  Crazy edits. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4885.58s)]
*  So we used him to edit the Ancient Alien shows and people of that mind frame to make weird [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4886.58s)]
*  things funny. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4893.02s)]
*  That's not funny. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4894.02s)]
*  You know, like if I touch your leg, he would just be like, do a close-up of me just touching [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4895.26s)]
*  your ankle very gently. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4899.740000000001s)]
*  It'd be classic. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4900.740000000001s)]
*  So they're injecting the comedy into it. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4901.740000000001s)]
*  Some of that, but a lot of the food stuff, it's just done in a different vein. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4903.860000000001s)]
*  We're moving at a different speed, man. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4910.9800000000005s)]
*  But there's a moment where who is it, you and the dude, there's a black dude that's [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4913.900000000001s)]
*  with you and he's like, you guys are eating like a patty that's inside a sandwich somewhere. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4918.06s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4923.02s)]
*  Oh yeah, my man Mayhem. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4924.02s)]
*  Okay. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4925.3s)]
*  And he goes, what do you think about it? [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4926.3s)]
*  He goes, I think it's a good patty. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4929.18s)]
*  And then you go, that's some good commentary. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4934.740000000001s)]
*  But like most editors wouldn't put that there, right? [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4939.18s)]
*  Because they're like, I don't know if this is pushing the show or whatever, but I feel [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4945.18s)]
*  like there's a lot of those moments that make the show feel more authentic. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4948.26s)]
*  That's really what it's about. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4951.700000000001s)]
*  Keeping the awkwardness. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4952.700000000001s)]
*  There's a joke that I'm even watching one and you make a joke in one of the kitchens [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4954.38s)]
*  and it kind of bombs. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4958.54s)]
*  And then you kind of call it out. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4960.42s)]
*  Everything bombs. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4963.0599999999995s)]
*  But that's the beauty of it. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4964.0599999999995s)]
*  Because it's like- [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4965.9s)]
*  That's some of my favorite shit is bombing. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4966.9s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4968.86s)]
*  I wish I could fucking show you some of the movie auditions I've done. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4969.86s)]
*  Bro, if we could get the fucking audition I did for Uncut Gems, we'd all be fucking [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4975.3s)]
*  dying right now. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4980.78s)]
*  Hold on, should I hit up? [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4981.86s)]
*  Hit him up. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4983.86s)]
*  Let me hit up, Benny. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4984.86s)]
*  Hit him up. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4985.86s)]
*  I know those motherfuckers got it because I want to see it. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4986.86s)]
*  What character were you going for? [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4988.66s)]
*  Who I don't know. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4989.66s)]
*  I was in the fucking store talking some shit. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4990.66s)]
*  I made believe Shaq was in there. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4993.179999999999s)]
*  Hold on, don't give it away. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4995.179999999999s)]
*  Let me see. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4998.179999999999s)]
*  I'm going to pay you time. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=4999.179999999999s)]
*  This is an unseen thing. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5000.179999999999s)]
*  I don't know where it is. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5002.9s)]
*  If you could get this, God bless. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5004.38s)]
*  Wait, so you just walked into the audition with them? [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5007.259999999999s)]
*  Nah, you know, like I know it's all friends of friends of friends. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5010.58s)]
*  So I've done several auditions where it was just like, what am I doing here? [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5014.66s)]
*  When I auditioned for the Irishman, I couldn't even see the paper. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5019.18s)]
*  I asked the 70-year-old woman for her glasses. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5022.66s)]
*  Action. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5025.18s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5026.18s)]
*  Dog, do you have the fucking audition footage from Uncut Gems? [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5027.18s)]
*  Find it please, for God's sakes. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5033.22s)]
*  We need to see that. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5034.46s)]
*  It was the worst shit ever. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5035.46s)]
*  I needed it immediately. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5038.18s)]
*  We have to put it out. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5040.14s)]
*  We've got to put it out there? [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5041.14s)]
*  Come on, please. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5042.14s)]
*  Let me ask Jen, because she's the cast degree. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5043.14s)]
*  She definitely has it somewhere. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5044.14s)]
*  She was mean also. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5045.14s)]
*  She wasn't nice to me at all, because I was a little late. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5046.14s)]
*  Not going to lie, I was stoned also. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5047.14s)]
*  If you can get past her, then you get to the next one. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5048.14s)]
*  That's why, obviously, she wasn't feeling me. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5049.14s)]
*  Get us that audition, Benny, please. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5050.14s)]
*  I was filming the pod right now. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5051.14s)]
*  He said he brought up the ghost. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5052.14s)]
*  I was like, what? [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5053.14s)]

*  Interesting. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5111.14s)]
*  In what way? [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5133.14s)]
*  What do you think that's from? [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5141.14s)]
*  It's not like a potential freak off situation. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5145.14s)]
*  Everything is a potential freak off situation. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5150.14s)]
*  It's like, I don't know, insecurities. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5153.14s)]
*  Oh, exactly. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5157.14s)]
*  So his shorty is kind of really pressing you. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5158.14s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5161.14s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5162.14s)]
*  It just seems like who's this guy, this fucking weirdo looking guy, this interesting character. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5163.14s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5166.14s)]
*  What I find interesting about you, and I want to ask you about this, you seem completely [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5167.14s)]
*  secure, confident. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5171.14s)]
*  You pursue your passions as it, and I think that's something people are drawn to. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5173.14s)]
*  And then I want to ask you, is that something you felt like you've always had, or were there [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5177.14s)]
*  a couple of seminal moments where you're like, yeah, I don't want to chase this thing. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5180.3s)]
*  I don't want to be insecure about this thing, and then you just let it go. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5183.64s)]
*  Yeah, I never want to feel insecure, period. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5186.14s)]
*  I don't want to feel rejection. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5188.14s)]
*  I guess that's also a thing. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5190.14s)]
*  That's also one of those, that's an insecurity, not wanting to feel that type of thing. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5192.14s)]
*  Of course. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5196.14s)]
*  That type of thing. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5197.14s)]
*  So that's maybe why I keep to myself and only satisfy myself, because I know and I've realized [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5198.14s)]
*  you can't satisfy everybody, and if you try, you're going to miserably fail. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5203.14s)]
*  There's only really one person that needs to be satisfied with what they're doing, and [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5208.14s)]
*  that's me. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5212.14s)]
*  I'm the motherfucking one doing it. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5213.14s)]
*  I'm wasting my time, so I feel like I have to, it has to touch me in a way. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5215.14s)]
*  It's brutal when you do something that is not authentic to you to impress somebody else, [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5220.14s)]
*  and they reject it. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5227.14s)]
*  Fuck it. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5228.14s)]
*  Oh, you feel nauseous because you know you shouldn't have did it anyway. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5229.14s)]
*  You rejected yourself. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5231.14s)]
*  They reject you. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5232.14s)]
*  I've done it. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5233.14s)]
*  I've felt it before. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5234.14s)]
*  What happened? [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5235.14s)]
*  I knew you were going to ask for a pinpoint, but it's not, when you asked me what happened, [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5236.14s)]
*  I don't fucking remember that quick. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5239.14s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5241.14s)]
*  Entertainment-wise, private life. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5242.14s)]
*  So many things, so many things. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5244.14s)]
*  So many things, I knew I should have fucking put myself out there. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5246.14s)]
*  Or even reaching out to somebody and they leave you on read or some shit. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5250.14s)]
*  Something that simple. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5257.14s)]
*  And it's like you didn't even want to fuck with them in the first place. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5259.14s)]
*  I'm doing it just because I felt like I needed to for a look. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5261.14s)]
*  I'm like, bro, I don't fucking need this goddamn look. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5266.14s)]
*  I'm doing you a favor by hitting you up. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5268.14s)]
*  What are we doing? [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5270.14s)]
*  But I've always had this confidence in myself where I felt like I knew I was mad judgmental [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5272.14s)]
*  about shit, but on the low, you know, like, nah, I don't fuck with that. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5281.14s)]
*  I don't like it. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5284.14s)]
*  I like this. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5285.14s)]
*  I knew what I liked. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5286.14s)]
*  That's things, sometimes people look at that as like the judgmental side is insecurity. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5287.14s)]
*  I don't think it's insecurity if you know what you like. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5291.14s)]
*  There's a difference between just being a hater because you think you suck. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5293.14s)]
*  Definitely not a hater. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5296.14s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5297.14s)]
*  But because you'll give it up if you think someone's being authentic. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5298.14s)]
*  I'm like, I'm gonna give it up all day. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5301.14s)]
*  And that's the other thing is like, I love everybody shit. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5302.14s)]
*  I love I love to give props, especially if you're nice. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5304.14s)]
*  If you're nice, I just want to scream your fucking name and your talent to the rooftop. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5307.14s)]
*  But if it's whack, I can't just say it's nice because you're nice. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5311.14s)]
*  I know. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5315.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5316.14s)]
*  It's a tough situation sometimes because there's a lot of people I like that I don't love their [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5317.14s)]
*  work. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5320.14s)]
*  It's just it is what it is. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5321.14s)]
*  What do you say when they're like, how do you feel about this? [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5323.14s)]
*  I'd rather they not ask. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5326.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5328.14s)]
*  I do. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5329.14s)]
*  I lie. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5330.14s)]
*  Because you don't want to hurt their feelings. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5331.14s)]
*  Because I know I'm gonna be deemed a dick. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5334.14s)]
*  By this person that you like. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5338.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5340.14s)]
*  How do you turn down features that you don't want to do? [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5341.14s)]
*  I don't do anything. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5343.14s)]
*  I don't do anything. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5344.14s)]
*  I save ridiculous amount of money. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5345.14s)]
*  I charge an unbelievable amount of money. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5348.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5350.14s)]
*  If you want to pay that, then I'll do it. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5351.14s)]
*  If not, if you're hitting me up out of the blue and we don't know each other and you're [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5352.14s)]
*  asking me for a feature. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5355.14s)]
*  There's no way. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5356.14s)]
*  Come on. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5357.14s)]
*  This is business. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5358.14s)]
*  Bro, that's so good. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5359.14s)]
*  You made it business by doing that. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5360.14s)]
*  I just, you can't. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5361.14s)]
*  I would never do that. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5362.14s)]
*  I would never do that. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5364.14s)]
*  That's my ethics. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5365.14s)]
*  I couldn't imagine someone. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5366.14s)]
*  People have goals. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5367.14s)]
*  Some people are shameless, bro. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5368.14s)]
*  Some people don't care. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5369.14s)]
*  They don't even care if you reject it. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5370.14s)]
*  They have one goal. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5371.14s)]
*  What if it's one of those artists that you know of, but you don't really respect their [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5372.14s)]
*  art? [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5373.14s)]
*  So it's like you have a relationship with them and then they ask you for a feature. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5374.14s)]
*  I've done it. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5375.14s)]
*  You still just tell them a crazy price. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5376.14s)]
*  I've done it. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5377.14s)]
*  Or you did the feature. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5378.14s)]
*  I've done it. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5379.14s)]
*  You do the feature. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5380.14s)]
*  I've done it. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5381.14s)]
*  I've done it. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5382.14s)]
*  I've done it. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5383.14s)]
*  I've done it. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5389.14s)]
*  But that's why I don't do things anymore because I'm like, you know what? [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5390.14s)]

*  No, there's a lot of dudes that are around that don't know how to do the smooth. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5527.14s)]
*  The closure here, sometimes it's sideways. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5530.14s)]
*  It needs to be a full on rub. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5534.14s)]
*  That's one of those things that annoys me so much. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5535.14s)]

*  A couple people here. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5543.14s)]
*  You set the tone or he went in for it with you. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5544.14s)]
*  Set the tone crazy. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5546.14s)]
*  Like what up? [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5547.14s)]

*  And we're the notch. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5553.14s)]
*  No way. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5556.14s)]
*  He did it to me with his eyes. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5557.14s)]
*  Bro, Adam. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5562.14s)]
*  What you think about these new quarks, bro? [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5563.14s)]
*  I didn't like it. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5568.14s)]
*  I lied about it and said I was all right. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5571.14s)]
*  I didn't like it. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5573.14s)]
*  It's ass. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5574.14s)]
*  Bro, the new quarks are ass. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5575.14s)]
*  I don't like that shit at all. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5576.14s)]
*  I hate shit like that. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5577.14s)]
*  It's tough to see the garden in anything other than that linoleum hardwood. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5578.14s)]
*  But change is always good too, but it got to be good. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5584.14s)]
*  Like why are you doing some trash? [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5587.14s)]
*  Who okayed that design? [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5589.14s)]
*  And I'd like to be involved in that decision the next time. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5592.14s)]
*  Would they bring someone like you in for consultation? [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5595.14s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5599.14s)]
*  Like once again, people like to put thumbs on things. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5600.14s)]
*  I fucking put your thumb in your ass. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5603.14s)]
*  I could do it all. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5605.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5606.14s)]
*  My only thing is like you're not going to wiggle. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5607.14s)]
*  No, Dan. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5610.14s)]

*  Yeah, I go for it. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5638.14s)]
*  I speak with passion. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5639.14s)]
*  And if I'm in the room, I'm not going to let that opportunity slip. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5640.14s)]
*  It's guaranteed. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5643.14s)]
*  I don't know if it's guaranteed, but I'm definitely going to do what I have to do. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5644.14s)]
*  And if you're not feeling it, then I'll just have to live with it. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5647.14s)]
*  Then I'll fucking have to go back to the drawing board. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5650.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5653.14s)]

*  Have you been in front of audiences that you've seen flip? [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5671.14s)]
*  100%. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5675.14s)]
*  Because you go out there, they don't know who you are. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5676.14s)]
*  Throw a 70-inch TV out there, people suddenly like you. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5678.14s)]
*  They already liked me by then. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5681.14s)]
*  I was just showing love at that. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5683.14s)]
*  I was saying thank you. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5685.14s)]
*  By that time, I was thanking them for loving me. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5686.14s)]
*  But early on, of course. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5689.14s)]
*  When you're opening for people or something. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5691.14s)]
*  I didn't do a lot of that. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5693.14s)]
*  I didn't do a lot of that because in the era I came up in, [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5695.14s)]
*  there was enough space to do your own little show [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5698.14s)]
*  where you could do 500 people alone. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5702.14s)]
*  Just build off that. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5704.14s)]
*  500,000, 2,000, 3,000, 5,000, fucking 50,000 people. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5706.14s)]
*  But tell me about the flip. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5712.14s)]
*  That's what I'm interested in with music. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5713.14s)]
*  The flip is you come out there, you look the way you do, [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5715.14s)]
*  and you fucking rap your goddamn ass off. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5719.14s)]
*  And by the second, third song, they're cheering for you. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5722.14s)]
*  You feel it. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5725.14s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5726.14s)]
*  You can see it in their eyes. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5727.14s)]
*  They're like, I... [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5728.14s)]
*  I look in their eyes. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5729.14s)]
*  I'm fucking looking in each person's eyes. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5730.14s)]
*  There was only 20 people in the room, so I'm fucking looking at you. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5734.14s)]
*  And they went from, oh shit, where am I at? [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5737.14s)]
*  To, oh god, this guy is going to blow the fuck up. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5739.14s)]
*  I don't know if they thought that, [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5741.14s)]
*  but they definitely were going to follow me after that. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5743.14s)]
*  They became fans. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5745.14s)]
*  Yeah, that's real. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5749.14s)]
*  You just need a chance. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5750.14s)]
*  You know, sometimes you just have to meet somebody [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5751.14s)]
*  or see what they have to offer, [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5754.14s)]
*  and then you can change your mind about them. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5757.14s)]
*  Do we have some locks for this week? [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5759.14s)]
*  Oh, baby, I got them. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5760.14s)]
*  Let me get the exact yardage up. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5762.14s)]
*  Raheem Mostert, I think, is going to get more than 49.5 rushing yards. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5763.14s)]
*  The Dolphins are a great running team. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5767.14s)]
*  I trust he can get that. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5768.14s)]
*  DJ Moore, less than 62.5 receiving yards. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5770.14s)]
*  He's going up against the Browns defense. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5774.14s)]
*  I just think their pass rush is so good. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5775.14s)]
*  It's going to affect Justin Fields. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5777.14s)]
*  And Jordan Love, the Packers are on a heater. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5778.14s)]
*  More than 1.5 passing touchdowns. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5780.14s)]
*  Those are the Sing locks, Schultz locks. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5782.14s)]
*  And Price picks is going to match 100% of that initial deposit bonus up to $100. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5785.14s)]
*  And, tail the picks, go to the playoff game. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5789.14s)]
*  Of course, both of those. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5791.14s)]
*  Okay, but what does that mean? [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5793.14s)]
*  That means that if you put in 100, they're also giving you 100. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5794.14s)]
*  Then you go tail those picks. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5797.14s)]
*  Now you're going to watch a damn playoff game? [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5799.14s)]
*  Like, this is an absolute no-brainer. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5801.14s)]
*  Let's get back to the show. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5803.14s)]
*  All right, guys, we're going to take a break for a second, [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5804.14s)]
*  because, listen, this pipe sees dust. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5806.14s)]
*  This absolute pipe sees it, okay? [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5809.14s)]
*  You got to go Super Mario Bros. on whatever girls in your life. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5812.14s)]
*  And the way you're going to do that is with the chew. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5816.14s)]
*  Blue chew, that's your mushroom. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5819.14s)]
*  Blue chew is your mushroom, okay? [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5821.14s)]
*  You pop that blue chew, same active ingredients inside, Viagra, Cialis, this is a chew. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5824.14s)]
*  This is the one that we rock with, okay? [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5829.14s)]
*  And you're going to get it for free. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5831.14s)]
*  All you got to do is pay the $5 shipping. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5833.14s)]
*  You're going to deliver the best dick of your life. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5834.14s)]
*  And you get it for free. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5837.14s)]
*  All you got to do is pay $5 shipping. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5838.14s)]
*  This is an absolute no-brainer. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5839.14s)]
*  You just go to bluechew.com, use the promo code flagrant. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5840.14s)]
*  Simple as that. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5844.14s)]
*  Bluechew.com, use the promo code flagrant. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5845.14s)]
*  That's it. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5847.14s)]
*  Now let's get back to the show. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5848.14s)]
*  What happened to Vice? [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5849.14s)]
*  Fuck if I know, man. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5851.14s)]
*  Those guys, they had a beautiful thing going. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5853.14s)]
*  I don't really know the whole backstory behind shit. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5855.14s)]
*  All I know is that I had fucking carte blanche to do whatever. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5858.14s)]
*  And I was doing whatever. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5862.14s)]
*  I feel like that's when it flipped. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5864.14s)]
*  Now it's like... [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5866.14s)]
*  That's when it was fun. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5867.14s)]
*  That's when it was fun. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5868.14s)]
*  But I don't know if I was the fucking... [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5870.14s)]
*  I don't know if I was the reasoning shit went down. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5872.14s)]
*  Probably not. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5875.14s)]
*  Now I feel like it got bought. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5877.14s)]
*  Yeah, it feels a lot more corporate. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5880.14s)]
*  They sold to this thing and then all of a sudden... [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5882.14s)]
*  I think they pulled a fucking gag. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5884.14s)]
*  I think they did some weird shit. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5886.14s)]
*  I think that was... [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5888.14s)]
*  Actually, that's what happened. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5889.14s)]
*  They were trying to position themselves to get into some bidding wars, [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5891.14s)]
*  some dumb shit, and it ended up falling through, [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5896.14s)]
*  and they ended up getting nothing. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5899.14s)]
*  Oh, so they didn't get bought? [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5901.14s)]
*  I thought Andy bought them. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5903.14s)]
*  But I believe they got bought for a much lesser amount than it was initially thought. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5904.14s)]
*  I know they had a billion-dollar valuation or something crazy back in like 08, 09. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5910.14s)]
*  I think it was three or something like that. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5914.14s)]
*  Something more than that, yeah. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5915.14s)]
*  That's why... [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5916.14s)]
*  I mean, it was just dominating culture. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5917.14s)]
*  This one brand was dominating. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5918.14s)]
*  That's why I didn't sign with a regular label. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5921.14s)]
*  I signed with Vice. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5924.14s)]
*  It wasn't tremendous money, but everything that came from that is more than money. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5926.14s)]
*  It was freedom. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5932.14s)]
*  Much more than money. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5933.14s)]
*  I made phenomenal content for fucking six years that lives to this day. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5934.14s)]
*  Coming on the 10-year anniversary of Fuck That's Delicious. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5941.14s)]
*  I've had a show for 10 years. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5945.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's a long time. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5947.14s)]
*  It's a long time. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5948.14s)]
*  Five years on TV, five years on the internet. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5949.14s)]
*  Is it wild to see trends that you might have greatly influenced become very popular? [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5953.14s)]
*  Like, for example, just food content in and of itself online. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5963.14s)]
*  Now, there are other people that also did food content, but to see the popularity of that now... [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5967.14s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, in our age group, you could directly correlate that to me. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5974.14s)]
*  In our age group, definitely I was influenced by... [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5980.14s)]
*  I think it's you, it's Bourdain. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5983.14s)]
*  But that's what I'm saying. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5984.14s)]
*  We were influenced by them. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5985.14s)]
*  Bourdain and Andrew Zimmern and all these other guys were the predecessors of us. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5987.14s)]
*  They were our forefathers. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5992.14s)]
*  I came after, and this new wave came after me. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5993.14s)]
*  I feel like the new wave is not anything that Bourdain would have been happy with. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=5997.14s)]
*  Why is that? [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6002.14s)]
*  Because it's not thoughtful. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6003.14s)]
*  These are not thoughtful things at all. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6005.14s)]
*  He's made comments before that he only liked to watch me and a couple of other things. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6007.14s)]
*  So that's why I don't do run-of-the-mill shit. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6011.14s)]
*  That's why it doesn't always go viral and it's not like these tiktok-y food videos that do thoughtful pieces on real people, real institutions, real families, real chefs, real this, real... [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6016.14s)]
*  It's all thoughtful pieces. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6028.14s)]
*  These are not regurgitated and fucking like you're going here, I'm going here, I'm going to this fucking place. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6030.14s)]
*  It's bullshit. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6035.14s)]
*  It's bullshit. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6037.14s)]
*  You're going to this place for the first time, sure, you're standing on a street in Queens, you're just going to a bunch of places. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6038.14s)]
*  This guy has a fucking great bagel. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6044.14s)]
*  This has a great bagel. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6046.14s)]
*  Suck my dick. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6047.14s)]
*  I don't care. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6048.14s)]
*  Have you seen Leave the Meter Running, that show? [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6049.14s)]
*  No. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6052.14s)]
*  It's actually a tiktok show that's around this topic that I think that she does a good job, where the dude gets into an Uber or a taxi with someone. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6053.14s)]
*  And he'll basically be like, hey, where's your favorite restaurant in the city? [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6059.14s)]
*  What's the food you feel like represents your culture? [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6062.14s)]
*  Then he goes with them to the restaurant and then he talks with them about where they grew up, where they came from, how the food impacts the culture and then pays them for the whole rate that the meter was running. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6064.14s)]
*  I love that. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6073.14s)]
*  It's a really cool show. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6074.14s)]
*  I love that. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6075.14s)]
*  And now I think it's getting scaled to like TV. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6076.14s)]
*  It came from TikTok though. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6077.14s)]
*  It's named Kareem Rama. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6078.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6079.14s)]
*  But that's the thing is I feel like a lot of people are creating around things they like and not what they love. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6080.14s)]
*  And when you create around something that you love, it's hard to fail yourself. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6084.14s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6090.14s)]
*  Imagine doing a documentary on your mom. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6091.14s)]
*  Are you going to make a shitty documentary about your mom? [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6094.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6097.14s)]
*  So it's like, and I feel like a lot of people are just like, hey, I like eating. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6098.14s)]
*  Okay, I'll do that. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6103.14s)]
*  I like going out. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6104.14s)]
*  Okay, I'll create content around it. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6105.14s)]
*  Because anything that they see is popular at the moment. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6107.14s)]
*  They're going to try. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6110.14s)]
*  They're giving it a go. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6111.14s)]
*  But there are young guys doing it good because even Keith Lee, I love the way he works. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6112.14s)]
*  He's great. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6116.14s)]
*  Okay, coming from fucking, that's what I'm saying. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6117.14s)]
*  That's just beautiful. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6120.14s)]
*  But that's, Keith Lee is not a normal example. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6121.14s)]
*  That isn't an abnormal example of someone that popped off. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6126.14s)]
*  That's not a typical thing. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6130.14s)]
*  People do that all the time, sitting in their car fucking talking about some shit. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6132.14s)]
*  It doesn't pop off like Keith Lee. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6136.14s)]
*  I think. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6137.14s)]
*  The comic thread. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6138.14s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6139.14s)]
*  If you don't do that, it's going. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6140.14s)]
*  You gotta do that shit. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6142.14s)]
*  The concept both of y'all have, I think, is authenticity. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6144.14s)]
*  When I watch your shit and his shit, I trust you. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6147.14s)]
*  I'm like, oh, this guy is not, it's just him doing him. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6150.14s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6153.14s)]
*  He's in it for the real. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6154.14s)]
*  He wants to tell you how he really feels. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6155.14s)]
*  He's not going to sugarcoat it. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6157.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6158.14s)]
*  That's it. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6159.14s)]
*  His brother's an amazing fighter. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6160.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6161.14s)]
*  He was a fighter too. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6162.14s)]
*  I know. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6163.14s)]
*  He was a good fighter. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6164.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6165.14s)]
*  His brother was an amazing fighter. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6166.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6167.14s)]
*  It's weird. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6168.14s)]
*  Why are people not more, I guess you're aware of your passions. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6169.14s)]
*  I wonder if people just listen to their passions that they might execute better on them. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6174.14s)]
*  It's weird. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6180.14s)]
*  I'm allergic to doing anything that I don't enjoy in life. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6181.14s)]
*  I fucking hate it, but I can work endlessly on the things that I really love. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6184.860000000001s)]
*  It doesn't even feel like work. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6189.46s)]
*  Get lost in it. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6190.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6191.700000000001s)]
*  It's phenomenal. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6192.700000000001s)]
*  I get lost in it. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6193.700000000001s)]
*  I get lost just sitting there writing my name a hundred fucking times like graffiti, just [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6195.26s)]
*  writing Baklava a million times in 20 different ways. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6198.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6201.66s)]
*  Just doodling. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6202.66s)]
*  I love to paint. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6203.66s)]
*  I just need things to get lost in. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6204.66s)]
*  I need visual stimulation, oratory stimulation, oral stimulation, all that. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6207.0199999999995s)]
*  What was your tag when you were graffiti? [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6214.94s)]
*  Skunt. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6217.7s)]
*  What is skunt? [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6218.7s)]
*  It's a Guyanese word that you call somebody. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6220.94s)]
*  It's a bad thing. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6224.7s)]
*  That's funny. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6225.7s)]
*  And then I wrote action. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6226.7s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6227.7s)]
*  Starting in 04. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6228.7s)]
*  Are any of your tags still up? [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6229.7s)]
*  Do you have some? [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6231.7s)]
*  There's some things here and there. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6233.7s)]
*  You gotta look close. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6236.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6237.179999999999s)]
*  We'll go outside right now and catch some tags. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6238.179999999999s)]
*  No way. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6240.62s)]
*  If you want, you got some paint? [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6241.62s)]
*  Let's do it. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6242.62s)]
*  Yeah, that early graffiti scene is very interesting. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6243.62s)]
*  Did you ever have iconic tags that you really wanted, spots you really wanted to... [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6246.62s)]
*  Lock up? [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6251.02s)]
*  Yeah, the Hell's Gate Bridge. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6252.02s)]
*  You know that bridge? [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6253.9s)]
*  When you're driving on the fucking, going to the Bronx, you're getting on the Triborough [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6255.1s)]
*  Bridge, you look to the right, and those train tracks on the right side, you know them? [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6260.9800000000005s)]
*  And then there's these big pillars within, and they got it. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6265.66s)]
*  It's like you need to wear a harness. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6268.9800000000005s)]
*  Oh, this is... [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6270.78s)]
*  Yeah, but I wasn't going to fucking do all that, but that's something I always wanted. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6271.78s)]
*  I want to have a tag on every single street in movies. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6275.06s)]
*  Like Rocky. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6279.66s)]
*  Oh shit, if you... [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6280.66s)]
*  A famous graffiti writer's father made Rocky, so this graffiti writer's tags were all in [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6282.66s)]
*  every fucking part of the movie. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6289.98s)]
*  I love looking at shit like that. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6292.7s)]
*  I love catching something like that, reading the street. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6294.0199999999995s)]
*  Did you ever tag that area in Long Island City? [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6298.06s)]
*  Now they tore it down, but it's iconic. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6300.9s)]
*  Oh yeah, that was probably... [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6302.94s)]
*  Cloud points? [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6303.94s)]

*  Oh no, wait, that used to be called... [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6308.379999999999s)]
*  Something else. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6314.0199999999995s)]
*  It wasn't called Five Points. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6315.0199999999995s)]
*  Fucking some other shit. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6316.0199999999995s)]

*  That's where I... [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6322.66s)]
*  Man, that used to be a fucking raw spot. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6323.66s)]
*  I forgot the name of it before that, damn. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6325.78s)]
*  What happened to Hunts Point? [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6328.58s)]

*  Hunts Point was like... [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6341.179999999999s)]
*  I feel like Hunts Point was... [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6342.94s)]
*  That was the runway. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6344.9s)]

*  So they had Spick and Spanish and then they had the Black Israelites podcast. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6663.58s)]
*  So podcasting and live streaming, what is popular right now, existed with public access. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6669.78s)]
*  You could call in in real time and just start arguing with the people you are watching on [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6674.86s)]
*  TV and they would tell you to be like, can you turn down your TV because it's coming [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6679.5s)]

*  All right, action. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6807.74s)]
*  Before you get out of here. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6808.74s)]
*  They would have saluted you, honestly. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6809.74s)]

*  You wasn't popping off. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6819.66s)]
*  I just have a really quick question. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6820.78s)]
*  What was it like touring with Eminem in Australia with all the rest of those guys? [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6822.78s)]

*  Insane, right? [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6828.42s)]
*  It was insane. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6829.42s)]
*  It was me, Kendrick, J. Cole, and Eminem. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6830.42s)]
*  Holy crazy. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6832.82s)]
*  And this was like before everyone really popped off like that. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6833.82s)]
*  I didn't even have an album out, but I had the same manager, Paul Rosenberg, as em, so [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6837.139999999999s)]
*  they brought me along. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6841.86s)]
*  I performed in front of 35,000 people in South Africa with him. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6843.94s)]
*  55,000 in Johannesburg, 35,000 in Cape Town. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6848.5s)]
*  Wow. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6852.22s)]
*  What do you learn from performing for something that big, like, that you didn't know before? [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6853.22s)]
*  You need fucking, you need all kinds of doodads on the stage. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6858.42s)]
*  You need fire. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6861.26s)]
*  You need pyrotechnics to take over, because it's just you standing there. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6862.26s)]
*  You need a little bit more. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6865.900000000001s)]
*  You need to fill the room. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6867.62s)]
*  You need music. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6869.38s)]
*  I had one goddamn DJ up there with music that wasn't mixed. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6870.38s)]
*  It was a shit show. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6873.7s)]
*  But it was fun. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6875.18s)]
*  Did you get to hang with the guys? [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6877.139999999999s)]

*  And so just like tour bus shit? [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6880.82s)]
*  Nah, it wasn't really tour bus shit. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6882.139999999999s)]
*  This was more like everyone had their own space, but at the venues you see everybody. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6884.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6888.34s)]
*  And what were the convos like backstage with Kendrick and those guys? [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6889.34s)]
*  These guys are very normal guys, you know what I'm saying? [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6894.46s)]
*  I can't really pinpoint conversations. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6898.74s)]
*  Everyone just talks shit. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6900.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6902.5s)]

*  You have to be summoned to meet him. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6910.38s)]
*  So he asked for me. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6912.42s)]
*  They brought me. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6913.62s)]

*  His back is to me. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6919.34s)]
*  He turns his head slightly. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6921.7s)]
*  The fucking shine of the light just tickles his cheek. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6924.3s)]
*  All you see is a side profile. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6929.5s)]
*  I thought he was going to make a full turn. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6930.74s)]
*  He just went back that way. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6932.74s)]
*  And then I went and said, what's up? [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6934.74s)]
*  And it was just normal. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6935.74s)]
*  And he made me a plate. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6936.74s)]
*  Fixed me a plate of food. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6939.7s)]

*  Okay. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6953.5s)]
*  But this wasn't a foot. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6954.5s)]
*  It's this. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6955.5s)]
*  Hug. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6956.5s)]
*  The slap hug. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6957.5s)]
*  But the slap was strong. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6959.5s)]
*  It was a connection. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6961.7s)]
*  And then the hug was even stronger. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6963.22s)]
*  Gable grip. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6964.7s)]
*  Fan of your work? [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6965.7s)]
*  I would say. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6968.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6969.98s)]
*  I would say. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6970.98s)]
*  I mean, that's why you're there, right? [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6971.98s)]
*  I would say so. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6972.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6973.98s)]
*  Okay. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6974.98s)]
*  Before you leave, we have something for you. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6975.98s)]
*  I know you've been trying to be a skinny shredded motherfucker. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6976.98s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6980.0199999999995s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6981.0199999999995s)]
*  We have an omakase for you. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6982.5s)]
*  Oh shit. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6985.099999999999s)]
*  But it is a chocolate chip cookie omakase. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6986.099999999999s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6988.099999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6989.099999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6990.099999999999s)]
*  Of course. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6991.54s)]
*  Now listen, we have what we think might be seven of the best chocolate chip cookies. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6992.54s)]
*  Wow. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6997.620000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6998.620000000001s)]
*  One or two had to be made. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=6999.620000000001s)]
*  One is Milton Abel Jr.'s chocolate chip cookie. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7002.9400000000005s)]
*  This has been- [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7008.06s)]
*  Bless that man. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7009.06s)]
*  This has been made. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7010.06s)]
*  Milton Abel Jr. is a fucking tremendous man. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7011.06s)]
*  Tell us. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7013.820000000001s)]
*  Tell us. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7014.820000000001s)]
*  Milton Abel Jr. is one of the best bakers I've ever met. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7015.82s)]
*  Met him in Copenhagen. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7021.299999999999s)]
*  And, you know, he used to work at the French Laundry. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7022.299999999999s)]
*  He worked- [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7025.82s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7026.82s)]
*  And over here, in Copenhagen, he worked at Noma. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7027.82s)]
*  He worked at a bunch of different places. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7030.74s)]
*  Noma is the number one restaurant in the world or whatever. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7032.0199999999995s)]
*  Right now, yeah. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7034.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7035.54s)]
*  And he worked at a bunch of different places, but he opened a spot over there. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7036.54s)]
*  And the man just is magical with the baking. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7040.42s)]
*  Okay. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7043.46s)]
*  So we're gonna do one of each. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7044.46s)]
*  Also, what is your choice of milk? [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7045.78s)]
*  We have all of the milk. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7047.78s)]
*  Skim. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7049.78s)]
*  Ooh. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7050.78s)]
*  Cold. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7051.78s)]
*  Ooh. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7052.78s)]
*  Well, cold, yeah. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7053.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7054.78s)]
*  And then let's do one of each cookie and then we can all- [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7055.78s)]
*  All in one round? [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7057.78s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7058.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7059.78s)]
*  You know why you do cold skim? [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7060.78s)]
*  Why skim? [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7061.78s)]
*  Because the cream affects the cookie. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7062.78s)]
*  If you do a whole milk, the creaminess of the milk could make the cookie better. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7064.66s)]
*  So you don't get a true taste. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7070.02s)]
*  You don't get a true taste of the cookie. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7071.02s)]
*  What we're doing is we're still getting some lactic cold, but the full taste of the cookie. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7073.42s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7078.18s)]
*  And also, you know, I don't really need to dunk. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7079.18s)]
*  It's more of a wash with the milk. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7081.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7083.58s)]
*  It's a milk wash. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7084.58s)]
*  I agree with that. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7085.58s)]
*  Do you think that is the best pairing for the chocolate chip cookie? [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7086.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7090.42s)]
*  Or is this just a cultural thing that we just have agreed to? [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7091.42s)]
*  Chai is good. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7094.46s)]
*  Chai is good, yeah. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7095.46s)]
*  Chai biscuits will do, but- [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7096.46s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7097.46s)]
*  Chai and chocolate cookies or coffee and chocolate chip cookie is really good. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7098.46s)]
*  The reason I knew you were hanging with Russ is because I went to go get a cookie from [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7104.34s)]
*  a place and the guy who's the chef there, he had worked on some stuff with Russ. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7110.1s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, I think they're cooking today. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7117.58s)]
*  Bro, I'm going to invite you guys to the pop-up. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7120.3s)]
*  Crazy? [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7123.900000000001s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7124.900000000001s)]
*  It's ridiculous stuff. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7125.900000000001s)]
*  But he makes a good fucking cookie. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7128.02s)]
*  The butterscotch. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7131.46s)]
*  He sent them over here. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7133.1s)]
*  I didn't realize that you had made that and now it all makes sense. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7134.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7137.02s)]
*  Do you enjoy the process of being in a proper kitchen or do you like being dolo working [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7138.02s)]
*  on your own shit? [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7142.26s)]
*  No, I like being in a proper kitchen also. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7143.26s)]
*  I like all that shit. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7144.62s)]
*  The energy. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7145.62s)]
*  Yeah, because I don't know it all. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7146.62s)]
*  I need to be with people that are better than me and have more experience. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7148.74s)]
*  That's why I only like to be around high level shit because how would I get better if I'm [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7152.26s)]
*  around fucking mediocrity. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7157.66s)]
*  But you enjoy the intensity of the pace. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7159.78s)]
*  I love all that shit. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7163.06s)]
*  I like pressure. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7164.18s)]
*  I like balls to the wall. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7165.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7167.26s)]
*  And do you like the, I guess, systems of running an entire restaurant or do you want to only [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7168.26s)]
*  focus on the kitchen? [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7172.1s)]
*  You have to be conscious of it all, bro. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7174.740000000001s)]
*  That's where that money, the money's in the bar, the money's in the minutia and the little [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7177.46s)]
*  details things. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7182.58s)]
*  The food usually, the bar is what dictates the ability of the kitchen to do what they [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7183.58s)]
*  want. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7189.22s)]
*  And real money at the bar, you could get the good ingredients. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7190.26s)]
*  Yeah, whatever the fuck you want. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7192.3s)]
*  It's all a show. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7194.14s)]
*  Where's your restaurant? [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7195.14s)]
*  I'm working, man. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7196.14s)]
*  I'm working on it right now. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7197.14s)]
*  There's some things in the works. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7198.62s)]
*  Like, yeah, I don't like to put it out in the air until it's real. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7200.66s)]
*  What are some restaurant red flags? [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7203.5s)]
*  If you sit down at a restaurant and you see something, how do you know it's going to be [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7204.5s)]
*  not as good as people tell you? [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7207.38s)]
*  Fuck, man. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7210.06s)]
*  I really don't like to shit on places, so I don't want to give that up. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7216.9s)]
*  I just know. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7221.54s)]
*  You just know. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7222.94s)]
*  Who the fuck is telling you it's good is usually a telltale sign of whether it's going to be [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7225.139999999999s)]
*  good or not. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7230.7s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7231.7s)]
*  Yeah, if you don't trust their opinion. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7232.7s)]
*  Who that info is coming from. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7233.7s)]
*  Like yo, if I know your pal, it's garbage. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7235.66s)]
*  And you're telling me this is great, oh man. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7237.7s)]
*  Do you think Michelin star restaurants are sometimes overhyped? [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7240.42s)]
*  Of course. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7242.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7243.9s)]
*  Of course. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7244.9s)]
*  I think that they're looking for things that are new and inventive. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7245.9s)]
*  And it's like, just like music. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7248.66s)]
*  It's a lot of shit that just keeps getting redone in movies. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7251.46s)]
*  So when someone does something new and fresh and crazy, give them the fucking star. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7255.54s)]

*  Why not? [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7260.94s)]
*  Why you think they're a little too traditional about it? [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7261.94s)]
*  I don't really know what they look for. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7264.339999999999s)]
*  I believe that's- [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7267.5s)]

*  Yeah, there it is. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7271.54s)]
*  It's usually some fucking snooty bullshit. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7272.54s)]
*  That's why. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7274.9s)]

*  You know, it's not Michelin. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7279.7s)]

*  Which one? [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7293.5s)]

*  Will you give a restaurant extra credit for being able to serve more people at the same [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7323.660000000001s)]
*  quality? [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7330.46s)]
*  In other words, like 100- [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7331.46s)]
*  That's not easy. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7332.46s)]
*  ... consistency and level at that. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7333.9s)]
*  Yeah, but I also talked to a chef who said that he fucking, that's actually like trash. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7335.9s)]
*  What you mean? [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7340.86s)]
*  To be able to just do the same thing over and over again, the same every day is kind [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7342.58s)]
*  of like sad also. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7346.9800000000005s)]
*  Break that down. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7349.62s)]
*  Yeah, I saw that on one of your vlogs. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7350.62s)]
*  It recently was out. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7351.62s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7352.62s)]
*  And that dude has the- [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7353.62s)]
*  Oh, it's sad that that's- [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7354.62s)]
*  Noma and then Tablet, which is this dude Bruno Verju. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7355.62s)]
*  He just became a chef at 52 or 56. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7358.5s)]
*  He was a food critic before that, and he makes different food every day. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7362.22s)]
*  It's always dependent on what's the freshest from the farm. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7367.14s)]
*  And then that dictates his menu. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7371.740000000001s)]
*  He thinks that it's sad to have brilliant young creatives doing the same thing every [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7375.34s)]
*  day. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7381.66s)]
*  The restriction. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7383.26s)]
*  The restriction. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7384.26s)]
*  There's a removal of the artistry. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7385.26s)]
*  Yeah, you lose. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7386.26s)]
*  It's like you lose language. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7387.9400000000005s)]
*  You lose the ability to express yourself. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7389.86s)]
*  I agree with that artistically. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7394.9s)]
*  You just want to be able to flow and do whatever. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7396.66s)]
*  But the difficulty required in recreating something to satisfy me the second, third, [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7398.66s)]
*  or fifth time. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7405.54s)]
*  If I go have a steak at Rawls Rules, and I tell my friends, hey, we got to go to Rawls [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7406.54s)]
*  and get the steak, I want to know that that shit is going to taste like the last time [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7410.9s)]
*  I went because I just put my name on it. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7414.38s)]
*  For sure. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7415.9s)]
*  At this point with Lugers, Lugers is phenomenal, but I judge it like, oh, tonight was a really [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7417.54s)]
*  good night. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7422.54s)]
*  Tonight was a good one at Lugers. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7423.54s)]
*  Sometimes it's just so, it's not as good as the last time. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7426.42s)]
*  But sometimes it's fucking unheard of, and you can't even judge it. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7432.48s)]
*  Even with Lugers, I remember Lugers getting all that shit. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7436.14s)]
*  Remember there was a guy, and it's like, yo. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7439.74s)]
*  No, it's because that fucking guy is a cocksucker. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7441.62s)]
*  All he wants to do is talk shit anyway. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7443.58s)]
*  He was up to his fucking, he was like, I'm sick of this shit. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7446.66s)]
*  That's on him. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7450.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7451.42s)]
*  I feel him though. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7452.42s)]
*  What he's looking for is some new inventive shit. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7453.42s)]
*  But don't go to Lugers, don't go there for that. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7456.66s)]
*  You know you're not getting that there. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7458.82s)]
*  This is traditional steakhouse, dudes are going there after work in their work attire, [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7460.219999999999s)]

*  thing and it's like, dude, this is- [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7469.38s)]
*  I was there on Thanksgiving. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7471.139999999999s)]
*  It was only Asian people in there. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7473.54s)]
*  It was literally only Asian people in there and us. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7475.98s)]
*  I've never seen that before. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7479.42s)]
*  But that's what's happening now, so the expectation is like, you're going to go to this exquisite [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7480.78s)]
*  fine dining. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7484.3s)]

*  I don't want a guy fucking shaking it and it's all delicious. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7499.26s)]
*  The sound of the shaking is all that. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7501.46s)]
*  I don't want it to be delicious. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=7502.58s)]

*  Kao Kang. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8070.5s)]
*  Bro, fucking stupid shit. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8072.5s)]
*  Really unheard of flavors. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8075.5s)]
*  It's like you've never eaten Thai food before. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8079.5s)]
*  Why is there such good flavor from that region? [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8081.5s)]
*  Why is Thai food and what's so specific about that? [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8083.5s)]
*  Vietnamese food even? [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8086.5s)]
*  It's because they power pack five or six different flavor profiles into every dish. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8087.5s)]
*  Sweet, sour, salty, fucking spicy umami. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8092.5s)]
*  It's in every dish. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8095.5s)]
*  Indians love Thai food. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8098.5s)]
*  Oh yeah, because Singaporeans too. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8099.5s)]
*  I don't know if they're similar people. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8101.5s)]
*  It's because it's that Pan Asia. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8102.5s)]
*  It's like all that area where they use 40 different things in one dish. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8104.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8110.5s)]
*  You know? [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8111.5s)]
*  I went to Bangalore. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8112.5s)]
*  Every place you went to, like the pizza place, barbecue chicken pizza, jalapenos on it. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8113.5s)]
*  They do everything a little Indian. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8117.5s)]
*  Thai food, they don't. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8119.5s)]
*  We let that sit. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8120.5s)]
*  It was a fascinating thing to see. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8121.5s)]
*  I like altering pizza. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8123.5s)]
*  I don't want it to just be like an Italian pizza with all these beautiful Italian products. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8126.5s)]
*  Cool. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8131.5s)]
*  But we could play and fucking have fun. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8132.5s)]
*  There's room for both. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8133.5s)]
*  Yeah, I like pineapple and fucking shit on pizza. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8134.5s)]
*  I like all that stuff. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8136.5s)]
*  Give it to me. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8137.5s)]
*  Yo, that sandwich you made. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8138.5s)]
*  Sorry, but the people get upset about pineapple on pizza act like there's no regular pizza [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8140.5s)]
*  places they could just go to. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8145.5s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8147.5s)]
*  Try it. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8148.5s)]
*  If you had it the right way where it's not like some pineapple, some ham, and stuff, [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8149.5s)]
*  it's just done right. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8154.5s)]
*  But that's some Italian shit where it's like they've spent so long curating and crafting [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8155.5s)]
*  their cuisine. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8160.5s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8161.5s)]
*  And if we do anything to it, they're just like, no, no, we did all the things. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8162.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8165.5s)]
*  We tried it. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8166.5s)]
*  We did this already. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8167.5s)]
*  We tried pineapple. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8168.5s)]
*  It didn't hit. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8169.5s)]
*  It's like insulting to them that we would think we could add on to it, which I get a [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8170.5s)]
*  little bit. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8174.7s)]
*  They got a few thousand years. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8175.7s)]
*  Yeah, but all kinds of new shit comes out. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8177.86s)]
*  There's no new product that's coming fresh out of Italy that's being used. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8180.38s)]
*  That's what they say about Italy right now. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8184.9s)]
*  It's like they're stuck in the past. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8186.34s)]
*  We love our culture so much that it's almost hard to break free from it. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8188.98s)]
*  It's hard to be a new chef doing something novel because you get criticized that you're [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8193.02s)]
*  not respecting the way the food should be made. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8197.3s)]
*  You're right. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8200.46s)]
*  Whatever. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8201.46s)]
*  I talked to these young chefs in Rome that told me that their restaurant is really like [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8202.46s)]
*  out there and amazing. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8205.939999999999s)]
*  They use like the soul of that type of thing, but they modernized it and people like- [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8207.26s)]
*  Like what are you doing? [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8213.34s)]
*  They're being shunned. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8214.34s)]
*  But you know what? [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8215.34s)]
*  They gotta do that. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8216.34s)]
*  Like that's the way that you make a name for yourself. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8217.5s)]
*  I'm looking at dudes like Massimo Battuta, like the dude who just like, sure that's Italian [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8219.54s)]
*  food, but is it? [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8225.54s)]
*  Like, the fuck is that? [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8226.54s)]
*  He's like painting, but that's not traditional. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8229.460000000001s)]
*  What is his- [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8232.02s)]
*  His food, like it's all artful things on a plate. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8233.02s)]
*  Like it just looks gorgeous. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8235.94s)]
*  But at the root of it, it's traditional cooking, but he just makes it look better. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8237.58s)]
*  So people, I guess they get mad at him for making something that's would traditionally [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8243.18s)]
*  be one shape of pasta and this sauce. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8248.42s)]
*  It has to be this or else it's not that. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8251.26s)]
*  And he does it differently. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8253.34s)]
*  But that's how you become a legend. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8256.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8257.62s)]
*  Fucking think out the box and break through. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8258.62s)]
*  Stop doing the same shit as everyone. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8260.78s)]
*  All right, last question before we wrap. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8262.220000000001s)]
*  You made a sandwich in one of your videos. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8266.56s)]
*  It's a chicken cutlet, sesame seeds. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8269.220000000001s)]
*  It looked like you had some fried bananas on there. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8272.78s)]
*  Was it bananas or plantains? [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8275.820000000002s)]
*  This is a long time. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8277.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, the fried maduro, like the sweet plantain. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8278.5s)]
*  And then chocolate ice cream. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8281.820000000002s)]
*  Now, it sounds crazy, which is why I clicked the video, but the explanation was interesting. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8283.980000000001s)]
*  It was, and it was what we were saying earlier, back to your childhood, it was like, what [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8291.980000000001s)]
*  did you say I want? [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8295.54s)]
*  Wendy's spicy chicken sandwich and a frosty. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8296.78s)]
*  So when you're eating that together, that's what your mouth is going through, right? [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8299.5s)]
*  Now here's my question about it. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8304.54s)]
*  Are you letting the chicken cutlet cool before you throw that ice cream on? [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8306.5s)]
*  No. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8311.14s)]
*  So the whole shit is just melting as you eat it? [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8312.14s)]
*  Well, you put a big enough scoop there. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8313.86s)]
*  I've seen this recreated recently and it looked really good. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8315.66s)]
*  There's a way to make it really, there's a way to make it better, but yeah, it's fucking [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8320.02s)]
*  messy. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8324.7s)]
*  It's gonna be messy. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8325.7s)]
*  So you just accept it. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8326.7s)]
*  Yeah, you accept what you're eating. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8327.7s)]
*  You know that this is not right and you fucking do it anyway. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8328.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8331.900000000001s)]
*  I mean, that looked crazy. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8332.900000000001s)]
*  I'm not gonna lie. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8333.900000000001s)]
*  It's a good one, man. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8334.900000000001s)]
*  Well, you just go get a spicy chicken sandwich and a frosty and it'll be the same thing. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8335.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8339.7s)]
*  You heard it here first. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8340.7s)]
*  Action Bronson, everybody. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8341.7s)]
*  Thank you, everyone. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8342.7s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJHnDIEvkg&t=8343.7s)]
