**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg)
*  What's up, everybody? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to Flagrant. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=0.9s)]
*  And today we have one of my favorites, man. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2.1s)]
*  We got Adam Rowe back. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4.7s)]
*  Oh, that was cool. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5.7s)]
*  We got it. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6.84s)]
*  Bam, bam, bam. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  And listen, we heard you're in town. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=8.44s)]
*  We want you to come on the pod naturally. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=9.88s)]
*  But there are some things that we need to get to the bottom [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=11.58s)]
*  to that are happening in Great Britain right now. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=14.38s)]
*  OK. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=17.580000000000002s)]
*  OK? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=18.38s)]
*  It seems like there's two problems [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=19.68s)]
*  that could solve one another. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=20.68s)]
*  There's like a couple British girls [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=21.86s)]
*  that are trying to like, the most people in a day. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=23.36s)]
*  And then there's like, gang-r-ing. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=25.86s)]
*  I'm working. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=28.26s)]
*  You see what he's going through? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=29.26s)]
*  And I just feel. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=33.86s)]
*  You know if you'd have paused him before he brought [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=35.260000000000005s)]
*  either of those up? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=37.86s)]
*  I knew we'd go Bonnie Blue, Lilly Phillips, and Groom and Gang. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=39.04s)]
*  I'm like, Groom and Gang. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=42.74s)]
*  So what I'm saying is if it's like, there's a problem, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=44.14s)]
*  and then there's a solution, but it just [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=47.08s)]
*  seems like we can't connect them. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=48.58s)]
*  And this is where you need that American ingenuity. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=49.88s)]
*  I'm here to let Bonnie Blue and what's the other one's name? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=52.040000000000006s)]
*  Lilly Phillips. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=54.64s)]
*  Lilly Phillips. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=55.44s)]
*  No, there's a what? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=56.24s)]
*  Sorry, I thought you were talking about the gamer. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=57.7s)]
*  I was like, we don't know their name. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=59.44s)]
*  That's scary. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=61.44s)]
*  Anyway, but the Groom and Gangs, right? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=62.24s)]
*  I feel like we could, you know, they don't have to do it anymore. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=65.62s)]
*  They could just get online. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=69.52s)]
*  I think you're forgetting what we spoke about last time I was here. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=70.66s)]
*  First thing, you need to stop making it sound so cool. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=72.48s)]
*  What is that? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=73.86s)]
*  Groom and Gangs is just, it has a little ring to it, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=75.06s)]
*  like make it sound worse than that. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=76.86s)]
*  That doesn't sound, it makes them sound like fucking [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=79.26s)]
*  hairdressers. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=81.3s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=82.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=82.9s)]
*  Make it sound way worse. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=83.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=85.16s)]
*  What is the grooming part? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=86.58s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=87.72s)]
*  So like, I mean, it's going to make me sound like I'm an expert on it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=88.82s)]
*  But like, grooming someone, like it's when like a teacher is like [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=91.02s)]
*  wanting to fuck one of their students. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=96.6s)]
*  They like groom them like, hey, it wouldn't be too bad if we fucked. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=98.0s)]
*  I've heard of that. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=101.1s)]
*  And like, that's what these gangs are accused of doing. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=102.2s)]
*  So they would groom girls. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=104.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=107.88s)]
*  And then wait until they're legal and then have sex with them. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=108.88s)]
*  I've got to be honest with you. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=111.48s)]
*  I think, so what you're talking about is that- [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=112.78s)]
*  I don't know what I'm talking about. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=115.56s)]
*  I just saw one headline. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=116.86s)]
*  So where you're getting these headlines from is like the Daily Mail and shit. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=118.2s)]
*  So like this is the day that- [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=121.14s)]
*  Gang and gang bangs in the same place. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  And then for whatever reason, we can't put those together. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=124.0s)]
*  It's rhetoric pushed by like right wing media. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=126.88000000000001s)]
*  It were like, we want to sort of focus on immigration. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=130.14000000000001s)]
*  So like, there's a really, really good interview from years ago [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=133.22s)]
*  where there's a political commentator from the UK called Akala. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=138.02s)]
*  And he's- [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=141.08s)]
*  I know that guy, he raps too. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=141.86s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=143.02s)]
*  And he's talking on like, there's like a panel. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=143.94s)]
*  It's like a panel in front of an audience talking about racism [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=146.04s)]
*  and all that sort of stuff. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=149.33999999999997s)]
*  And he goes, the interesting thing is when a Pakistani guy, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=150.44s)]
*  someone or a grooming gang who are from Pakistan originally, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=153.32s)]
*  someone, their racial identity and the fact that they're an immigrant [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=157.11999999999998s)]
*  is put forward as like the primary reason for them committing the atrocity. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=161.06s)]
*  Whereas like when Jimmy Saddle, who's like a really famous person, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=164.89999999999998s)]
*  who's a white guy from Stoke, when he does it, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=167.95999999999998s)]
*  it's not like it's because he's from Stoke. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=170.2s)]
*  Whereas like the grooming gang is like, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=172.58s)]
*  well they're from Pakistan, of course they're doing it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=173.98s)]
*  But we assume it's because he's British, that's why he does it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=175.38s)]
*  Isn't that what the rest of the world goes? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=179.62s)]
*  They're like, yeah, this is what they do. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=181.02s)]
*  They come and pick them. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=182.2s)]
*  Also, the Pakistani guys- [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=183.46s)]
*  They're giving us P-N-O-S, it's like, we're the go to that. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=184.56s)]
*  You've got the top two of all time. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=187.34s)]
*  You've got Hardwick Kelly and Michael Jackson. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=189.24s)]
*  And Epstein. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=191.44s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=192.24s)]
*  You guys fell off, dude. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=193.34s)]
*  You had a great run. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=194.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=196.64s)]
*  That's what America is. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=197.44s)]
*  America does everything we do and you just take it to one more level. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=198.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=201.64s)]
*  You always see what we're doing and then it's like, ah. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=202.38s)]
*  So you heard what Adam Rose said, step it up, ladies. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=205.12s)]
*  2,000 guys in a day. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=208.42000000000002s)]
*  And that's the thing with this. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=210.16s)]
*  You're saying like, why can't we just marry these two? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=211.7s)]
*  You're forgetting that in the UK, our racism [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=213.4s)]
*  is directed towards Pakistani guys and people from South Asia [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=216.4s)]
*  rather than anyone else. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=220.16s)]
*  Than who? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=222.04s)]
*  Mexicans and black people. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=223.04s)]
*  That's your one, isn't it? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=224.64000000000001s)]
*  Is it? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=225.48000000000002s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=225.98000000000002s)]
*  I think we- [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=226.78s)]
*  I've seen the clips. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=227.3s)]
*  I think- [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=228.04s)]
*  I've seen the clips. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=228.84s)]
*  Hey, we were punching Asians for a little bit. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=231.67999999999998s)]
*  Did you try diversify? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=233.57999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, but you stopped off for a couple of weeks. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=234.77999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, we did that because they were fucking, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=236.38s)]
*  they would fight back. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=237.67999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=238.48s)]
*  It was scary. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=239.48s)]
*  It was scary. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=240.32s)]
*  OK, so this is, again, a lot of the news [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=243.42s)]
*  that we get from Great Britain is like, what, Elon tweets? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=248.2s)]
*  You know, and then- [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=249.0s)]

*  In Liverpool or in Manchester, it was like, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=540.4599999999999s)]
*  you couldn't understand a word. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=542.4s)]
*  But also, so before, because I know where the story's going. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=543.9s)]
*  Let me just contextualize this. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=546.4s)]
*  So that show was the day after you did our podcast. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=548.1s)]
*  And you come to our podcast and you're in the studio [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=552.6s)]
*  with the whole crew of yours. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=555.0s)]
*  And then you go to me, you want to come to the show tomorrow? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=556.6400000000001s)]
*  I was like, yeah, we'll come down. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=558.5400000000001s)]
*  Me, Jack, who's the photographer, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=559.94s)]
*  also like one of my best mates. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=562.24s)]
*  Stee, who's like our podcast admin guy. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=563.8800000000001s)]
*  And then Carl, who's like my best mate, lead producer. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=566.6800000000001s)]
*  So the four of us were like, we'll come down to the show. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=569.5600000000001s)]
*  But that's all I knew. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=571.5600000000001s)]
*  And then like at the time, I'm sort of like [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=572.86s)]
*  half going through a breakup. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=574.46s)]
*  Like it had been done, but I hadn't spoke to my dad [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=575.6600000000001s)]
*  for a while. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=577.96s)]
*  Like not that I hadn't spoke to him, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=579.0s)]
*  but like I hadn't seen him. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=579.96s)]
*  So the next day I text me, I was like, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=581.38s)]
*  you want to go out for lunch? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=583.26s)]
*  Should we go out for lunch tomorrow? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=584.28s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, let's go. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=585.3199999999999s)]
*  And he's like, what are you up to tonight? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=586.52s)]
*  I was like, oh, I'm just going to Manchester [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=587.56s)]
*  to watch Schultes in town and like going to go [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=589.16s)]
*  and see the show. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=591.66s)]
*  And me dad was like, we haven't had a pint for ages. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=592.76s)]
*  We're going to have a pint. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=594.4s)]
*  So I went and had 10 pints of Guinness with my dad. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=595.6999999999999s)]
*  And then on the way to Manchester, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=599.8s)]
*  you text me and say, how long are you doing? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=601.2399999999999s)]
*  Like how long do you want to do tonight? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=603.9399999999999s)]
*  Oh, I thought you knew that I was inviting you to do a spot. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=605.38s)]
*  Like you're very casual with stuff like this. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=609.8s)]
*  In your head you're like, oh, I've got a friend [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=611.9s)]
*  who lives down the road. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=613.8s)]
*  Of course he's going to do a set. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=614.84s)]
*  In my head I'm like, I'm just going to watch. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=616.94s)]
*  You've got two openers with you already. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=618.6s)]
*  That's probably enough for you. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=620.1s)]
*  I'm just going to watch. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=621.34s)]
*  I'm having a night in the theatre watching a friend of mine. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=622.54s)]
*  So I'm in the car and Carl's driving us. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=625.1800000000001s)]
*  And I'm like fucking, I'm like, I was like, oh shit. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=627.62s)]
*  I was like, well, I'm not doing the show. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=630.02s)]
*  So I was like, I'll do it. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=632.32s)]
*  And I turn up to Manchester and Tanya goes, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=633.32s)]
*  can I get you anything? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=636.22s)]
*  And I was like, I need four bottles of water. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=637.42s)]
*  And then I walk in the dressing room. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=638.9399999999999s)]
*  And you're all fucking meditating. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=643.5799999999999s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=645.62s)]
*  We were asleep. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=646.42s)]
*  Oh, we were asleep. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=647.2199999999999s)]
*  Ha! [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=648.02s)]
*  So I'm like, oh, god. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=648.8199999999999s)]
*  So I expect that was. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=653.06s)]
*  Meditating. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=654.06s)]
*  I'm jet lagged. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=655.06s)]
*  Dude, that's so funny. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=658.06s)]
*  Yeah, we turned all the lights out. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=659.36s)]
*  We put like the thing down. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=660.8s)]
*  And then we all tried to take a nap. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=662.36s)]
*  And then Adam comes in, 10 kiddos teet. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=663.9s)]
*  Like, what's up, lads? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=666.74s)]
*  What's up, lads? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=667.96s)]
*  So I'm like, right, I really need to sort my head out here. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=670.4000000000001s)]
*  But then, like, whenever I'm talking to you guys, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=673.0s)]
*  or if I'm on stage in the States, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=675.7s)]
*  my accent softens quite a bit. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=677.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=679.24s)]
*  This is softening. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=680.0400000000001s)]
*  This is soft. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=680.84s)]
*  He's doing an American accent. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=681.6400000000001s)]
*  He's articulating. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=682.6400000000001s)]
*  I honestly think I sound like Jay-Z right now. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=684.24s)]
*  I'm trying to do this. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=686.72s)]
*  I thought I'd be coached. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=689.08s)]
*  This shit is getting on my nerves. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=690.12s)]
*  This is how you talk to the police. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=693.0200000000001s)]
*  Please. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=694.38s)]
*  Hello, gunkas. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=695.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=696.6800000000001s)]
*  But in Liverpool and Manchester especially, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=699.02s)]
*  like, for the crowd, I know I can just... [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=701.02s)]
*  Just lay in. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=703.22s)]
*  I can just let go. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=704.0600000000001s)]
*  So, like, what would normally take me, you know, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=705.72s)]
*  20 minutes to do out here? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=708.5s)]
*  I could probably do in 10 in Manchester. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=710.16s)]
*  So I go on and I'm doing my set. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=712.34s)]
*  And I don't know whether you want to tell the rest of the story, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=714.64s)]
*  but I have a joke in my set at the time about a girl... [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=716.38s)]
*  I'm breaking up with her and I'm happy to see her go, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=723.62s)]
*  so she's trying to upset me. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=725.6999999999999s)]
*  And she said, while we were together, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=727.1999999999999s)]
*  I've faked, like, half of my orgasms. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=729.36s)]
*  And I'm like, that's a compliment. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=731.64s)]
*  Like, half fucking... [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=734.1999999999999s)]
*  That's a whole word every two bars. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=735.8399999999999s)]
*  Like, it's fucking insane. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=737.14s)]
*  But Mark's got a similar bit about, like... [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=738.5999999999999s)]
*  Proving that I'm good at sex. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=741.8399999999999s)]
*  Like, why I think I'm good at sex. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=743.04s)]
*  And he went on straight after me because he couldn't understand [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=744.24s)]
*  the word I was saying. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=746.18s)]
*  He does that joke in the whole room. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=747.38s)]
*  He's like, that last guy just did that. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=748.8199999999999s)]
*  See? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=750.54s)]
*  He fucking set me up. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=753.9399999999999s)]
*  The beginning of the set, I'm doing... [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=755.9399999999999s)]
*  I'm like, this is fun. This is a good show. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=757.5s)]
*  In case any of you guys only speak English, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=759.54s)]
*  I'll do this version of the joke. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=761.54s)]
*  And I get to the middle of it and that joke just gets nothing. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=764.5799999999999s)]
*  And I was like, huh. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=766.78s)]
*  And then I'm thinking in my head, like, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=768.28s)]
*  did I forget the setup? Did I fucked up the joke? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=769.52s)]
*  And then I'm doing the rest of the set thinking, like, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=772.06s)]
*  did I... I don't know any of these jokes. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=774.46s)]
*  It's just 3,000 people going, why is he just still not... [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=776.92s)]
*  So, did you tell him afterwards or something? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=780.56s)]
*  I did briefly. I was like, Marc, you know that bit [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=782.66s)]
*  that confused you in the middle? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=785.1s)]
*  Like, I'd done the same sort of premise before you went on. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=786.86s)]
*  And he'd just come off stage, he was a bit frazzled. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=790.4399999999999s)]
*  And he was like, oh, yeah, yeah, no worries. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=792.4s)]
*  And then before when we got here, like, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=793.9s)]
*  when we were waiting around, he's like, oh, yeah, this. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=795.48s)]
*  And I was like, you didn't really click onto this. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=798.28s)]
*  I had... Go, go, go, go. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=800.38s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=802.28s)]
*  I had no clue. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=803.38s)]
*  I didn't register because I came off stage and he goes, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=804.48s)]
*  oh, yeah, yeah, we have a similar bit. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=805.78s)]
*  And I go, that's awesome, man. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=807.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=808.56s)]
*  I didn't get it. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=809.7199999999999s)]
*  Like, sometimes comics have similar bits, you know, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=810.8199999999999s)]
*  whatever, and I didn't realize that's what you were saying [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=812.0s)]
*  until five minutes ago. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=814.16s)]
*  And I was like, oh. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=815.56s)]
*  Oh, you didn't? Don't we have two shows? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=816.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=818.2399999999999s)]
*  I only did the late show, though. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=819.3399999999999s)]
*  Ah, okay. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=820.4399999999999s)]
*  I was drinking, that's why you did the late show. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=821.54s)]
*  And the first show was amazing, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=823.64s)]
*  and then the second show, that one show just bombs. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=825.2399999999999s)]
*  And I was like, what the fuck? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=827.5799999999999s)]
*  Bro, Marc... [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=829.0799999999999s)]
*  Get calls, man, see you off stage, bro. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=830.18s)]
*  Yeah, shit. Marc was in... [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=831.88s)]
*  Or we were on Vancouver. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=833.78s)]
*  Not the last time, the time before. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=835.18s)]
*  This is legendary, dude. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=836.5799999999999s)]
*  And... [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=837.68s)]
*  Marc had a great bit about Uber, right? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=839.1999999999999s)]
*  I won't tell the bit. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=842.38s)]
*  But, and, you know, he would start the joke [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=843.78s)]
*  by saying, like, we're taking the Uber over here, right? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=847.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=849.4799999999999s)]
*  Just to, like, make it feel really present [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=850.5799999999999s)]
*  and get everybody involved and so relatable. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=852.5799999999999s)]
*  And Marc is telling the joke without realizing that [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=854.4599999999999s)]
*  there is no Uber in Vancouver. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=858.12s)]
*  So... [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=859.42s)]
*  So... [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=860.52s)]
*  So... [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=861.62s)]
*  So... [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=862.7199999999999s)]
*  So... [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=863.8199999999999s)]
*  Because I know how you do it. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=864.9399999999999s)]
*  So I look at him like, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=866.04s)]
*  you did not take a fucking Uber here. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=867.0999999999999s)]
*  Oh, that would kill me, you know, because that... [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=868.9s)]
*  It doesn't just ruin that bit. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=871.5999999999999s)]
*  The whole audience then goes, this guy's full of shit. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=873.0999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he's not even married, okay? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=875.0999999999999s)]
*  He's not even... He doesn't even have a huge dick. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=877.14s)]
*  Okay, that joke wasn't real. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=879.24s)]
*  Oh... [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=880.98s)]
*  Like, I would... [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=882.0799999999999s)]
*  I think I'd have got to the end of that [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=883.18s)]
*  and been like, oh, they don't have Uber here. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=884.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=886.5799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=887.68s)]
*  There's a handful of times... [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=888.78s)]
*  Because I come out here and I'll come and talk to you. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=890.0799999999999s)]
*  You did actually realize on stage. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=891.5799999999999s)]
*  This is how dumb I am. I didn't even realize it. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=893.0799999999999s)]
*  I had to get half of it through the bit [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=895.16s)]
*  that I'm bombing through, and someone goes, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=896.46s)]
*  we don't have Uber. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=898.16s)]
*  Oh, they told you? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=899.26s)]
*  They told us. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=900.36s)]
*  Because I was like, maybe I'll just muscle through it [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=901.46s)]
*  and kind of get them mad or something. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=903.76s)]
*  We'll be over here from Seattle. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=905.06s)]
*  Yeah, that's where it gets fucking long dry. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=906.16s)]
*  Oh, it's so bad. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=910.0s)]
*  Also, guys, show dates. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=911.1s)]
*  First of all, Brea, we already sold out all four shows. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=912.7s)]
*  I'm going to try to get everybody who wants to see the show [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=915.58s)]
*  tickets, though, so we're adding one. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=917.78s)]
*  February 20th, Thursday, we're going to add that show. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=919.78s)]
*  Also, February 27th, 28th, and March 1st, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=922.64s)]
*  I'm going to be in Zanies in Nashville. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=925.3s)]
*  March 14th and 15th, I'm going to be in Tulsa, Oklahoma. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=926.78s)]
*  March 21st and 22nd, Omaha 28th and 29th, Columbus, Ohio. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=929.38s)]
*  And then the April shows are in Tampa. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=933.12s)]
*  The ones that I could not make because of the flu [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=935.42s)]
*  are moved to April 11th and 12th. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=937.32s)]
*  I think tickets are already almost sold out, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=939.22s)]
*  so hurry up and buy those. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=940.82s)]
*  If you bought tickets in January, you're good for now. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=941.92s)]
*  But we're going to add as many shows as we can. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=943.86s)]
*  Love you guys. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=945.5600000000001s)]
*  AkashSingh.com for those dates, and we're [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=946.5600000000001s)]
*  going to add more soon. Thank you. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=947.86s)]
*  Peace. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=948.96s)]
*  I'll Google stuff now before I... [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=949.96s)]
*  Even before a club set over here, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=951.4200000000001s)]
*  if I've got something I'm going to try out, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=952.9200000000001s)]
*  be like, I'm checking this. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=954.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm checking homeless people drink cider. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=956.2s)]
*  Nope. Okay. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=958.4s)]
*  LAUGHTER [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=959.5s)]
*  I do do that when I'm in another country. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=961.6s)]
*  It's never the concept of the joke. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=964.14s)]
*  I'm like, do you know what this word means? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=966.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=967.84s)]
*  You've texted me a couple times in the UK. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=969.0400000000001s)]
*  I remember when you texted me about London, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=971.14s)]
*  you were like, what the fuck is... [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=972.74s)]
*  What are these people? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=974.98s)]
*  I can't get me finger on. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=976.2800000000001s)]
*  And I was like, no one where you are is a Londoner. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=978.22s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=980.9000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it was like, everywhere else is so tribal. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=982.2s)]
*  Like where you guys are from, 30 minutes down the road, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=984.0400000000001s)]
*  they're completely different groups of people. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=986.24s)]
*  Then I'm in London, I'm like, what do they identify as? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=987.74s)]
*  They've all moved there. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=989.74s)]
*  So like, because London's... [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=991.6800000000001s)]
*  I suppose in a very similar way to New York, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=993.5200000000001s)]
*  London has become so expensive and gentrified [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=996.0600000000001s)]
*  that everyone who used to live here now lives there, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=999.62s)]
*  and everyone who used to live there now lives there. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1002.2600000000001s)]
*  Because everyone gets pushed out by like two miles [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1004.2600000000001s)]
*  every time, things get more and more. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1007.1s)]
*  And there's not much rent control. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1009.62s)]
*  Whereas in New York, you'll get like a 97-year-old Jewish woman [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1011.4s)]
*  on the Upper West Side who's surrounded by millionaires, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1015.16s)]
*  and she's just owned the place for 100 years. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1017.96s)]
*  That doesn't happen in London. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1020.16s)]
*  People do just get pushed out. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1021.6999999999999s)]
*  So in the middle of London, there's just nothing [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1023.14s)]
*  but people who've moved there, pretty much. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1026.34s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1028.8799999999999s)]
*  But sometimes those rules, I remember we went to Abu Dhabi [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1030.1399999999999s)]
*  and they were like, hey, just be careful [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1032.08s)]
*  about some of the things you say. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1033.3799999999999s)]
*  They gave us like a little list. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1034.8799999999999s)]
*  They were like, don't talk about Islam. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1036.08s)]
*  Don't speak about the royal family. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1038.12s)]
*  And he goes, nah, I'm not listening to that shit. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1040.22s)]
*  He just didn't listen to anybody. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1042.1599999999999s)]
*  I actually don't like it when they tell me. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1045.3999999999999s)]
*  Makes you want to do it. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1047.6999999999998s)]
*  Also, I can plead ignorance if I don't really know. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1049.1s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1051.6s)]
*  But if I get sat down with the guys in the outfits [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1052.8999999999999s)]
*  and everything and they tell me all the rules. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1054.54s)]
*  The outfits. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1056.3999999999999s)]
*  Now I'm like, fuck, they just told me this shit dressed up. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1057.58s)]
*  And I feel like there would be something bad there. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1061.6799999999998s)]
*  But then again, if you get arrested for that, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1065.08s)]
*  it's pretty happy. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1068.1799999999998s)]
*  So there's a comedy club that runs, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1069.1799999999998s)]
*  it's called The Laughter Factory. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1071.08s)]
*  It's in Dubai and Abu Dhabi [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1072.3799999999999s)]
*  because they're the same country, aren't they? [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1074.08s)]
*  UAE. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1075.26s)]
*  And they had a guy get arrested at one of their club shows [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1076.26s)]
*  about, it must be like 10, 15 years ago. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1081.1s)]
*  Local guy or foreign? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1083.1s)]
*  No, from the UK. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1084.26s)]
*  So they pretty much fly out UK guys [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1085.6s)]
*  and occasionally they'll get like a road comic [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1088.3s)]
*  from America out there. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1089.84s)]
*  And they're always like, just don't mention the royal family. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1091.1399999999999s)]
*  And they were doing like a two night run at one hotel [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1093.6399999999999s)]
*  and on the second night after the guy had done stuff [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1096.5s)]
*  on the first night, they sent people to the back. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1098.6000000000001s)]
*  And as soon as he went to bring it up again, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1101.64s)]
*  because in his head he's like, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1103.24s)]
*  I got away with it last night. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1104.88s)]
*  And he goes through it again and they were like, come with us. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1106.48s)]
*  And he was in police custody for like three days. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1108.3400000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1110.28s)]
*  What did he say? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1111.78s)]
*  Yeah, I want to know. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1112.8200000000002s)]
*  I think he literally was like, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1113.8200000000002s)]
*  I was told I can't talk about these guys. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1115.8600000000001s)]
*  Who the fuck do they think they are? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1117.06s)]
*  I think he took that attitude and they were like, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1118.96s)]
*  well, this is who the fuck we think we are. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1120.6000000000001s)]
*  Go sit over there for three days. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1123.6000000000001s)]
*  See, that's real royalty. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1125.52s)]
*  Would you respect that royalty? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1126.6s)]
*  I know you don't respect the English royalty. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1128.32s)]
*  Okay, but... [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1129.9s)]
*  I mean, the only reason I'll respect it while I'm out there... [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1131.0s)]
*  Weapons. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1134.46s)]
*  ...is that I don't want to go to jail. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1135.56s)]
*  You know, I'll respect it because I have to. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1139.24s)]
*  But I don't respect anybody who is born naturally [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1141.98s)]
*  better than everyone else. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1145.04s)]
*  It's fucking insane. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1146.14s)]
*  What are you thinking of Megan Markle? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1147.24s)]
*  Like, what do people think of her out there? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1151.92s)]
*  It's a real, like, political issue. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1154.28s)]
*  So the left are like, she's amazing. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1157.08s)]
*  And the right are like, she's a fucking c... [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1159.28s)]
*  But for what? Why is she amazing? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1162.42s)]
*  What did she do? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1164.42s)]
*  Took that little ginger off your hands? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1165.52s)]
*  So, because the left, generally speaking, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1167.42s)]
*  hate the royal family. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1171.16s)]
*  And the working class people, a lot of them are just like, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1173.8600000000001s)]
*  the fucking royal family? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1176.26s)]
*  Like, what the fuck? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1177.26s)]
*  Why do we have to fucking... [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1178.3600000000001s)]
*  Because she's sort of gone in as a normal person, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1180.0s)]
*  broke it up, caused a bit of a problem. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1182.3799999999999s)]
*  And then has sort of gone, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1184.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm not appealing to you fucking reals, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1185.46s)]
*  I'll take your fucking grandson, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1186.86s)]
*  and we're going back to America. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1188.22s)]
*  That's kind of fire. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1189.3999999999999s)]
*  That is kind of fire when you put it that way. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1190.5s)]
*  I'll take your grandson. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1193.3s)]
*  Watch him come with me. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1196.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1197.0s)]
*  So people are like, yeah, fucking good for that. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1198.1s)]
*  I'll take your grandson. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1200.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1201.2s)]
*  Shout out Megan Markle, bro. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1204.3s)]
*  Oh, man, I never saw her like that. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1206.58s)]
*  Are you sleeping now? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1208.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's fire. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1209.3799999999999s)]
*  We hate her here for some reason. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1210.86s)]
*  I think it's just the idea, like, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1212.56s)]
*  Americans really, I think it's the same feeling, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1214.0s)]
*  it's like we really resent people [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1217.04s)]
*  who haven't seemingly earned their success. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1219.3s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1222.48s)]
*  Like the idea of like nepotism or heirs, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1223.48s)]
*  or the royal family. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1225.72s)]
*  Yeah, but then you should hate the royal family. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1226.82s)]
*  And you should like it. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1227.92s)]
*  We don't respect the royal family here. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1229.02s)]
*  Yeah, we don't give a fuck. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1230.12s)]
*  We don't. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1231.22s)]
*  Now, when the Queen died, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1232.32s)]
*  they cancelled comedy clubs across the UK. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1233.42s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1234.92s)]
*  And like friends of mine are like out of work. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1236.02s)]
*  I wasn't even working that weekend, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1237.12s)]
*  but I just put like three shows on, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1238.12s)]
*  and the film was like, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1239.48s)]
*  if you've lost gigs this weekend, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1240.58s)]
*  we'll split the door between everyone. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1241.6799999999998s)]
*  I was like, fuck that. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1242.78s)]
*  That's just not happening. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1243.8799999999999s)]
*  They cancelled the comedy show. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1244.98s)]
*  Because they're like this. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1246.08s)]
*  Have you seen the video of, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1247.1799999999998s)]
*  you know the musical Wicked? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1248.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1249.3799999999999s)]
*  Do you know how it opens? [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1250.48s)]
*  Do you know the first song in Wicked? [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1251.58s)]
*  No. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1252.6799999999998s)]
*  So the first... [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1253.78s)]
*  The first line is, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1254.8799999999999s)]
*  she's dead. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1256.98s)]
*  And it's like good news. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1259.08s)]
*  So the night that the Queen died, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1260.1799999999998s)]
*  the guy who owns the theatre had to go on stage. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1262.1799999999998s)]
*  There's a video of this of him doing this. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1264.1799999999998s)]
*  He goes on stage before the show and goes, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1265.6799999999998s)]
*  Hey, we're really respectful about the Queen and stuff, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1268.14s)]
*  but we've still got to do the full show. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1272.24s)]
*  So just so you all know, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1274.8400000000001s)]
*  if this is the first time you've seen Wicked, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1276.94s)]
*  this isn't like a new bit. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1279.54s)]
*  This is nothing to do with the Queen. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1280.64s)]
*  As many of you are no doubt aware, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1281.74s)]
*  Her Majesty the Queen sadly passed away [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1284.3400000000001s)]
*  earlier this afternoon, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1286.44s)]
*  and we sent deepest condolences to her family. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1288.04s)]

*  And the fact that they had to preface it is so funny. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1317.34s)]
*  Some guy never been on stage before in his life, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1319.4399999999998s)]
*  they're like, you're going to have to go on. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1321.54s)]
*  It always makes it worse, because I bet you have to be like, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1323.6399999999999s)]
*  we're not thinking about it, you know what I mean? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1325.64s)]
*  And then the fact is, I know this sounds like we're happy the Queen's dead. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1327.74s)]
*  It only takes one person to complain though, doesn't it? [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1329.8400000000001s)]
*  And then it's a news story, so it's best they do it that way. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1331.94s)]
*  Oh, that's unreal. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1335.0400000000002s)]
*  I didn't realize you were such a theatre fan. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1336.64s)]
*  Yeah, like... [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1338.74s)]
*  You love musicals. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1339.8400000000001s)]
*  I've seen quite a lot, yeah. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1340.94s)]
*  I'd never watched it until about maybe like six years ago, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1343.0400000000002s)]
*  and then I heard Hamilton. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1346.14s)]
*  All I knew about Hamilton was it was like a hip-hop musical. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1348.24s)]
*  And I was like, I really want to go and see that. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1350.3400000000001s)]
*  And an ex-girlfriend got me tickets to go and see it, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1352.44s)]
*  and then at the end of the first song, like, this is incredible. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1354.44s)]
*  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1357.54s)]
*  I couldn't believe it. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1359.64s)]
*  And then I like watching them. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1361.74s)]
*  Do you want to know how incredible Hamilton is? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1363.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1365.94s)]
*  Once we went to like a private dance club in Hawaii. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1368.04s)]
*  Strip club. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1371.14s)]
*  But there was like a little private room with a stripper's comment. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1373.24s)]
*  I can comment. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1375.3400000000001s)]
*  He's trying to be nice. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1377.44s)]
*  And they gave you an aux cord, and you get to control the music. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1379.54s)]
*  And I go, Mark, you know what you got to do. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1382.94s)]
*  And he's like, I got it. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1385.04s)]
*  I see Mark go up to the aux, plugging in, and the next thing I hear is, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1387.1399999999999s)]
*  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1389.24s)]
*  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1391.34s)]
*  Dun, dun, dun, dun. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1393.44s)]
*  How does a bastard [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1395.54s)]
*  With a song of a poor and a scotched rot [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1397.6399999999999s)]
*  And a little bit of a... [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1399.74s)]
*  Within, I was saying like five minutes we were just singing and dancing, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1401.84s)]
*  and the strippers were all just sitting down like so confused. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1403.94s)]
*  One walked down the room. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1406.04s)]
*  They tipped us really well. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1408.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they did. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1410.24s)]
*  They were trying to give us drugs, they were just like, I think if we settle them down, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1412.24s)]
*  they'll let us get naked. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1415.28s)]
*  I've been banging on about it for years that I really liked it, and the lads we do our [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1417.0s)]
*  podcasts with have been like, I can't think of anything fucking worse. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1421.76s)]
*  And I was like, you've just got to see it, it's fucking great. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1424.76s)]
*  And then there was a touring version of it that came to Manchester, and I was like, look, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1428.52s)]
*  we're going, podcast night out, few beers and we're going to see Hamilton. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1432.56s)]
*  And the cast was so bad. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1436.68s)]
*  So I was sat next to Finn, who's one of our producers, and he loves it as well. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1439.92s)]
*  And like, Carl and Dan were sat behind us, and they'd been like fucking dragged to see [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1443.8000000000002s)]
*  this thing, you know what I mean? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1448.1200000000001s)]
*  And we were about halfway through, and I just looked at Finn, and Finn was already looking [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1449.1200000000001s)]
*  at me, and Finn was like, this is a lot gayer than I remember it being. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1453.1200000000001s)]
*  I was like, yeah, it really is, and we got to the interval, and went up, and I tried [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1458.6000000000001s)]
*  to be like, so what do you think? [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1467.16s)]
*  And Carl and Dan were like, are you fucking insane? [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1468.8s)]
*  It was so bad. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1472.76s)]
*  If that was the first time I'd ever seen it, I wouldn't like it. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1473.76s)]
*  Is it weird to have that showing in England? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1475.72s)]
*  No. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1478.44s)]
*  Like, the historical count of the Revolutionary War. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1479.44s)]
*  So, like, this is... [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1482.28s)]
*  There's no way you learn how we learn it. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1483.84s)]
*  No, we don't learn it at all. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1486.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1487.72s)]

*  Yeah, you guys had to help. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1502.8400000000001s)]
*  Somebody had to stop that war that was already over, and just military weapons. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1503.8400000000001s)]
*  We don't learn anything about it, so like... [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1512.72s)]
*  So we didn't help out at all in the way you learn? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1514.2800000000002s)]
*  In World War II? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1516.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1517.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, the Americans sort of helped at the end, but this whole, like, we would [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1518.88s)]
*  be speaking German if it wasn't for America, it's just like, that's not really true. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1521.7600000000002s)]
*  Really? [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1525.44s)]

*  It might have been, I don't know the exact number, but it was a lot. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1543.88s)]
*  It was a lot. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1547.64s)]
*  They don't love Churchill. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1548.64s)]
*  They don't love him at all over there. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1549.64s)]

*  I think to this day, he's like, hey, he's a black guy. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1554.52s)]
*  Joke, joke, joke's really funny about that, I know he isn't, but in my head, he is. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1556.52s)]

*  Hamilton in America was like not a very, in our generation, was not a very popular figure. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1577.04s)]
*  Totally. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1580.88s)]
*  Like they were gonna replace him, I think, on the bill. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1581.88s)]
*  I think that was the plan. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1584.3200000000002s)]
*  And Aaron Burr, the extent of Burr was a Got Milk commercial. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1585.3200000000002s)]

*  And he goes, and they go, who is the person that had a duel with Hamilton and then shot [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1600.16s)]
*  him and then killed Alexander Hamilton? [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1604.2s)]
*  And the guy goes, oh, he can't get it out because he doesn't have milk. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1607.24s)]

*  And then I remember seeing Hamilton, I was like, oh, the milk guy. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1616.88s)]
*  What a legacy. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1623.68s)]
*  Do you know what's really interesting about like the American Civil War thing is? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1624.68s)]
*  Real quick, sorry. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1629.48s)]
*  So when you're watching a play of like the American Revolution in England, is there like [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1630.48s)]
*  a complete disconnect to an event that happened in history? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1635.44s)]
*  Like I don't think Americans are there yet to like have a play. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1639.1200000000001s)]
*  Like if there was a Vietnamese play about how they won the war, I don't think it'd be [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1641.82s)]
*  like celebrated in America. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1645.8999999999999s)]
*  I just think if, yeah, genuinely, even though we know it's not, it sort of like feels like [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1648.1399999999999s)]
*  fiction. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1653.18s)]
*  Not that we're saying it's like lies. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1654.18s)]
*  It just feels like, do you know what I mean? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1655.18s)]
*  It feels like wicked. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1656.18s)]
*  It's wicked. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1657.18s)]
*  I don't know if things are so silly. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1658.18s)]
*  It's just not like, it doesn't look like you're watching a loss. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1663.18s)]
*  No, and it's not like, it doesn't feel like that. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1667.98s)]
*  We're so small compared to you guys. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1671.1000000000001s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense that we would run this place to me. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1673.66s)]
*  Like if I actually... [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1677.5s)]
*  Oh, that's fascinating. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1678.5s)]
*  I've never really thought about it, but I'm thinking about it right now. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1679.5s)]
*  We are a colony of you. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1682.14s)]
*  The idea that like, I don't even want the king to run Liverpool. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1684.7s)]
*  Why would he have control of Baltimore? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1688.26s)]
*  The king is the best character in it. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1693.9s)]
*  Oh, it's so funny. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1695.54s)]
*  I mean, it's amazing. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1696.54s)]
*  It's so funny. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1697.54s)]
*  But like you guys, I guess because you're taught of it as like this victory and it's [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1699.1399999999999s)]
*  part of like the American thing is like, oh, we got our independence. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1702.94s)]
*  Rebellion is like part of the identity. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1705.54s)]
*  So any story that has rebellion, we get all excited about. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1708.1399999999999s)]
*  Totally. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1711.1s)]
*  And it's the only time it's ever been like sort of contextualized for me like that is [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1712.1s)]
*  and it was actually, it was to do with the show. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1716.7s)]
*  So I went to Nashville in the summer. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1718.78s)]
*  At the end of my tour, Althea opens for me and he's also a brilliant comic and Jack, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1720.94s)]
*  he was my tour manager. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1727.5s)]
*  And we went to Nashville for a week to just let rip, drink, music, whatever. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1729.46s)]
*  And it was Jordan's CMA Fest, like the country music association festival. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1733.1s)]
*  So they have like stadium shows and I was like, well on the Friday, we'll go to that. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1736.7s)]
*  We'll go and see that. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1739.42s)]
*  And we're in the stadium and I go to go to the bar and get some drinks. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1740.42s)]
*  And as I get to the top of the stairs, some like real southern guy like dressed like he [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1745.02s)]
*  like he's I'm wearing the bleachers, you know, so and he's got like, you know, flannel shirts [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1750.02s)]
*  on trucker cap and he's like, hey man, can I get a quick photo with you? [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1753.94s)]
*  And I was like, yes, I seen you a while ago on Flager and I seen some of your stuff. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1757.22s)]
*  I like it, man. I like it. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1760.58s)]
*  Can we get a photo? [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1761.58s)]
*  And we take a photo and I then go and carry on to go and he goes, hey, Adam, Adam, don't [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1762.58s)]
*  forget the Civil War. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1767.8600000000001s)]
*  Don't forget the Revolutionary War. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1769.14s)]
*  And I was like, what? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1772.1000000000001s)]
*  And he goes, we won, man. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1772.98s)]
*  And I was like. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1774.38s)]
*  I get to the bar to Althea and Jack. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1779.18s)]
*  I was like, some guy just asked me for a photo and started yelling about some war. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1780.78s)]
*  I love that. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1785.22s)]
*  I love that. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1786.22s)]
*  I love you, but you kicked your ass. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1787.22s)]
*  That's the most American. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1790.22s)]
*  He'd see me on media. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1791.22s)]
*  Yeah, that's great. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1792.22s)]
*  And shout out to him. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1794.22s)]
*  That's the mouth. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1797.22s)]
*  I'm one. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1798.22s)]
*  Like, yeah, this is like, I guess, a peculiar question, but it's the observation I had [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1799.22s)]
*  when I was in when I was in Britain is there's all these tiny little towns that have kind [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1803.22s)]
*  of evolved independently from this idea of England. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1809.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1813.22s)]
*  And then the empire kind of swallows them all up. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1814.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1816.22s)]
*  But they have their own identities. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1817.22s)]
*  Some of them do. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1818.22s)]
*  Some of them do. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1819.22s)]
*  Whereas like the states in America are added after the 13 as America. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1820.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1826.22s)]
*  Like if you don't have an identity outside of us, maybe Texas because they almost did [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1827.22s)]
*  their own thing, but it's rare. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1832.22s)]
*  So I wonder if that changes things where like you don't really personalize like what the [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1834.22s)]
*  greater England did because there are people there a thousand years ago just doing their [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1837.22s)]
*  thing anyway. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1841.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1842.22s)]
*  And to be fair, you know, like other loyalists in Liverpool for the crown. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1843.22s)]
*  Yeah, but it's a it's a very small minority. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1847.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1851.22s)]
*  I'm like, what do you think of them? [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1852.22s)]
*  Of like the of the loyalists of the crown. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1854.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1857.22s)]
*  Don't speak to them. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1858.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1859.22s)]
*  They're not in my life. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1860.22s)]
*  I just hear they exist, you know, like when and this this obviously when I'm doing like [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1861.22s)]
*  podcasts and stuff in America like this, like people do want to talk about the British [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1866.22s)]
*  thing. I'm probably a really bad person to talk to about it because of the way Liverpool [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1870.22s)]
*  sees the rest. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1875.22s)]
*  And I'm not as like hardline as some scousers are with this. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1876.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1879.22s)]
*  You know, like there's a lot of like people from Liverpool who when the England football [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1880.22s)]
*  team plays, they actively want them to win. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1884.22s)]
*  Like if England are playing Spain, there's scousers who will buy a Spain jersey and go [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1887.22s)]
*  the pub in the Spain jersey and be like, come on Spain, because they hated that much. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1892.22s)]
*  With me, I kind of want England to win and the second they lose, I'm like, it's a shit. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1897.22s)]
*  Whereas Liverpool can lose a game and it'll take me a month to get over it. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1902.22s)]
*  Got it. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1905.22s)]
*  Like there's such a this is quite like I do like I don't really like the the uber English [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1906.22s)]
*  attitude. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1913.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1914.22s)]
*  And I think a lot of the pride that like people on the centre right to the right of like British [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1915.22s)]
*  politics have is rooted in racism and colonialism. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1922.22s)]
*  Really? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1925.22s)]
*  It just is. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1926.22s)]
*  It's like we conquered the world. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1927.22s)]
*  It's like that shouldn't be your only reason to be proud of the country. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1929.22s)]
*  That's not actually a fucking good thing. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1932.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1934.22s)]
*  So there's a lot of stuff to not like. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1935.22s)]
*  Subbatable. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1937.22s)]
*  You go to some places that England never got to and you're like you could have used a little [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1938.22s)]
*  bit. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1943.22s)]
*  I just got back from India and I'm telling you we have left our place in a mess. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1944.22s)]
*  You didn't go before. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1949.22s)]
*  It was crazy before. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1950.22s)]
*  Honestly. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1951.22s)]
*  You've got to train now. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1952.22s)]
*  I mean I love that thing. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1953.22s)]
*  The train is going by the way. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1955.22s)]
*  I was a real good train by the way. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1956.22s)]
*  He's so British. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1959.22s)]
*  He's the colonel comes out. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1960.22s)]
*  It's the best train. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1961.22s)]
*  But when you see him on top of the train riding it aren't you like that was worth the jewel. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1962.22s)]
*  Try like they're enjoying that thing. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1967.22s)]
*  Imagine they got a roller coaster. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1969.22s)]
*  Oh. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1971.22s)]
*  You drop the roller coaster in Mumbai dude. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1972.22s)]
*  They would sort it out. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1975.22s)]
*  One six foot. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1976.22s)]
*  We're not even hungry anymore. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1979.22s)]
*  We're having too much fun. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1984.22s)]
*  Don't worry about throwing up either. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1986.22s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1989.22s)]
*  I just don't like it's funny. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1990.22s)]
*  So a couple like when. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1992.22s)]
*  But that's good perspective to have. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1993.22s)]
*  Like I think a lot of Americans don't know that about England. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1995.22s)]
*  I think that we assume that every country is kind of like us incredibly proud of themselves [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=1997.22s)]
*  and that's it. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2002.22s)]
*  That's the identity. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2003.22s)]
*  Yeah we're divided in America. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2004.22s)]
*  But for the most part Americans are like it's America and then fuck the rest of y'all. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2005.22s)]
*  Whereas you know you go to Spain and there are parts of Spain that are like we're not [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2010.22s)]
*  Spanish. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2014.22s)]
*  Yeah like like Barcelona and Catalonia. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2015.22s)]
*  Catalonia the Basque country. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2017.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2019.22s)]
*  You just had riots right in Liverpool like a couple months ago. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2020.22s)]
*  A few months ago. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2022.22s)]
*  That was that was the first time that like Liverpool sort of had a grooming party. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2023.22s)]
*  We can talk about this story if you want but it's fucking bleak. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2028.22s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2033.22s)]
*  Oh really. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2034.22s)]
*  So there was a guy called Axel. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2035.22s)]
*  We won't joke around about it at all. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2036.22s)]
*  We're not going to joke around about it at all. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2038.22s)]
*  This is going to go poorly. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2040.22s)]
*  It's so bleak. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2041.22s)]
*  Really? [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2042.22s)]
*  And it's so fresh. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2043.22s)]
*  Oh fuck. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2044.22s)]
*  Like a guy went into a seven year old's like dance class and stabbed three seven year old [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2045.22s)]
*  girls to death. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2051.2200000000003s)]
*  Oh I didn't know that's what it was about. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2052.2200000000003s)]
*  Great job Mark. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2053.2200000000003s)]
*  The riots and the guy's called Axel Rudicabana and he's the son of immigrants and although [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2054.2200000000003s)]
*  there's a widespread belief that his his motivations are rooted in Islam even though that's not [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2064.22s)]
*  like being actually released as information. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2071.22s)]
*  Everyone's just gone fucking looking at the guy. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2073.22s)]
*  He's probably. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2075.22s)]
*  Yeah yeah yeah. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2076.22s)]
*  And you know he's like he stabbed one of these girls 122 times. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2077.22s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2081.22s)]
*  Like it is one of the worst. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2082.22s)]
*  So what happens to somebody like that? [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2085.22s)]
*  I mean you kill them right? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2086.22s)]
*  There's no death penalty. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2087.22s)]
*  Well what do you do with people like that? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2088.22s)]
*  He's been put in prison for a minimum of 52 years which means technically in 52 years [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2090.22s)]
*  he could be released. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2096.22s)]
*  But somebody in prison will kill him right? [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2097.22s)]
*  I got sent a voice note today on WhatsApp so like when stuff happens in the UK like they'll [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2099.22s)]
*  like you'll get like forwarded many times there's like a thing on WhatsApp and it's [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2105.22s)]
*  a voice note saying he's already been absolutely battered in prison but people won't kill him. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2109.22s)]
*  They'll just make his time in there impossible. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2114.22s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2116.22s)]
*  And like the COs, the correction officers will be like. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2117.22s)]
*  They look the other way. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2120.22s)]
*  They'll go they won't just look the other way. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2121.22s)]
*  They will go and get the two most dangerous guys in the prison and be like you know in [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2122.22s)]
*  cell seven do you know what he's in for? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2126.22s)]
*  Well the door's open. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2128.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2129.22s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2130.22s)]
*  But yeah. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2131.22s)]
*  So the riots were about that and then people were fucking it up. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2132.22s)]
*  The riots were anti-immigration riots being like look what happens when we have borders [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2134.22s)]
*  open. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2138.22s)]
*  Is this guy's parents get in they have him here and then he goes and kills. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2139.22s)]
*  But again it's because look what this guy's done is fucking horrific and it's very hard [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2144.22s)]
*  to have this conversation especially because this happened in Southport which is eight [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2151.22s)]
*  miles from where I live. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2156.22s)]
*  Like it's up the road maybe 20 at maximum. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2157.22s)]
*  It's up like Southport is where on a sunny day in the summer that's where me and my family [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2160.22s)]
*  would go. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2165.22s)]
*  There's like a theme park there with roller coasters no Indians on them. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2166.22s)]
*  And we'd go there from there. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2169.22s)]
*  Yet. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2171.22s)]
*  Not after this. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2172.22s)]
*  And it's absolutely harrowing. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2173.22s)]
*  It's one of the worst stories of my lifetime that I can remember. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2177.22s)]
*  And because people got real angry and they had that they were given a reason. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2180.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2186.22s)]
*  He did it because of this. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2187.22s)]
*  So then the protests were and riots were fucking huge. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2188.22s)]
*  But there's also these fucking protests and riots with like six packs of Stella and they're [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2192.22s)]
*  being like hey we're at the riots. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2197.22s)]
*  And you don't give a shit. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2198.22s)]
*  You want a reason to go and smash a town up and get drunk with your mates. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2200.22s)]
*  You're a thug. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2203.22s)]
*  Some people genuinely care about the fucking safety of children and you know they're there [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2204.22s)]
*  for the right reasons. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2208.22s)]
*  But a good chunk of these fucking riots were people who just seen an opportunity to go [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2209.22s)]
*  and get hammered on a Tuesday night and smash up a place with no retribution. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2213.22s)]
*  That's the yeah that's the tricky thing is that like a certain amount of people are going [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2216.22s)]
*  to be crazy. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2219.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2220.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2221.22s)]
*  Like and that is going to be consistent across whatever culture. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2222.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2224.22s)]
*  And when you have people that are entering your country you know a certain percentage [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2225.22s)]
*  of them are going to be crazy. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2228.22s)]
*  And the idea I imagine with an open border is that there's no way to discern who is or [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2229.22s)]
*  isn't. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2235.22s)]
*  Now there's no way to tell if somebody's kid is going to be crazy. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2236.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2239.22s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2240.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2241.22s)]
*  But I get I get the anger that somebody has in a situation where like we need we can at [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2242.22s)]
*  least control this if we just stop people from coming in. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2246.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2249.22s)]
*  And but you're not going to control crazy. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2250.22s)]
*  They're going to be fucking Jimmy Savills. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2252.22s)]
*  Totally. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2254.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2255.22s)]
*  And I think that's the answer is no matter what that like I think the job obviously this [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2256.22s)]
*  is a more serious conversation but I think the job of a comedian often is to stand right [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2260.22s)]
*  in the middle of the spectrum of conversation and talk and laugh at how both sides of any [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2264.22s)]
*  conversation are discussing it because on the right there's always going to be hypocrisy [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2269.22s)]
*  on the left there's always going to be hypocrisy and I'm talking about any spectrum there and [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2273.22s)]
*  until both sides are and we're so far from this because everything is genuinely really [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2277.22s)]
*  conversationally until both sides find a way to be able to go. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2283.22s)]
*  Do you know what? [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2286.22s)]
*  You've got a good point there. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2287.22s)]
*  But yes. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2288.22s)]
*  But that's not going to happen. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2289.22s)]
*  We're so far from it. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2291.22s)]
*  All right guys. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2292.22s)]
*  Staying break for a second. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2293.22s)]
*  I'm very excited to have this sponsor on the pod. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2294.22s)]
*  I briefly mentioned them in the Vivek episode. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2296.22s)]
*  Vivek was talking about the importance of compound interest without being too like nerdy [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2299.22s)]
*  and boring. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2305.22s)]
*  I think it's really cool what this company Acorns has done. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2306.22s)]
*  What they're trying to do is get you to actually invest, not gamble. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2309.22s)]
*  What a lot of us do with the stock market right now, not me because I don't know what [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2312.22s)]
*  the hell I'm doing is gamble. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2315.22s)]
*  All right. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2317.22s)]
*  You try to pick a stock. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2318.22s)]
*  You try to see where it goes. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2319.22s)]
*  You're not Nancy Pelosi. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2320.22s)]
*  You're not any of these other politicians. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2321.22s)]
*  You don't know what's going to happen to market and you're trying to time it and you know [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2322.22s)]
*  who else is trying to time it? [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2324.22s)]
*  Billion and trillion dollar hedge funds and money managers like you're not going to beat [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2326.22s)]
*  them. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2331.22s)]
*  But what you can do is you can invest with Acorns and by invest I mean put money in and [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2332.22s)]
*  let compound interest work for you. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2338.22s)]
*  You put in and it's the long term. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2340.22s)]
*  It's over 10 years. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2342.22s)]
*  It's over 20 years. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2343.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2344.22s)]
*  Vivek was talking about it very eloquently. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2345.22s)]
*  But the idea is is you're going to invest that money and you're going to let the American [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2347.22s)]

*  The strategy here is long term. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2358.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2361.22s)]
*  If you're looking for quick money, that's not Acorns. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2362.22s)]
*  Don't use Acorns. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2363.22s)]
*  But if you're looking to set yourself up and you're looking to provide for yourself in [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2364.22s)]
*  the future and let the American economy work with you and by the American economy, I mean [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2369.22s)]

*  Okay. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2378.22s)]
*  And over the long term, it looks so far so good. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2379.22s)]
*  Hopefully Donnie T takes it to the moon. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2381.22s)]

*  And if you want to be investing that growth, which you should, because that's what these [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2388.22s)]
*  rich people are doing. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2391.22s)]

*  You should start with whatever money you have. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2398.22s)]
*  Let compound interest do its work. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2400.22s)]
*  Compound interest essentially, if you're looking at like a, let's say it's a 5% or a 10% return [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2401.22s)]
*  a year, you do that over 20 years, you're actually going to put your, some real money [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2406.22s)]

*  throwing a fucking Nazi slur. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2567.66s)]
*  Did he mean to tell everybody he's a Nazi in that moment? [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2569.14s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2572.18s)]

*  He didn't mean to. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2574.18s)]
*  I do think he meant to do what he did though. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2575.18s)]
*  I think it's sort of like, let's see what I can. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2576.18s)]
*  It's debatable. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2579.74s)]
*  Maybe that's the case. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2580.74s)]
*  Maybe not. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2581.74s)]
*  And then we can even have that discussion. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2582.74s)]
*  I don't think that he that that was what he did. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2583.74s)]
*  But there is a version where you could just be like, I did some dumbass shit right there. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2585.2999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2589.54s)]
*  Like you can just acknowledge it. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2590.54s)]
*  You don't have to be like, you guys are stupid. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2591.54s)]
*  I can't believe you do that. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2592.54s)]
*  Or find all these excuses. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2593.54s)]
*  He was technically doing a Roman salute. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2594.54s)]
*  We're like, that is what the Nazis were doing though. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2595.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2598.3399999999997s)]
*  So when people like, it's a Roman salute, the Nazis back then were like, we're doing [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2599.3399999999997s)]
*  a Roman salute. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2602.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2603.1s)]
*  Like they're not different. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2604.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2605.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2606.1s)]
*  I guess what I'm trying to say is like, Hitler was like, we all do the Roman salute. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2607.46s)]
*  By you going, I'm not doing the Hitler one, I'm doing the Roman one. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2612.62s)]
*  That's like saying, you know. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2615.7s)]
*  My point is like, there was always right wing guys like, oh, you can't make fun of anybody [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2617.38s)]
*  and what happened to comedy? [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2620.2599999999998s)]
*  We should be in fun of whatever. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2621.5s)]
*  And the second the jokes are about Elon, it's like, oh, dude, it used to be funny. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2622.54s)]
*  This is fucked up shit. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2626.86s)]
*  You just became the guy you were criticizing for the last four years. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2627.86s)]
*  Ben Shapiro talking about Bill Baer. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2630.5s)]
*  What did he say? [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2632.46s)]
*  He said, I've been a Bill Baer fan for years. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2633.46s)]
*  I thought he's absolutely brilliant. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2634.86s)]
*  I went to see him in Florida. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2635.9s)]
*  He's gone woke. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2637.6200000000003s)]
*  Like Bill Baer's gone woke. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2638.6200000000003s)]
*  This is another thing. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2640.2200000000003s)]
*  Like there are narratives that happen when a comedian gets to like a certain size, right? [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2641.2200000000003s)]
*  A certain level of success. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2646.1400000000003s)]
*  Like I haven't seen it happen with me. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2647.1400000000003s)]
*  I've seen it happen with other people. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2648.6200000000003s)]
*  And these narratives just sprout up and you have to be a certain level of success for [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2650.54s)]
*  the narratives to even pop up. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2653.94s)]
*  And what's interesting about Burr is like, Burr is one of the most prolific comedians [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2655.7200000000003s)]
*  that's ever existed. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2659.1400000000003s)]
*  And I've seen this thing happen like, oh, he's going, whoa, girl. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2661.2000000000003s)]
*  Honestly, I think this is my take on it. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2665.2200000000003s)]
*  It's like when feminism, like the pendulum swung way too far in one direction and you [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2667.7400000000002s)]
*  could never feel like you could make fun of women. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2673.14s)]
*  And women were saying insane shit. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2674.86s)]
*  These like with the protection of feminism, if you call them out on it, then you're a [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2676.7400000000002s)]
*  sexist and you're a bigot. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2680.5s)]
*  So everybody was really scared. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2681.86s)]
*  Comedians who had jokes about the absurdity of this extreme feminism gained a lot of popularity [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2684.02s)]
*  because you could get the sentiment that we all had out. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2689.1800000000003s)]
*  I mean, I definitely benefited from that. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2691.7000000000003s)]
*  I had plenty of jokes about that. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2693.38s)]
*  And Bill was amazing and prolific at that. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2694.9s)]
*  Now the pendulum has swung back. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2698.6200000000003s)]
*  We don't need to make fun of feminists all the time. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2701.02s)]
*  We realize that they're retarded. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2702.98s)]
*  So now he's going just making fun of whatever he wants to make fun of right now. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2705.38s)]
*  But because he doesn't offer that like social utility for you, now he's gone woke and now [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2709.06s)]
*  he's not funny. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2714.38s)]
*  It's bullshit. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2715.38s)]
*  I also think. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2716.38s)]
*  You never liked him. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2717.38s)]
*  You like that he made you feel good with your feelings. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2718.38s)]
*  Yes. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2720.7400000000002s)]
*  He validates your opinions with jokes. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2721.7400000000002s)]
*  You never respected the craft or the art of comedy. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2723.14s)]
*  Totally. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2725.8199999999997s)]
*  And as a comic for me, like when I'm watching comedy, like when I sort of, it's not even [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2726.8199999999997s)]
*  necessarily the most I ever laugh. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2731.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2733.02s)]
*  But the most respect I ever have for a comedian is when I do not know what, I don't think [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2734.02s)]
*  you should ever know what a comedian's real opinion on any subject is. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2738.18s)]
*  Like when a comic brings a subject up and it could be, oh, I'm going to talk about trans [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2741.2599999999998s)]
*  people now or whatever. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2744.66s)]
*  When I know what your next four minutes of opinions are going to be, I'm done with it. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2746.14s)]
*  And I do think some comics get to a certain level and we don't have to name names. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2753.18s)]
*  I hate slagging off comics and stuff like publicly and whatever, but there's certain [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2756.02s)]
*  comics who are big, like arena level comics and they bring shit up now and I'm like, we [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2759.02s)]
*  know the angle. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2763.66s)]
*  I know exactly what you think on this, even as a comic. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2764.66s)]
*  And it would be so much funnier if you, if Bill Beren is doing an hour about why women [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2768.02s)]
*  are great, that'll be the best thing he's doing. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2773.7s)]
*  It's so funny. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2775.7s)]
*  As long as it's funny. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2776.7s)]
*  I don't care if you're woke, as long as it's funny. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2777.7s)]
*  Yeah, I'm assuming a baseline that the comic is getting laughed at. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2780.02s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2782.82s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2783.82s)]
*  And that's what I hate about the criticism, right? [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2784.82s)]
*  It's like you can be funny and have a progressive line of thinking. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2785.82s)]
*  There was a guy named John Stewart that did it really effectively for the last fucking [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2790.02s)]
*  two decades probably. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2793.66s)]
*  So yeah, it's like, it's really, it's a shame when you see these people that they seem to [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2795.5s)]
*  like be fighting for comedy and everybody can get these jokes and the second the jokes [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2800.5s)]
*  are kind of against their point of view, all of a sudden now that person is completely [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2803.78s)]
*  changed. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2807.98s)]
*  So that's about your thing. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2809.06s)]
*  And like there's certain stuff people could bring up that I would be offended by, but [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2810.06s)]
*  you've just got to, you know, you've got to just, I've said this before on another podcast [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2813.46s)]
*  years ago. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2818.02s)]
*  This is how I view comedy. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2819.02s)]
*  This is like my sort of the way I like to think about it. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2820.02s)]
*  It's like we're lawyers, right? [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2823.9s)]
*  We're like defense lawyers and the bit is our client and our job isn't to worry about [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2826.1s)]
*  whether they're guilty or not. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2831.3s)]
*  Our job is to get them off. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2832.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2834.1s)]
*  Our job is to convince the jury that this is an innocent thing and it doesn't matter [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2835.1s)]
*  whether like I take any clients on, you could say this is, this is what my opinion is on [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2840.7799999999997s)]
*  this. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2845.3399999999997s)]
*  I've got to win the jury over and that's why bad comics, they were like, oh, the crowd [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2846.3399999999997s)]
*  are too woke for me. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2850.06s)]
*  It's like, no, no, no, you're a bad lawyer. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2851.06s)]
*  You couldn't convince a jury of your peers that your premise was innocent. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2852.94s)]
*  If you had an attorney say that, be like, dude, you're going to jail because that jury [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2858.2999999999997s)]
*  is so woke. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2860.9s)]
*  That fucking jury sucks. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2862.9s)]
*  I would have been like, that's not good. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2864.9s)]
*  You said you'd save my life. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2866.9s)]
*  Yeah, look at the fucking vote. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2868.9s)]
*  No, you're 100% right. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2870.9s)]
*  It's, it's, comedy should be like your emotional reaction to something. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2872.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2875.9s)]
*  It doesn't have to be what you know to be right or wrong. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2876.9s)]
*  It's how you feel in the moment. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2878.9s)]
*  Like all the old Borschfeld comics, take my wife, please. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2880.9s)]
*  You don't really want someone to take your fucking wife. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2882.9s)]
*  But there's moments where you're like, get this bitch away from me. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2884.9s)]
*  Right? [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2887.9s)]
*  And that's the sentiment of the joke. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2888.9s)]
*  So as long as you're honoring that emotional reaction to the joke, it doesn't matter what's fucking true or not true. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2889.9s)]
*  And these Ben Shapiro types, I don't know why we would give a flying fuck what they think about comedy anyway. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2894.9s)]
*  Like he literally says, facts don't care about your feelings. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2899.9s)]
*  Comedy should not deal with facts at all. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2901.9s)]
*  Like the facts guys stay out of comedy. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2904.9s)]
*  We're liars. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2907.9s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2909.9s)]
*  I want the liar comments. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2910.9s)]
*  I want the comments like, I'm going to lie and it's going to be funny for the next hour. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2911.9s)]
*  I'm like, I lied to you. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2914.9s)]
*  You are interesting to me. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2916.9s)]
*  You know, like when Patrice O'Neill talks about harassment day. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2918.9s)]
*  He's not literally saying we should sexually harass women one day out of the year. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2922.9s)]
*  But emotionally. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2927.9s)]
*  That's all comedy has to be. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2931.9s)]
*  It'd be funny if. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2933.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2934.9s)]
*  I don't want to do this. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2935.9s)]
*  It'd be funny if. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2936.9s)]
*  We got the grooming gangs and we got the girls that fuck everybody. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2937.9s)]
*  It'd be funny if we connected them. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2940.9s)]
*  Tell the grooming gangs show up at Bonnie Blue's next thing. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2942.9s)]
*  It'd be funny if. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2945.9s)]
*  Why is that so hard for these nerds like Shapiro to understand? [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2948.9s)]
*  Because he's a super autistic like ones and zeros guy. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2951.9s)]
*  And comedy is in between ones and zeros. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2957.9s)]
*  It's twos and threes and fours and fives. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2959.9s)]
*  Well now you're exciting them. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2961.9s)]
*  But yes, a hundred percent. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2965.9s)]
*  It's between the line. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2966.9s)]
*  It's that emotion, it's that feeling, it's everything in between. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2967.9s)]
*  Most people have a thing where they go, there's nothing funny about blank. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2970.9s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2973.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2974.9s)]
*  The comics go, no, there's something funny about. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2975.9s)]
*  There's nothing funny to you. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2976.9s)]
*  About like this. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2978.9s)]
*  And that's why we do it. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2979.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2980.9s)]
*  You're not a comedian. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2981.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2982.9s)]
*  Ben Shapiro, you're the guy who says if comedians are too woke or not. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2983.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2986.9s)]
*  You have a new girlfriend, right? [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2988.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2989.9s)]
*  Has she seen your old set where you talk about your old girlfriend? [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2990.9s)]
*  Well, I can't wait for this breakup. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2993.9s)]
*  All my cards are with me. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=2997.9s)]
*  Speaking of understanding comedy. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3000.9s)]
*  Apple Pay is just on my phone. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3001.9s)]
*  I wonder if she's seen the old set and is like, oh, I better act right, bro. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3003.9s)]
*  Or if she wants to be famous. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3007.9s)]
*  Act very well. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3009.9s)]
*  Yeah, you got to be careful for the toxics. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3011.9s)]
*  The girl I'm with now is we've been friends for a few years. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3015.9s)]
*  So she, we were friends actually when I was working, that's the first. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3018.9s)]
*  So she's seen like an early warm up for that show. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3021.9s)]
*  We've been together since July and yeah, she's great. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3024.9s)]
*  Asian? [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3028.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3029.9s)]
*  No. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3030.9s)]
*  It's not an eye joke. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3031.9s)]
*  Go back to your roots. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3035.9s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3037.9s)]
*  And your girls love you, they're just like, how does he open it so? [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3039.9s)]
*  They just have to sleep on this side of the bed. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3044.9s)]
*  Oh, bro. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3046.9s)]
*  Now you're like the Taylor Swift of comics, man. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3049.9s)]
*  Getting a relationship break up. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3053.9s)]
*  Oh, I got a new special now. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3055.9s)]
*  You do one hour. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3057.9s)]
*  And that sticks forever. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3058.9s)]
*  Bro, that's funny though. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3061.9s)]
*  I mean, you got to talk about your shit. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3062.9s)]
*  It was a crazy story though. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3064.9s)]
*  I'd like, yeah, I'm genuinely like for legal reasons, I have to stress it was fictional. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3066.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3072.9s)]
*  It's a totally fictional. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3073.9s)]
*  Completely. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3075.9s)]
*  Completely fictional. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3076.9s)]
*  There's no truth in it at all. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3077.9s)]
*  And any resemblance to real life is purely coincidental. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3079.9s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3082.9s)]
*  You need those coincidences. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3083.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3084.9s)]
*  You have an hour of coincidences. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3085.9s)]
*  It's fucking wild. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3086.9s)]
*  Like my mum's an alcoholic in real life and in the show. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3088.9s)]
*  What are the fucking coincidences? [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3092.9s)]
*  I could have written anything. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3095.9s)]
*  Bro, that's a funny thing to put in the beginning of a special. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3097.9s)]
*  For legal reasons, all of this is fictional. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3102.9s)]
*  Well, that's even more enticing. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3106.9s)]
*  Yeah, right? [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3108.9s)]
*  Yeah, it was interesting putting a special like that out because, you know, that for me, that hour, [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3110.9s)]
*  so the hour you're talking about there is called Juicy. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3116.9s)]
*  And that is more of like an Edinburgh Festival type hour of stand up where it's, you know, it's one long story. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3119.9s)]
*  I'm sat down for a lot of it. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3126.9s)]
*  Like we shot it in a small room very deliberately. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3128.9s)]
*  And that is not the way I've came up. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3131.9s)]
*  Although I, you know, I've gone to the Edinburgh Festival and done hours and stuff, I've never really before that show done like a long narrative hour and like figure it out. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3135.9s)]
*  The reaction from like people who followed me for years and like fans of like our podcasts and stuff was like, this like, I love all your stand up. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3144.9s)]
*  I love all your jokes. I love all the routines. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3153.9s)]
*  This is just different. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3155.9s)]
*  And the fact that there's like a, there's genuine like pieces of you and there's moments where you're not even trying to be funny and you're just talking to us. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3157.9s)]
*  It's a totally different thing. And we want more of that. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3164.9s)]
*  And then with the, so I put a special out in November, the most recent one, and that's a lot more clubby again. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3167.9s)]
*  Because I wanted to just go back out and do what I've done for years. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3171.9s)]
*  I do think the next show I do will probably be another like narrative one. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3175.9s)]
*  I want to like try another story and try and do another thing. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3181.9s)]
*  It's yeah, the way it was received, like when you can really sort of put a piece of you like and be, you know, talk about your actual life and what you actually felt at moments and proper give like give people a real story. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3184.9s)]
*  The reaction to it like, like the special I've just put out, I'm really proud of it. I think it's fucking great. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3199.9s)]
*  A lot of people have messaged me and been like, this is so funny. Fucking love it. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3204.9s)]
*  They're sharing it. This is the best, like the funniest hour stand up I've seen. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3208.9s)]
*  When I was getting messages about Juicy, they were like paragraphs in the DMs. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3211.9s)]
*  Like this, it may be- [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3216.9s)]
*  Stories affect people differently in general. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3218.9s)]
*  Like if somebody walks in the room right now and goes, guys, I got a crazy story. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3220.9s)]
*  We're going to give them about like two minutes of our attention no matter what. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3223.9s)]
*  It's like our earliest form of digesting information. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3226.9s)]
*  Before we could like write shit down, it was just people said, yo, this is kind of wild. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3229.9s)]
*  I mean, the Odyssey, who the fuck remembered that entire story? [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3232.9s)]
*  But we're hardwired to remember these things. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3235.9s)]
*  They have this long form narrative. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3238.9s)]
*  You know, it's like if we wanted little chunks of things, movies wouldn't exist. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3240.9s)]
*  But when you sit down for two hours, it's this one beautiful long story that kind of reflects in a way that our lives are led. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3245.9s)]
*  But mixing things up, I think is important too. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3253.9s)]
*  You got to always keep your fans on their toes. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3257.9s)]
*  I think like once they start expecting something, there can be a little boredom that comes with it. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3259.9s)]
*  But they show up and they see this hour and it's all these punchy jokes and they're like, oh shit, well, that's right. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3264.9s)]
*  Oh, he also does this. Then you hit them next time with something completely different. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3269.9s)]
*  That's what I want to do. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3272.9s)]
*  Like the hour I've just put out, I love doing it. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3274.9s)]
*  I worked with Alfie again, who like helped me with Juicy, like directed it. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3277.9s)]
*  He was also opening for me. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3280.9s)]
*  So he was at a lot of the tour shows being like, hey, you've done this a little different to last night. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3282.9s)]
*  Last night was better. Stuff like that. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3286.9s)]
*  He's really good for that. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3288.9s)]
*  And we shot this most recent one in my like bucket list venue. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3290.9s)]
*  I know like your bucket list venue was MSG. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3294.9s)]
*  And that's why I flew out for that with Carl. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3296.9s)]
*  It was so good to be there for that. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3298.9s)]
*  Thank you, man. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3300.9s)]
*  The first venue I ever seen comedy in was the Liverpool Empire Theatre to British comical Ross Noble. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3302.9s)]
*  And I was 16. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3308.9s)]
*  I just like sort of found out like live comedy was a real thing. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3312.9s)]
*  It wasn't just like something that was on the TV every now and then. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3316.9s)]
*  And I loved it. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3318.9s)]
*  And that was sort of the start of like how I can do this. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3320.9s)]
*  And I remember like when I started, I was like, by the time I'm 30, I want to headline that room. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3322.9s)]
*  By the time I did that, I was 32. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3327.9s)]
*  But the two years for COVID, I'm taking that off. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3329.9s)]
*  And we did like fucking, you know, incredible like hometown sports back home. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3331.9s)]
*  So we did two shows in one night in the Empire Theatre. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3338.9s)]
*  That was nearly 5000 tickets. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3341.9s)]
*  And then later in the tour, we did the arena. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3343.9s)]
*  And I've got the footage from that where, you know, the jokes are a little different and like we can release some clips from that eventually. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3345.9s)]
*  But the special shots to just like the guy like Will, who's like our camera guy, our podcast and like our production company. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3351.9s)]
*  Like he's filmed with me for years now. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3358.9s)]
*  And he knows what I want from a special. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3360.9s)]
*  Like a big thing for me is there's always movements in the shots. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3362.9s)]
*  I never want a camera on a tripod that's like got no one doing this with it. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3365.9s)]
*  Like if it's static, I want a slow zoom. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3368.9s)]
*  And he not only like just got what I wanted, the level to which he's filmed it, the shots, the backdrop, the haze is the perfect. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3370.9s)]
*  Like it's so good. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3382.9s)]
*  The audiences were fucking incredible. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3384.9s)]
*  And I'm so happy. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3386.9s)]
*  I'm happy with how it came out. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3388.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3390.9s)]
*  And I'm really happy with it as an hour to stand up. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3392.9s)]
*  But just as a video, it's yeah. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3394.9s)]
*  You can watch with the sound off and I think you'd like it. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3397.9s)]
*  He shot it so well. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3399.9s)]
*  And I'm so proud. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3401.9s)]
*  Like we did that with my team. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3403.9s)]
*  And that genuinely comes like genuinely from like what you guys do. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3405.9s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3407.9s)]
*  Like watching people like who just go, I'm just going to make it myself. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3409.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3411.9s)]
*  And like I shopped it round and we got a couple of bites and not the bites that I wanted. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3413.9s)]
*  And I was like, it's going on YouTube. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3416.9s)]
*  I want people to see it. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3418.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3420.9s)]
*  And the reason I came out to the States for these two weeks, I wanted to start again where no one really knows me. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3422.9s)]
*  And be going on in comedy clubs where they're like, who the fuck's it? [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3428.9s)]
*  And I've got to win them over again. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3431.9s)]
*  Because like most comedy clubs in the UK, like most comedy clubs in the UK, like I could probably get that a little bit, but they'll always be like 10% or whatever. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3433.9s)]
*  And if I do it in Liverpool at my home club, that's half the room. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3440.9s)]
*  Like, oh, here's Adam. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3443.9s)]
*  So I just wanted to like being in New York and Austin and being like, I'm starting again with clubby stuff for now because we're about to go on like a podcast tour where I've got to do 20 minutes. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3444.9s)]
*  But in the back of my head, I'm making, I'm sitting in cafes all day over here being like, what's this next like long story to give? [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3453.9s)]
*  And it's got to be something real. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3460.9s)]
*  You can't make a story out of nothing. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3462.9s)]
*  No, but like watching you do your show that I don't know how much you spoke about when your special is coming out and whatever. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3464.9s)]
*  Come out, I don't know if we've mentioned it, but basically next month, next month it comes out on Netflix. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3469.9s)]
*  But like I watched you do that twice, once in Manchester, once at MSG. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3474.9s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, you saw the new version in MSG. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3478.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3481.9s)]
*  Because I didn't announce the thing yet. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3482.9s)]
*  But like, there's a, the back half of that special is a story. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3484.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3489.9s)]
*  Like the frontloaded, like you're being shulted and what everyone knows. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3490.9s)]
*  But yeah, there's a, like for people who haven't seen that tour live and they're going to watch the special. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3493.9s)]
*  There's a shift in that hour, isn't there? [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3498.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3500.9s)]
*  From Infamous. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3501.9s)]
*  It's not the same. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3502.9s)]
*  It's not just another album. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3503.9s)]
*  That was the idea. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3505.9s)]
*  I mean, yeah, the idea is I wanted to tell a story and it was not something I'd never done before. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3506.9s)]
*  I also want to be personal. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3510.9s)]
*  Like I never thought my life was interesting enough to be personal. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3511.9s)]
*  You know, and then, you know, this, it was really hard for us to have a kid. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3514.9s)]
*  And then I started talking about on stage and then I started getting those reactions from people. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3518.9s)]
*  And they were like, well, you know, I'm kind of going through the same thing. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3523.9s)]
*  And I was like, oh shit, it's not just me. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3525.9s)]
*  And I started reading all these books about storytelling and like learning like what the structure was and the different arcs that you have to do and the three acts. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3527.9s)]
*  And I was like, okay, maybe I can turn this into a story, but I don't want the audience to think that it's a one man show. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3536.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3542.9s)]
*  Because I always felt like that was a little bit of a, it's like you're asking them to lower their expectations a little. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3543.9s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3549.9s)]
*  So I wanted to start a standup and then turn into this thing and see if I can kind of hold your attention. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3550.9s)]
*  And then the weirdest thing would happen is like you get into the story and like you can just feel the energy. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3557.9s)]
*  Like they're like, where's this going? What's going to happen? [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3562.9s)]
*  And yet I can see why you're compelled to do it again. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3565.9s)]
*  Because once you capture their attention in that way, it feels different. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3569.9s)]
*  If I'm just punch lines. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3573.9s)]
*  If I'm fully honest with you. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3574.9s)]
*  So the most recent special that went out was called What's Wrong With Me. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3576.9s)]
*  And when I first sat down to start writing that I had the exact same sort of plan. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3578.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3583.9s)]
*  I was like, I'm going to front load it with bang, bang, bang, bang. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3584.9s)]
*  And the last 20 minutes is going to be more whatever. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3587.9s)]
*  I'm curious how much of the last 20 is true. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3590.9s)]
*  Like the kid throwing the shoe. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3593.9s)]
*  That's the MRI. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3595.9s)]
*  So we haven't clip that yet. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3597.9s)]
*  So, but we can talk about that. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3599.9s)]
*  That is almost all true. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3600.9s)]
*  Really? [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3604.9s)]
*  But also none of it is. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3605.9s)]
*  None of it is true. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3606.9s)]
*  It's so good. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3607.9s)]
*  This isn't juicy. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3609.9s)]
*  This isn't. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3610.9s)]
*  I'm just saying to protect the area. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3611.9s)]
*  None of it is. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3613.9s)]
*  So I was at the airport. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3614.9s)]
*  So the story at the end of this show, which I thought would be more of a narrative story, sit down, let's have a conversation bit. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3617.9s)]
*  And just as I was doing it on tour and working with Alfie on it. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3627.9s)]
*  Alfie was like, this can just be punchy. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3630.9s)]
*  It's funny enough that we can keep it punchy and it's still interesting. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3632.9s)]
*  And you don't have to slow down quite as much as you did with Juicy. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3635.9s)]
*  So let's just let it be what it's going to be. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3637.9s)]
*  Like let the show choose itself. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3639.9s)]
*  So I like the I'm a bit mental with like health anxiety, like bad hypochondria. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3641.9s)]
*  So like I thought I'm having like heart attacks and strokes before. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3649.9s)]
*  It's like really all consuming at times. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3653.9s)]
*  And for me, I think it's a little bit of a mental problem. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3656.9s)]
*  Like really all consuming at times. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3659.9s)]
*  And for a year, for a year, I didn't get checked for a year, but I had Googled symptoms and I was pretty sure I had multiple cirrhosis, MS. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3661.9s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3674.9s)]
*  Which is not like a death sentence, but severely life-affected. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3675.9s)]
*  It can limit your life, but it's not like you're going to die. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3678.9s)]
*  Whatever. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3680.9s)]
*  And I was sat at the airport waiting to do a show to Belfast. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3681.9s)]
*  And I'd been putting it off because in my head, genuinely, I was like, I don't want to know I've got it because then I've got it. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3686.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3694.9s)]
*  Yeah. You're dead. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3695.9s)]
*  I'd rather think I've got it. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3696.9s)]
*  I feel that a hundred percent. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3697.9s)]
*  I don't think I've got it. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3700.9s)]
*  I avoid that shit. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3701.9s)]
*  So I'm putting it off, but like literally, literally. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3703.9s)]
*  So this is the true measure of the story. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3707.9s)]
*  I would wake up every morning and the first thing my brain would give me was, you got MS. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3709.9s)]
*  Just so you know. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3714.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3715.9s)]
*  What? [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3716.9s)]
*  And then I'm going to sleep at night and it didn't matter, unless I was like hammered and I'd been out with the boys and you just pass out. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3717.9s)]
*  Like if I'm like sober and going to bed and like the room's quiet, my brain would be like, yeah, just go to sleep. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3720.9s)]
*  But you know, you have got MS. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3725.9s)]
*  So just so you know. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3727.9s)]
*  Like it's just constant all the time. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3728.9s)]
*  And like if I was really hungover, all the symptoms got real worse and it was bad. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3730.9s)]
*  And then I'm sat in the airport waiting for this flight to Belfast, which is a 25 minute flight. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3735.9s)]
*  It was delayed by two hours. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3742.9s)]
*  And I'm sat there and there was two people who were obviously also waiting for the same plane. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3744.9s)]
*  And it was a woman and the guy she cares for. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3748.9s)]
*  It was like severely disabled, like like shouty, non control of limbs disabled. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3752.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3760.9s)]
*  And he took, he kept taking his shoe off and throwing it like down the airport, like lounge. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3761.9s)]
*  And I was just really enjoying it. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3768.9s)]
*  It was really funny. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3771.9s)]
*  It was so fun. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3772.9s)]
*  Like I just, for the first time I've seen it, I was like, she's having a bad day. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3774.9s)]
*  Like I think I'm having a bad day waiting for this plane, but like I'm, she's having a bad day. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3778.9s)]
*  And she keeps like putting it back on. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3782.9s)]
*  She's putting it on, she's going, stop it now. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3784.9s)]
*  People are watching us. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3787.9s)]
*  It's not funny. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3788.9s)]
*  Fucking stop it now. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3789.9s)]
*  And then he would sit there and he would just wait a few minutes and he'd take it off again. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3791.9s)]
*  So he like, he'd done it for the entire delay. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3795.9s)]
*  And every time it got funny and in the end I'm like laughing out loud and stuff. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3798.9s)]
*  And then that day genuinely was the day I booked my MRI scan to get tested for MS. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3803.9s)]
*  Because the biggest fear I had, and this is true, was that I wouldn't, if it was going to affect my speech [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3813.9s)]
*  and my ability to hold a microphone and stuff, if it affected my ability to do stand up, [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3820.9s)]
*  which is all I really care about is being able to be a comic. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3824.9s)]
*  That's all I want to be a great comic and that's like my life thing. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3827.9s)]
*  As if it takes that away from me, I won't find it funny. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3830.9s)]
*  I won't find having a disability funny. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3835.9s)]
*  And watching him throw his shoe again and again and again. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3837.9s)]
*  And the fact that every time she told him off, he waited. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3842.9s)]
*  So he knew what he was doing. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3846.9s)]
*  Because otherwise, if he just didn't know, he'd have took it straight off again and threw it again. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3848.9s)]
*  But he was waiting until it was funny again. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3852.9s)]
*  And it didn't matter, but he was like, like that. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3854.9s)]
*  There was a part of his brain that was like, this is hilarious. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3857.9s)]
*  And I was like, if he's seeing the funny side of what he's got, like I'm not going to be that. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3861.9s)]
*  So I've got to be able to find humor in mine. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3867.9s)]
*  And I went and got checked. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3870.9s)]
*  And then it turned out you were gay? [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3872.9s)]
*  I was hungover. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3874.9s)]
*  I was drinking too much. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3875.9s)]
*  That's it. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3877.9s)]
*  Different disease. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3879.9s)]
*  Runs in the family. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3881.9s)]
*  I wonder if you've gotten what that guy had. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3883.9s)]
*  If you guys both think shoe-off is the funniest thing ever, you're like, I got that. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3886.9s)]
*  And you know since I got checked? [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3891.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3893.9s)]
*  Because I haven't really spoken to any of my friends about the symptoms and stuff. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3894.9s)]
*  So I just Googled it and Google goes, you've got MS. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3901.9s)]
*  And I've spoken to mates of mine since and I'm like, oh, it's there. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3904.9s)]
*  And they were like, yeah, I get that too. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3908.9s)]
*  But I know there's been this wave of men need to talk more. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3910.9s)]
*  If we did just have a little guy, we'd be saying to two grandparents. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3914.9s)]
*  You know when you go heavy on a night and you wake up the next day? [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3919.9s)]
*  Do you ever struggle to articulate your words? [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3923.9s)]
*  Oh yeah, you can't think of words. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3926.9s)]
*  On stage, you're like, ah. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3928.9s)]
*  Or do you ever go to speak and you need to swallow your saliva? [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3930.9s)]
*  That you've got to swallow? [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3933.9s)]
*  These are all symptoms of multiple cirrhosis. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3935.9s)]
*  So this is what I was getting to a severe level if I was having a big night. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3938.9s)]
*  And I'm going on stage the next night and I'm having to constantly sip water so that I can get through the set. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3942.9s)]
*  And then I Googled it and I was like, oh, what is it? [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3947.9s)]
*  And it's like, you've definitely got multiple cirrhosis. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3949.9s)]
*  And for a year I was putting it off and I paid a lot of money for a doctor to get it. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3952.9s)]
*  So all these people are out here running 10K for a bunch of alcoholics? [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3955.9s)]
*  I think so. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3961.9s)]
*  And you get up at 6 in the morning and jog in the freezing cold for a guy who had too many drinks. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3962.9s)]
*  Fucking assholes. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3968.9s)]
*  And you're so stressed about it, you're like, you know what will help with this? [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3970.9s)]
*  Alcohol. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3972.9s)]
*  Yeah, having a drink. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3973.9s)]
*  It also is the only thing that helps. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3974.9s)]
*  Because when you're drunk you're like, I don't have it, man. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3976.9s)]
*  I can speak fine. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3979.9s)]
*  I can get my words out really clearly right now. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3981.9s)]
*  Have you been on hypochondria forever? [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3984.9s)]
*  It started about a month after my death of the heart attack. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3986.9s)]
*  So like I had a real, like there was a good few months in, my mum died in September. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3989.9s)]
*  My dad had a heart attack and nearly died in December. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3995.9s)]
*  And a month later I started getting like severe chest pain. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=3998.9s)]
*  And I went to hospital via ambulance, like well into double figures in one calendar month. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4002.9s)]
*  Now in the UK that costs nothing. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4009.9s)]
*  So like over here I probably couldn't have afforded the hypochondria. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4011.9s)]
*  But like in the UK I would turn up and I'd be like, I think I'm having a heart attack again. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4017.9s)]
*  And it'd be like the same nurse. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4021.9s)]
*  And she'd be like, okay cool. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4023.9s)]
*  So they'd hook me up to the ECG machine and they'd like check and then. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4025.9s)]
*  But every time this is what they'd say, they'd go, look, you're 24, you don't smoke, you don't do cocaine. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4029.9s)]
*  You're not going to have a heart attack. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4036.9s)]
*  Like you're not. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4039.9s)]
*  But you could. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4040.9s)]
*  Okay, don't say that. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4043.9s)]
*  So if you get like worse symptoms than you had today, if it feels really different, then come back because then we need to see it. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4044.9s)]
*  And your brain goes, got it. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4051.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4052.9s)]
*  And then the next day I'm like, this feels different to get to you. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4053.9s)]
*  And then back to the hospital. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4056.9s)]
*  You're just regular with the hospital. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4058.9s)]
*  You'd walk up and be like, I'll take the same thing. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4059.9s)]
*  Column 8. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4061.9s)]
*  Room 2. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4064.9s)]
*  Yeah, room 2. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4065.9s)]
*  All right guys, this is a break for a second. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4066.9s)]
*  I want to talk to you about freedom. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4068.9s)]
*  Freedom from exhaustion, freedom from fatigue, freedom from drowsiness, freedom from sleepiness. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4070.9s)]
*  Okay, there's one way that you can do that. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4077.9s)]
*  Coke. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4081.9s)]
*  Now. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4086.9s)]
*  Now that we got our border shut down, that coke is going to be hard to get. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4089.9s)]
*  So how are you going to compensate? [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4093.9s)]
*  You're going to do with another C word. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4094.9s)]
*  Coffee. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4096.9s)]
*  Black rifle coffee to be exact. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4097.9s)]
*  Okay. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4100.9s)]
*  Many people have told me that's the cocaine of coffee. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4101.9s)]
*  A lot of you guys are sniffing unnecessary fentanyl on your nose when you could be slurping on a black rifle coffee. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4104.9s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4110.9s)]
*  Being a proud American. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4111.9s)]
*  Feeling free. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4113.9s)]
*  Not having a caved in nose. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4115.9s)]
*  That's what happens when you're sniffing up all that cocaine and fentanyl coming across the border, which is now shut down. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4118.9s)]
*  Okay. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4124.9s)]
*  If you want to be free of cocaine and fentanyl, but still be awake to stand on that border and see if migrants are crossing, black coffee is the way to do it. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4125.9s)]
*  Okay. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4136.9s)]
*  If you need to be up all night patrolling the border for America, cacao. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4137.9s)]
*  I was waiting for it. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4143.9s)]
*  To make sure. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4145.9s)]
*  I need at least one cacao in every black rifle. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4146.9s)]
*  You make sure if you want to be up. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4149.9s)]
*  I know some of y'all are up all night on cocaine patrolling that border. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4151.9s)]
*  You don't need that anymore. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4154.9s)]
*  You got the black rifle coffee. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4155.9s)]
*  I didn't even know that was possible. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4159.9s)]
*  I just added the cacao in coffee together. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4161.9s)]
*  How did I do that? [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4164.9s)]
*  I had the black rifle espresso with cream and my brain started coming up with unbelievable ideas. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4165.9s)]
*  How do stop abortions? [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4171.9s)]
*  How do. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4175.9s)]
*  Just kidding. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4178.9s)]
*  Just kidding. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4179.9s)]
*  I'm just kidding. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4180.9s)]
*  Al, don't be concerned. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4181.9s)]
*  The point that I'm trying to make is this black rifle coffee right here is going to keep at least 300 migrants outside of your country. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4183.9s)]
*  100% guaranteed. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4189.9s)]
*  This black rifle coffee right here is going to make sure that all of our trade partners bend a knee and kiss the feet. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4191.9s)]
*  Okay. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4198.9s)]
*  If you're slurping down a black rival coffee, you are projecting America into its next golden age of freedom and excellence and mostly workers from America. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4199.9s)]
*  Mostly mostly workers. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4210.9s)]
*  There are no H1B visas at the black rival coffee company. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4213.9s)]
*  I don't know that for a fact, but that's what I assume when I drink this espresso with cream. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4218.9s)]
*  My point is if you go to black rival coffee dot com and use the code flagrant. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4224.9s)]
*  You're going to keep 30% more migrants out of this country and you're going to get 30% off today and see what all the hype is about. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4228.9s)]
*  Let's get back to the show. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4238.9s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a break for a second. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4240.9s)]
*  Listen, everybody knows somebody who is deeply affected by the wildfires in L.A. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4241.9s)]
*  Okay. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4245.9s)]
*  We just had somebody over the studio a couple of weeks ago, lost absolutely everything. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4246.9s)]
*  I've had tons of friends and lost absolutely everything. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4249.9s)]
*  It is incredibly tragic. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4251.9s)]
*  It's one of the worst natural disasters that we've ever experienced here in America. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4253.9s)]
*  I think they said it was something like 250 billion dollars worth of damage. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4257.9s)]
*  There are priceless memories that are absolutely evaporated by that fire. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4260.9s)]
*  Obviously, there's a lot of questions. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4266.9s)]
*  There are claims that insurance companies canceled thousands of homeowners fire policies in the months leading up to the fires. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4268.9s)]
*  Were those cancellations legal? [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4274.9s)]
*  Could this catastrophe have been avoided? [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4276.9s)]
*  Was the city prepared? [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4278.9s)]

*  What's the wildest thing you believed you had? [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4318.9s)]
*  I think MS is hard to top. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4321.9s)]
*  The heart attack stuff was the worst. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4323.9s)]
*  That was a good like 18 months of being completely uncontrollable. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4327.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4330.9s)]
*  And it was definitely tied to, you know, you lose a mom and then like. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4331.9s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4334.9s)]
*  Like this is also how much my family drink. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4335.9s)]
*  This is true. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4339.9s)]
*  So my dad had that heart attack on my little brother's 18th birthday. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4340.9s)]
*  Can we get another beer or two in here for Alan? [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4343.9s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4345.9s)]
*  I want to see some symptoms. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4346.9s)]
*  Have to wait till tomorrow. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4350.9s)]
*  Grab me one too. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4352.9s)]
*  Go on. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4353.9s)]
*  My dad had that heart attack on my little brother's 18th birthday. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4354.9s)]
*  Oh Jesus. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4359.9s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4360.9s)]
*  So I had a set at the comedy club in Liverpool. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4361.9s)]
*  So my little brother was going for a meal in the little village near where we lived, West Arby Village. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4363.9s)]
*  And then was going into the city centre like to go out into the early hours of the morning. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4370.9s)]
*  So I was like, I'll come to the meal. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4376.9s)]
*  I'll quickly run into town, do my set and then I'll come and meet you back at the bar. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4378.9s)]
*  He's like, great. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4382.9s)]
*  So I have the meal. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4383.9s)]
*  I go to town and I'm literally behind the curtain waiting to go on. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4384.9s)]
*  And my phone rings and it's thanks, man. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4388.9s)]
*  It's me little brother. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4393.9s)]
*  And initially I thought I'll just turn this off. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4394.9s)]
*  I was like, there's 15 of him and his friends and what he's probably going to be like is, can you get me into your show? [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4399.9s)]
*  Me and my friends want to watch your set. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4404.9s)]
*  So I thought I'll just fucking button him. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4406.9s)]
*  And you know, I'll see him after the thing. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4408.9s)]
*  But something made me answer the phone. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4412.9s)]
*  Fucking button him. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4414.9s)]
*  Buy a ticket lad. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4416.9s)]
*  And I answered it and he goes, you need to leave the comedy club right now. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4418.9s)]
*  And I was like, I'm not fucking doing that. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4422.9s)]
*  I'm about to go on stage. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4424.9s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4425.9s)]
*  And he goes, my dad's having a heart attack. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4426.9s)]
*  And I was like, what? [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4427.9s)]
*  And I like obviously I don't really remember the next like five minutes, but apparently I just go like white. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4429.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4433.9s)]
*  And so there's another guy that was supposed to go after me. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4434.9s)]
*  He was like, I'll just be like the host's already on. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4437.9s)]
*  They think I'm on. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4439.9s)]
*  And like this passing the no culture in America where it's like someone else is going on. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4440.9s)]
*  That's another thing. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4444.9s)]
*  So the host just goes, Adam Rowe. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4445.9s)]
*  And this other guy, Pete goes on stage and just explains what's going on. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4447.9s)]
*  So I call my dad's phone because Jack's like he's gone to the hospital and the doctor answers. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4453.9s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, he's currently in the Royal Liverpool Hospital, but he's being transferred to Broad Green Heart and Chest Hospital because he is having a heart attack and they need to, you know, they need to operate on him right now. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4461.9s)]
*  So we go to Broad Green Hospital. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4472.9s)]
*  I get there. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4474.9s)]
*  And then my family have sort of heard of it. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4475.9s)]
*  Like they've heard what's going on through my brother and other people. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4478.9s)]
*  So like my auntie or aunt for you guys, her partner, my uncle, and a few cousins and there's a load of us in this little room. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4481.9s)]
*  The first thing, you know, like this is how comedy can really like fix it. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4489.9s)]
*  Awful moments. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4494.9s)]
*  We're all just so sad. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4495.9s)]
*  My dad is like under the knife having the surgery like right now to try and fix what's going on. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4496.9s)]
*  And we're all just like devastated and don't know what to do. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4500.9s)]
*  And my uncle, who's not with us anymore. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4504.9s)]
*  He died a few years ago. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4506.9s)]
*  He was just the most gentle giant in the world, but he was also fucking stupid, like so thick. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4507.9s)]
*  And he goes into the bathroom and he comes back in and he goes, this is a real like fancy hospital list. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4513.9s)]
*  And I was like, what? [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4522.9s)]
*  It's an NHS hospital on the outskirts of Liverpool. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4525.9s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about? [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4527.9s)]
*  And he goes, no, I don't know. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4528.9s)]
*  They make you sign the wall to say you've been and used the toilet. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4530.9s)]
*  And I was like, no, that's the cleaning thing. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4535.9s)]
*  And he'd got a pen. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4538.9s)]
*  Like he just got rid of his cancer. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4540.9s)]
*  No, so you know, on the wall of a bathroom when the cleaner goes in and cleans the bathroom, they have to sign to go 1pm. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4542.9s)]
*  Sheila cleaned the thing. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4549.9s)]
*  There's just like Marie, Marie, Marie, Sheila, Sheila, Sheila, and then just call him. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4550.9s)]
*  And we're all fucking dying laughing at that. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4557.9s)]
*  Another hour ago, my dad's still in the surgery. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4560.9s)]
*  And then this guy comes in and he goes, look, your dad's going to make it. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4563.9s)]
*  He's in a pretty, you know, it was a pretty big cloth that he had and we've got it out. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4568.9s)]
*  It's going to be a long road to recovery, but we're going to bring him past this waiting room you're in now to put him into there. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4573.9s)]
*  But you're not going to be able to see him for a couple of hours just so you know. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4578.9s)]
*  Okay. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4582.9s)]
*  And then about 30 seconds later, we hear like double doors go to the end of the corridor. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4583.9s)]
*  So we're all poking our heads out the door. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4588.9s)]
*  And my dad is being wheeled on a bed, but he is sat up off his fucking head on drugs with thumbs up. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4590.9s)]
*  And I go, are you all right? [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4599.9s)]
*  And he says, I think I'll make last orders. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4601.9s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4605.9s)]
*  Like the last call at the bar. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4606.9s)]
*  That's nice of him to let you guys know, like, hey, don't worry. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4611.9s)]
*  20 minutes later, you can go and see him. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4613.9s)]
*  And my dad was like, so are we leaving? [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4615.9s)]
*  And we were like, you're going to be here for like a week. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4617.9s)]
*  And he's like, I'm fine. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4619.9s)]
*  He was like, you've had a heart attack. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4621.9s)]
*  He's like, yeah, but I'm not anymore. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4622.9s)]
*  It's perfect now. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4625.9s)]
*  He's like a football player with the thumbs up. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4628.9s)]
*  He's getting stretchered off. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4630.9s)]
*  You know, it's kind of nice. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4631.9s)]
*  Let everyone know you're okay. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4632.9s)]
*  Oh, that's wild. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4634.9s)]
*  But he's passed, you said? [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4635.9s)]
*  My uncle has the guy who signed his name on. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4636.9s)]
*  But your dad? [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4638.9s)]
*  My dad's still with us. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4639.9s)]
*  He's like, okay, good shit. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4640.9s)]
*  How old are you now? [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4641.9s)]

*  He was like, you can't take this motherfucker anywhere. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4732.9s)]
*  Oh, no, no, no. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4734.9s)]

*  No, he's not heavy on the booze. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4736.9s)]
*  But if he has like three drinks, he has no ability to control the questions that he asks any people. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4738.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4743.9s)]

*  Now, I've always wanted to ask Derek this one question because I've always thought about [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4957.9s)]
*  the gift baskets because I'm like, hold on. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4960.9s)]
*  There are guys that probably got gifted like a signed baseball from their favorite baseball [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4962.9s)]
*  player by their girlfriend, like a Derek Jeter signed baseball. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4968.9s)]
*  And after that story came out, I always wondered what those dudes thought. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4971.9s)]
*  Like they pick up that baseball and be like, how the fuck did you get this? [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4974.9s)]
*  Can I see the authentication? [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4978.9s)]
*  Where the fuck is this baseball from? [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4980.9s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4982.9s)]
*  And so I could try to like, you know, just calm the situation down. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4983.9s)]
*  I go, yeah, wasn't that funny if a guy said that? [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4986.9s)]
*  And he's just kind of laughing. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4988.9s)]
*  We're all kind of laughing. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4989.9s)]
*  And it goes to sign up for a second. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4990.9s)]
*  He goes, no, but you did that. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4992.9s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4994.9s)]
*  He doesn't start to realize they're getting annoyed and Derek starts going, I mean, you [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=4995.9s)]
*  got to be a fucking idiot to believe that he says fucking idiot to believe that. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5006.9s)]
*  And now he goes, no, you're a man. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5011.9s)]
*  I was one line right that he had fucking in the deck for about 10 years. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5013.9s)]
*  He goes, he goes, ha ha ha. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5021.9s)]
*  Short stuff, more like longstop. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5023.9s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5025.9s)]
*  Vala goes, Vala goes, Vala goes, oh yeah, we're ready to go. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5028.9s)]
*  I've been waiting to say that for 10 years. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5035.9s)]
*  And Jader's just there the whole time. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5037.9s)]
*  And this guy's like a hand over your bro. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5041.9s)]
*  And this is his story of you, bro. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5044.9s)]
*  I know it sucks. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5047.9s)]
*  I'm so embarrassed. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5048.9s)]
*  Derek might have said three different times, you would have to be a fucking idiot to believe [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5050.9s)]
*  that story. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5055.9s)]
*  I think one of the times I was like, this fucking idiot. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5056.9s)]
*  Police. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5059.9s)]
*  And Al always prides himself on being like the coolest guy when he meets people. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5060.9s)]
*  Like anytime someone comes in, I take a picture of them, and Al's always like. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5064.9s)]
*  And you really fucked, like at some point someone's going to like. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5067.9s)]

*  Because the father of four is a businessman now. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5079.9s)]
*  At some point, Derek Jader is going to be sat with one of his friends and one of his [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5082.9s)]

*  But I went to when me and Karl came out to see you at MSG, we went to a Yankee game. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5263.22s)]
*  I really like it. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5268.9400000000005s)]
*  Like not even just the sport. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5270.26s)]
*  The sport's fine. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5271.82s)]
*  It's boring. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5272.82s)]
*  But like the idea of just being sad, not really needing to pay attention with your friend [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5273.82s)]
*  just drinking beer. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5277.3s)]
*  It's just drinking beer. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5278.3s)]
*  But it was fucking empty. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5279.46s)]
*  Really? [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5281.46s)]
*  Was this just like a regular season game against a bum team? [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5282.46s)]
*  So it was against Detroit. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5285.7s)]
*  But I would say 15% of seats taken. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5290.46s)]
*  Yeah, that's surprising. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5293.900000000001s)]
*  I mean, usually the Yankees sell tickets. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5295.18s)]
*  There are teams that it's completely empty. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5296.74s)]
*  Like it looks like it's preseason. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5298.46s)]
*  So what's the point? [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5299.46s)]
*  They play so many games too. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5300.46s)]
*  Yeah, they play 162 games and the TV deals is where they make all the money. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5302.26s)]
*  But I think someone's got to change with baseball. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5306.58s)]
*  I don't think there's the same excitement. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5308.58s)]
*  It's got to. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5309.94s)]
*  Obviously the only sport I really care about back home is our football. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5310.94s)]
*  I can only get a ticket to a Liverpool game because I know enough people who've got like [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5316.82s)]
*  20 of us, we go to every game. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5320.34s)]
*  Sometimes two people can't make it. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5323.42s)]
*  I know enough groups of that that I can normally get one or two tickets. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5324.54s)]
*  Every single game sells out. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5328.78s)]
*  At the start of the season it's all gone. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5329.78s)]
*  Whether we're good or bad. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5331.86s)]
*  When we were there we were just like, we were watching it being like, oh, maybe everyone [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5334.86s)]
*  gets here for the second half. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5337.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5338.74s)]
*  Like for the end and then we got for the second half. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5339.74s)]
*  That's weird. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5342.74s)]
*  I mean, that sounds weird for a Yankee. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5343.74s)]
*  That's because Jeter's not playing. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5344.74s)]
*  Yeah, it's probably. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5345.74s)]
*  No, but even this year they were good. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5346.74s)]
*  Like that's peculiar. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5349.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5350.42s)]
*  Who's the, forgive me for being so like unknowledgeable, who's like the guy right now who's like expected [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5351.42s)]
*  to get a home run? [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5357.5s)]
*  Aaron Judge. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5358.5s)]
*  Aaron Judge. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5359.5s)]
*  So I won some money on him because like her friend of mine was like, get Aaron Judge on [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5360.5s)]
*  for a home run. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5363.9s)]
*  And I think he got one. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5364.9s)]
*  Oh, you, you gambled. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5366.46s)]
*  You, you. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5367.860000000001s)]
*  Oh, I like that. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5368.860000000001s)]
*  You like to put some money down or what? [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5369.860000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5370.860000000001s)]
*  Really? [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5371.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5372.860000000001s)]
*  Is that like. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5373.860000000001s)]
*  Oh, tell me, tell me. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5374.860000000001s)]
*  What is your. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5376.22s)]
*  I'm going to put a grand on the Eagles. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5377.22s)]
*  Really? [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5378.22s)]
*  Well, you know what? [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5379.22s)]
*  If you're gonna, if you're gonna gamble on sports, you got to do it with steak. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5380.22s)]
*  We've changed outfits, but it's important because this week is maybe the greatest week [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5384.26s)]
*  in sports. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5390.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5391.900000000001s)]
*  And by that I mean is another reminder that the Dallas Cowboys are not in the Super Bowl. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5392.98s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I'm broken. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5397.98s)]
*  So I take back everything I said. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5399.5s)]
*  I'm pretty certain the Eagles are going to win because this is just a year that God has [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5401.66s)]
*  decided to make everything I hate happen. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5404.759999999999s)]
*  So the Eagles are going to win the Super Bowl. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5407.36s)]
*  I'm going to throw myself off of whatever fucking bridge. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5409.219999999999s)]
*  I just want to remind you that Akash is having a career year right now. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5411.86s)]
*  OK, this guy's selling out a hundred shows. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5416.86s)]
*  Every single city goes to it's unbelievable what he's doing and he's still upset about [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5420.12s)]
*  his football team. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5426.82s)]
*  Why God, why? [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5427.92s)]
*  That's all I can think to say. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5429.66s)]
*  The point is, if you're going to bet on the Super Bowl, you should not trust Akash because [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5430.84s)]
*  he's been wrong every single week. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5435.72s)]
*  We still trust him, but we're down to lose our money. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5437.32s)]
*  If I was you, I will put that money on them Kansas City Chiefs. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5439.58s)]
*  OK, the last team in the league that still represents Native American. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5442.68s)]
*  OK, there's something very important about that. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5446.5199999999995s)]
*  That is fire. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5449.2s)]
*  That is fire. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5450.2s)]
*  100%. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5451.2s)]
*  OK, and that's why they haven't lost. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5452.2s)]
*  They got the luck of the Natives. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5453.2s)]
*  Simple as that. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5454.2s)]
*  If it was the Washington Redskins, they might be in it. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5455.2s)]
*  Oh, that's probably why they lost. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5458.68s)]
*  I'm just saying. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5460.44s)]
*  They haven't had the best luck. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5461.44s)]
*  Who? [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5462.76s)]
*  The Natives? [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5463.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5464.76s)]
*  I know. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5465.76s)]
*  I think it's more irony. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5466.76s)]
*  They got good luck with them casinos. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5467.76s)]
*  Tell Stanky. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5468.76s)]
*  Hey, Stanky is the leader of the global betting and US social casinos. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5469.76s)]
*  Bet on top sports and political events. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5473.76s)]
*  Use the public gold flagrant for your welcome bonus. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5475.5599999999995s)]
*  All right, I just want to let you know Stanky is definitely owned by 100% Native Americans. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5477.96s)]
*  No, no, it's owned by 100% Natives. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5482.96s)]
*  That's the way it is. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5485.96s)]
*  Natives. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5486.96s)]
*  Natives to where? [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5487.96s)]
*  We do not know. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5488.96s)]
*  But those people are Native to somewhere and that is a fact. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5489.96s)]
*  OK, now let's get back to the show. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5491.96s)]
*  You should go check out the Super Bowl. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5493.72s)]
*  That'd be cool. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5494.72s)]
*  I really want to go to the Super Bowl. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5495.72s)]
*  Like one year. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5497.72s)]
*  I'd love to go. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5498.72s)]
*  That's a good American event. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5499.72s)]
*  Dan, who Dan, the co-host of our podcast, have a word. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5500.72s)]
*  He's like a big, he doesn't care about football, like our football at all, really. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5505.4800000000005s)]
*  But he's a big NFL guy. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5508.4800000000005s)]
*  His team is the Saints, but he doesn't, he's not really that bothered. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5510.0s)]
*  He wants them to win. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5512.8s)]
*  But like he's like, he just loves the game. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5514.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5515.8s)]
*  And he, you know, he's desperate for the Chiefs not to win this. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5516.8s)]
*  He wants to be more interesting than that. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5518.4400000000005s)]
*  And I'm really getting into it. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5520.4400000000005s)]
*  But yeah, like I just love the Sundays watching the NFL in the UK are great because normally [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5522.120000000001s)]
*  Liverpool, if Liverpool play on a Saturday, great. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5527.92s)]
*  If they play early Sunday, I can watch Liverpool play at like lunchtime. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5530.52s)]
*  Oh yeah. All your NFL games are super late. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5533.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, there's one that will start at like 6pm. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5536.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5538.5199999999995s)]
*  So I can go to the Liverpool game, get back, watch the first game. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5539.04s)]
*  Next game is 9.30. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5542.08s)]
*  I'll watch that one. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5543.48s)]
*  And then if I'm not tired and I still want to stay up, there's a one o'clock game and [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5544.48s)]
*  I can be up till 4am. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5547.28s)]
*  And it's just fucking great. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5548.48s)]
*  And every game. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5551.08s)]
*  But it's so easy. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5552.44s)]
*  I know like you've got like a sponsor there, but like it's so much more difficult in the [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5554.4s)]
*  States to gamble than it is in the UK. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5558.719999999999s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5560.04s)]
*  Wait, why? [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5560.919999999999s)]
*  Like the UK, every strip of shops has a bookies on it. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5562.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5566.6s)]
*  Wait, you can't do it digitally though? [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5567.6s)]
*  Yeah, you can. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5568.6s)]
*  I do it on my phone. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5569.6s)]
*  So I mean, they don't operate in the US, so I hope it doesn't affect your sponsor. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5570.6s)]
*  I use a company called Bet365. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5574.28s)]
*  Yeah, he uses Stake. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5575.76s)]
*  Go on. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5577.76s)]
*  He's done everything. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5578.76s)]
*  Stake, Stake. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5579.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5580.76s)]
*  It's so easy. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5581.76s)]
*  But like I'll be watching like a something like I'll have a bet on the game, like the [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5582.76s)]
*  money line of the game or the cover or whatever. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5588.04s)]
*  And like with the with soccer with our football, like I'll have you call it a parlay, we call [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5590.76s)]
*  it an accumulator or an acre. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5594.96s)]
*  Like I'll have like every Prem game, I'll try and whatever. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5596.92s)]
*  If Liverpool are playing something and if Man United are playing, I'll bet against them. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5600.4s)]
*  Like Boxing Day this year, day after Christmas. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5603.76s)]
*  So every year on Boxing Day, me and the lads I went to school with, we still get together. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5606.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's our day. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5611.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5612.24s)]
*  Like Christmas is fine. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5613.24s)]
*  Boxing Day is my day. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5614.24s)]
*  So this year we played golf at 9am. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5616.84s)]
*  By 12 we'd done like half the course, we were like, ah, fuck this, let's go to the pub. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5620.64s)]
*  So we got to the pub after like half the course and we were in the pub until 6pm and then [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5624.860000000001s)]
*  Liverpool played at 8pm. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5631.400000000001s)]
*  But there's games all day. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5632.78s)]
*  So 9am golf after a breakfast with the boys, straight to the pub for lunch with the boys [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5634.22s)]
*  and beers and then Liverpool play in the night. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5638.92s)]
*  And I won about four and a half grand on Boxing Day. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5641.28s)]
*  Wow. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5644.04s)]
*  Man United played Wolves. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5645.04s)]
*  I put like 200 quid on Wolves to beat them. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5646.32s)]
*  At one point Manchester City got a penalty and I bet in that moment on them to miss that [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5648.759999999999s)]
*  penalty and they missed the penalty. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5653.36s)]
*  I bet like a really convoluted thing on the Liverpool game. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5656.599999999999s)]
*  I don't know how you guys do this. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5659.2s)]
*  I get so stressed. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5661.04s)]
*  Like anytime I put money down I'm just like, I can't even watch. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5662.04s)]
*  It makes it so agonizing. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5664.4s)]
*  You can only bet money that if you don't win, you're just like, ah. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5665.4s)]
*  It has to be fun. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5670.4s)]
*  Like people get genuine gambling problems where they're like, ah, my rent relies. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5671.4s)]
*  I'd never ever put money down where I'm not worried about it. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5676.4400000000005s)]
*  And also I set myself a limit at the start of the season. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5680.72s)]
*  I'm like, that's what I've put in my account. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5684.2s)]
*  That's what I'm betting with. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5686.08s)]
*  And anything else I'm betting with the Buc-E's money. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5687.16s)]
*  What does that mean, betting with the Buc-E's money? [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5689.52s)]
*  So like if I, let's say I've put 500 quid in my account and I've won three grand. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5691.84s)]
*  Ah, okay. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5696.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5697.08s)]
*  Then it's their money. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5698.08s)]
*  Like if I put a thousand pound on the Eagles, I'm putting stakes money on the thing. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5699.08s)]
*  And if I win, then great, I get more of stakes money. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5706.72s)]
*  And if I lose, okay, stake, get a bit of their money back. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5708.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5710.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5711.76s)]
*  No, I think that's a good way to look at it. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5712.76s)]
*  It's not my money until the end of the season. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5714.8s)]
*  And at the end of the season, I'll buy a new watch. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5716.28s)]
*  Alex, outside of having that beautiful moment with Derek, how did you enjoy the paddle sort [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5720.360000000001s)]
*  of it? [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5727.0s)]
*  Live and watching professionals? [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5728.8s)]
*  Fire. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5730.12s)]
*  Fire, right? [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5731.12s)]
*  Watching them play? [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5732.76s)]
*  That was fun. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5735.72s)]
*  It's not the same. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5736.72s)]
*  But when you play, you think you're them. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5737.72s)]
*  Like when I, it's like, when I play, I'm like, oh, I'm doing the exact same thing they're [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5739.72s)]
*  doing. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5745.12s)]
*  And then I see videos of it and it just looks like someone's putting it in slow motion. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5746.12s)]
*  Yes, that's what I'm saying. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5748.72s)]
*  It's like sex. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5749.72s)]
*  It really is. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5750.72s)]
*  Like you watch videos, you're like, I'm that guy. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5751.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5752.72s)]
*  And you see yourself, you're like, what the fuck is that? [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5753.72s)]
*  I'm like, you're in a hotel room, you're like, mirroring wall ropes, and you catch yourself, [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5756.72s)]
*  you're like, oh, god. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5759.72s)]
*  What is he doing to that girl? [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5760.72s)]
*  But it's fire though. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5764.68s)]
*  It's a top out. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5766.68s)]
*  You got to get into it, man. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5767.68s)]
*  It is fire. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5769.68s)]
*  It's just incredible. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5770.68s)]
*  Like watching the professionals play, it's so fast and they're so technical. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5771.68s)]
*  Like that is a sport. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5775.280000000001s)]
*  And they stretch out the points for so long. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5777.280000000001s)]
*  Like there's like weird things that like climate effects have, but when it's cold, like the [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5780.76s)]
*  balls are less, the air is I guess more dense, so the ball doesn't fly as much. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5783.84s)]
*  So they can't knock it out as easily. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5789.96s)]
*  So the points would just last forever. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5792.04s)]
*  And you get to see them, I mean, it's just masterful the way they're doing it. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5795.24s)]
*  It's such a weird thing to describe to people because a lot of people don't even know what [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5800.56s)]
*  the sport is. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5804.04s)]
*  Half of the people think I'm talking about fucking pickleball. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5805.04s)]
*  I'm not talking about pickleball. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5806.36s)]
*  What's the difference? [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5808.2s)]
*  So pickleball is basically like ping pong, but you're standing on the table. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5809.2s)]
*  So it's like a smaller tennis court. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5813.04s)]
*  The ball is like this corked thing. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5815.04s)]
*  It's for basically like old people. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5817.6s)]
*  That's the idea. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5820.5199999999995s)]
*  So when I was in school, and I mean like high school, and it's not there anymore, but the [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5821.88s)]
*  school, like playground, the yard, we had what was called, and I've never seen this [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5827.92s)]
*  anywhere else in the world, but I assume it's like an iteration of either pickleball or [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5832.92s)]
*  paddle. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5837.2s)]
*  Paddle tennis? [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5838.2s)]
*  It was sure tennis it was called. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5839.2s)]
*  So it's exactly the same as paddling that you serve towards the back of the court. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5841.36s)]
*  And you serve, but you would serve underarm. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5846.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5848.96s)]
*  Some people call it like lawn tennis or something like that. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5849.96s)]
*  But that was like every, like we used to get two breaks in a day. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5852.320000000001s)]
*  We'd get a break at like 11 and another at one. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5855.200000000001s)]
*  The 11 o'clock break was like 20 minutes and one was an hour. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5857.400000000001s)]
*  And you could buy a bat for five pounds, so maybe like six, seven dollars, from the design [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5861.08s)]
*  departments of the school. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5867.56s)]
*  And you would go home and you would paint your bat, whatever, like you put like an LFC [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5869.120000000001s)]
*  logo on it or whatever. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5872.84s)]
*  But every day we would play this. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5874.56s)]
*  And then I got to like sort of the age of 15, and they changed the school yard and they [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5877.400000000001s)]
*  weren't there anymore. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5881.44s)]
*  And it like that sport just left my head. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5882.44s)]
*  And then about a year ago I see you. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5884.5199999999995s)]
*  I should have the skills still. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5887.24s)]
*  Yeah, I'll keep going. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5888.24s)]
*  This is good. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5889.24s)]
*  So about a year ago I see you posting on like Instagram and I'm like, that looks a bit like [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5890.24s)]
*  an enclosed sure tennis. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5895.08s)]
*  And then two separate groups of friends of mine. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5898.879999999999s)]
*  So there's a venue in Liverpool called Pins Social Club. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5902.48s)]
*  And it's a bar right in the city centre. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5907.679999999999s)]
*  It's got like bowling, table tennis, pool and all that. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5910.28s)]
*  And I run some events there for them as well. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5912.96s)]
*  But the guys who own and run that, they just texted me one day and was like, you ever played [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5914.679999999999s)]
*  paddle? [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5918.48s)]
*  And I was like, no, but why? [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5919.48s)]
*  And they were like, we need an extra player tomorrow. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5920.48s)]
*  I was like, I'll fucking be there. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5922.0s)]
*  And I went and played with them. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5923.0s)]
*  And then my cousin, who like, like we're not as close anymore because we've grown up and [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5924.46s)]
*  stuff, but we were like inseparable as kids because he's only six months older than me. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5927.96s)]
*  So we're like real close age and whatever. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5931.44s)]
*  He texted me and was like, did I see on your Instagram story you were playing paddle? [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5933.639999999999s)]
*  I was like, yeah, I've had a game. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5936.24s)]
*  And he's like, come play with us, we play as well. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5937.24s)]
*  So there's two separate groups. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5939.44s)]
*  And then because of those, like the other lads that I'm mates with, like the podcast [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5940.48s)]
*  boys are like, I'd be up for a little game of that. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5943.48s)]
*  So I think this year. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5945.759999999999s)]
*  There we go. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5946.759999999999s)]
*  This is how it starts, bro. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5947.759999999999s)]
*  And it becomes an obsession, I'm telling you. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5948.759999999999s)]
*  It's like everywhere it's sprouted up, it becomes the dominant sport. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5950.16s)]
*  And I just want everybody to get into it. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5953.919999999999s)]
*  Do people know you out there like as a paddle ambassador? [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5955.679999999999s)]
*  Probably more just from stand up. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5958.679999999999s)]
*  No, that's not true. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5959.96s)]
*  Anybody that's in the paddle space knows. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5960.96s)]
*  That's why. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5963.24s)]
*  Because there just aren't that many people with a following that are playing paddle. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5964.24s)]
*  Like every once in a while the F1 guys play or like a soccer guy plays. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5968.5599999999995s)]
*  And there's this big deal in the paddle world. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5972.12s)]
*  But you don't feel like they're playing obsessively. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5973.96s)]
*  You know, I take lessons in this shit. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5977.5199999999995s)]
*  And the fact that people think it's pickleball is so embarrassing. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5980.12s)]
*  I just imagine going, I have to go to my pickleball lesson. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5982.5199999999995s)]
*  I think when I say it on the podcast. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5985.719999999999s)]
*  But I've got my dementia screen and my denture fit and then my pickleball lesson. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5989.0s)]
*  He was taking us so seriously the day before we're in here, we're working on stuff and [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5993.2s)]
*  we brought a bunch of cookies. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5997.24s)]
*  We're all eating cookies. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5998.24s)]
*  He was like, I can't. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=5999.24s)]
*  I got this paddle tournament. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6000.24s)]
*  I didn't even realize he wasn't playing. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6001.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6002.24s)]
*  He didn't eat cookies to watch. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6003.24s)]
*  That's how serious he takes it. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6006.24s)]
*  You can't be fat watching paddle. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6007.24s)]
*  I'm going to feel bad the numbers. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6008.24s)]
*  He's trying to coach from the sidelines. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6009.24s)]
*  Oh, this is adorable. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6010.24s)]
*  They're not even paying attention to him at all. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6011.24s)]
*  I'm speaking like broken Spanish. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6016.24s)]
*  I'm just yelling now. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6018.24s)]
*  I'm like heckling them a little bit. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6019.24s)]
*  I'm asking the guys on the sidelines like what city they're from in Spain and shit. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6020.24s)]
*  And I'm just like making up things about their city. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6024.24s)]
*  What's the strip club in Málaga? [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6026.32s)]
*  Do it for the booty club. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6029.32s)]
*  Bro, there's a video ball ass. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6032.32s)]
*  I should get the video. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6034.32s)]
*  We're like, I'm just trying to help out. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6035.32s)]
*  And again, I'm not the coach. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6037.32s)]
*  I'm the captain, which is just like me and Derek are some guys that have some notoriety [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6038.32s)]
*  or whatever. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6044.32s)]
*  And they're like, we'll just make you guys like the captains to put some clout on the [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6045.32s)]
*  event. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6049.32s)]
*  We're not supposed to do anything. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6050.32s)]
*  We're not supposed to do anything. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6051.4s)]
*  Because there's no like famous paddle players. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6052.4s)]
*  So they've got like the comedian who does it and then fuck it, let's get a baseball player. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6054.4s)]
*  Most famous guys, right? [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6058.4s)]
*  There's friends with the guy who owns the thing and is the ambassador. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6059.4s)]
*  And but I take my captain role very seriously. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6062.4s)]
*  I'm on the sidelines with them. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6065.4s)]
*  I'm handing waters out. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6067.4s)]
*  They're from like Argentina and Spain. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6070.4s)]
*  Now, Spain is not a third world country. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6072.4s)]
*  It's a first world country kind of. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6073.4s)]
*  This is your country in which we fight. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6075.4s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6078.4s)]
*  But like, but so like you're on the sidelines and they're still doing like third world like [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6079.48s)]
*  techniques to like deal with cramps and shit like they're eating bananas like they're fucking [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6083.2s)]
*  chimpanzees on the sidelines. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6087.08s)]
*  How am I healthy in New York? [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6088.08s)]
*  I'm buying out techniques. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6089.08s)]
*  Get him like a Gatorade pouch or something like that. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6090.08s)]
*  I've never seen a marathon guy run and grab a fucking bushel of bananas and then scarf [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6097.08s)]
*  them during the match. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6102.08s)]
*  A full banana during a match is insane. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6103.08s)]
*  No, tennis players do that all the time. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6105.08s)]
*  During the match? [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6107.08s)]
*  Yes. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6108.08s)]
*  Oh, dude, I had no clue. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6109.76s)]
*  I thought they didn't know about the Gatorade pouch. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6110.76s)]
*  You only have those little energy pouches that you can go get, but Gatorade or something. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6111.76s)]
*  So I'm like, get him some first world shit. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6116.76s)]
*  The guy's on the sideline, dame un platano, un platano. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6118.76s)]
*  I'm like, you want me to go to the grocery store? [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6120.76s)]
*  I don't fucking know. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6122.76s)]
*  I'm getting some banana right now. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6123.76s)]
*  But yeah, I'm like trying to hand him waters. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6124.76s)]
*  They're just ignoring me. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6126.76s)]
*  I'm like, okay. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6127.76s)]
*  I'm so excited. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6128.76s)]
*  I never saw him someplace where it's like he's one of the most famous people there and [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6131.76s)]
*  no one gave a fuck about him on the sideline. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6136.2s)]
*  It was all about the fucking paddle. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6139.4400000000005s)]
*  The player didn't give a fuck. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6141.4400000000005s)]
*  It wasn't until I started making fun of them that they started like... [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6144.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh, he started losing it. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6147.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, because I also think there's like a language barrier. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6148.4400000000005s)]
*  They're not really sure who I am. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6150.4400000000005s)]
*  One guy was calling me Derek and I was like, that's the other captain. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6151.4400000000005s)]
*  These guys have no clue what's going on. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6154.4400000000005s)]
*  And then when I would start teasing them a little bit, I think they were like, oh, okay, [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6157.4400000000005s)]
*  he doesn't really think he's the coach. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6160.4400000000005s)]
*  In paddle, remind me, because I have not played that many games yet. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6162.4400000000005s)]
*  So like how's the scoring work? [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6165.4400000000005s)]
*  So it's just like tennis, like 15, 30, 40 and then game. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6168.12s)]
*  How many games do you think you'd have to play against like the guy who won to win one game? [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6172.12s)]
*  No, it doesn't matter. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6177.12s)]
*  No, he would wear out. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6180.12s)]
*  He would wear out. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6181.12s)]
*  He would like give up. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6182.12s)]
*  He would so would he. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6183.12s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6184.12s)]
*  He would want to win so bad. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6185.12s)]
*  This is how I honestly believe this to my core. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6186.12s)]
*  Two of us could play against one of them and then he would still win. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6189.12s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6194.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6195.12s)]
*  We would play against one and we could hit at any part of the court we want and they [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6196.8s)]
*  would still win and we wouldn't get a game out. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6200.0s)]
*  As long as when we served, we would have to serve into the same spot every single time. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6202.0s)]
*  Like, they're just unbelievable. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6207.0s)]
*  I didn't realize the difference. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6210.0s)]
*  It was that far, but it's far. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6213.0s)]
*  No, it's just everything looks so easy. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6215.0s)]
*  But I really hope people go check it out and play. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6218.0s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6220.0s)]
*  It'll drive your wife crazy. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6221.0s)]
*  My wife hates it. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6223.0s)]
*  She hates how much I love it. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6224.0s)]
*  She loves you having fun. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6225.88s)]
*  I'm having so much fun. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6226.88s)]
*  It's interesting because when she has fun doing things that don't involve me, I'm like [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6227.88s)]
*  really happy for her. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6231.18s)]
*  Because you've got a break. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6232.18s)]
*  Because I get to play. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6233.18s)]
*  All roads lead to battle. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6234.18s)]
*  But when I go to play battle, she's furious about that for some reason. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6236.18s)]
*  And she's like, I'll play with you. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6239.18s)]
*  And I'm like, no, you won't. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6241.18s)]
*  I'll beat you. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6242.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6244.18s)]
*  It's crazy how they're built like that, right? [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6247.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6249.18s)]
*  You're retarded. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6250.18s)]
*  So you have a career that keeps you out every weekend and at night. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6251.360000000001s)]
*  And now you pick a sport that you're playing all the time during the day that you have [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6257.62s)]
*  to be away for like two or three hours at a time. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6262.06s)]
*  So now you're just never... [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6264.9800000000005s)]
*  When's he supposed to play paddle if he's going to be working overnight? [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6265.9800000000005s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6268.38s)]
*  But that's why she hates it. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6269.38s)]
*  You can't pick at nighttime. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6270.38s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6271.38s)]
*  But here's what I say. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6272.38s)]
*  That's why she hates it. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6273.38s)]
*  When I'm playing paddle in the morning, I'm not out partying at night. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6274.38s)]
*  So it's actually the best thing for her. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6276.68s)]
*  Also, if I play golf, that's like four, five, six hours. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6277.9800000000005s)]
*  I pick a sport that's only like two or three. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6280.3s)]
*  You're welcome. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6281.900000000001s)]
*  I play golf as well. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6282.900000000001s)]
*  See? [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6283.900000000001s)]
*  I do both. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6284.900000000001s)]

*  And he has domestic disputes a lot. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6286.900000000001s)]
*  He's had a spiffy relationship in five years right now. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6287.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but this is the good one. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6292.900000000001s)]

*  I'm like, what the fuck is going on? [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6305.42s)]
*  Does she not go, hey, you can't do this? [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6308.42s)]
*  We did Christmas days together. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6310.7s)]

*  No, wait, he said probably working. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6323.7s)]
*  He had no idea what the fuck she was doing. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6324.7s)]
*  She doesn't know what you guys are doing. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6325.7s)]
*  She's got a gift basket or some shit. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6326.7s)]

*  This is how much she loves going to the pub. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6330.7s)]
*  We didn't even finish the golf match. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6331.7s)]
*  I don't even remember the stories. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6332.7s)]
*  We played half, we said, fuck it. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6333.7s)]
*  Golfing is about drinking. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6334.7s)]
*  You're like, let's just stop the golf part. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6335.7s)]
*  We were drinking on the course, we talked teams. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6336.7s)]
*  Oh, you're allowed to do that, right? [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6337.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6338.7s)]
*  That's a part of it. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6339.7s)]
*  Is golfing, like, I know you're super rich now that you're a successful big time comedian, [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6340.7s)]
*  but golf in America is like a rich, rich, rich, rich, rich, rich, rich, rich, rich, rich, [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6345.7s)]
*  rich, rich, rich, rich, rich, rich, rich, rich, rich, rich, rich, rich, rich, rich, rich, rich, [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6350.7s)]
*  Is golfing, like, I know you're super rich now that you're a successful big time comedian, [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6354.7s)]
*  but golf in America is like a rich person sport. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6358.7s)]
*  It is. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6361.7s)]
*  Is it middle class as well? [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6362.7s)]
*  It's sort of seen as that in the UK, but like, like I played golf when I was a teenager and [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6363.7s)]
*  we had fucking no, like nothing. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6369.7s)]
*  So you can be middle class, you can be normal and play golf. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6371.46s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, totally. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6374.7s)]
*  In America, that's not the case. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6375.7s)]
*  Like a set of golf clubs for like a beginner set that aren't very good will set you back [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6377.7s)]
*  like, I don't know, £300. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6381.86s)]
*  Wow. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6382.86s)]
*  Well, like second hand, you'd probably go for a hundred. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6383.86s)]
*  So like you could start like with very little money and then to get onto like a publicly [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6385.86s)]
*  owned course, you're paying like £20 to play a game. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6391.58s)]
*  Oh, that's not bad. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6394.86s)]
*  Like a really good, a really good course will cost you hundreds and really good golf clubs [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6395.86s)]
*  will cost you thousands. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6401.66s)]
*  That's the thing in America, it's like a quarter million dollars to join a golf club. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6402.66s)]
*  It's a country club. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6405.66s)]
*  It's nowhere near that. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6406.66s)]
*  Or a million sometimes. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6407.66s)]
*  Yeah, it's nowhere near that. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6408.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6410.259999999999s)]
*  Around the city, it's like a lot harder. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6411.66s)]
*  This is a different, like in Florida, I grew up playing golf, like very middle class golf. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6413.66s)]
*  Got it. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6417.46s)]
*  Where there's more land, you have more golf courses and then it's a little bit more accessible. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6418.46s)]
*  I have like middle class friends that live on golf courses. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6421.46s)]
*  They have like very regular lives and they're on like the 18th and like so random. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6424.46s)]
*  I want to play that course. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6428.06s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6430.26s)]
*  That's what my brother does every week. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6431.26s)]
*  He plays in Castle Dagger. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6432.66s)]
*  Have you played before? [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6434.06s)]
*  Yeah, I have them horrible. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6435.06s)]
*  But I love the idea that there's like projects surrounding the golf course. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6436.06s)]
*  Yes. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6439.26s)]
*  There was one course where it was just a links course. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6441.26s)]
*  So it was just like nine holes or whatever. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6443.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6445.26s)]
*  And it was just in the hood. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6446.26s)]
*  And then you would just get random people going to play. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6447.26s)]
*  That's fine. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6450.26s)]
*  And they wouldn't really take care of the greens. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6451.26s)]
*  It was just all overgrown and shit. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6452.26s)]
*  So a lot of the publicly owned courses in like Liverpool are a bit shit and then there's [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6454.26s)]
*  like the middle ones. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6457.26s)]
*  The middle ones are normally the ones that I'll play and they're good. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6458.26s)]
*  But I've played like good courses a handful of times. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6461.26s)]
*  And like what these like professionals are playing on, like I seen a video the other [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6464.26s)]
*  week and it was like, do you think you could win the U.S. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6467.26s)]
*  Open if you started on the green? [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6470.26s)]
*  That's a great that's a great. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6474.26s)]
*  What's it called? [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6476.26s)]
*  OK. And the answer is no. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6477.26s)]
*  No. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6478.26s)]
*  Do you know what he's asking? [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6479.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6480.26s)]
*  But like the green is close to the hole, right? [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6481.26s)]
*  The green is the patch with the shortest. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6484.26s)]
*  So you couldn't win? [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6486.26s)]
*  The green could be between the size of this room and four times the size of this room, [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6488.26s)]
*  depending on the hole. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6492.26s)]
*  OK. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6493.26s)]
*  And you start on every green. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6494.26s)]
*  That would be a great fucking matchup. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6495.26s)]
*  You get the best golfer in the world and then you get me. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6497.26s)]
*  You actually play golf. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6500.26s)]
*  But me and Al, guys who don't play golf, and we start on the green and they start at the [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6503.26s)]
*  tee and we play 18. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6507.26s)]
*  They beat you by between 30 and 50 shots. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6510.26s)]
*  It's like putting on the hand tights. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6518.26s)]
*  And I might be being really nice as well. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6520.26s)]
*  But no, but we played mini golf. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6522.26s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6524.26s)]
*  I'm good at that puck punch shit. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6525.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6527.26s)]
*  Until you can read a green. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6528.26s)]
*  So like the best course I've ever played on was about six months ago with a friend of [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6530.26s)]
*  mine called Thomas called the Shire. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6534.26s)]
*  It's about an hour outside of London. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6535.26s)]
*  And there's a practice green at the start of the course for you to just like practice [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6537.26s)]
*  putting before you tee off. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6541.26s)]
*  And I dropped the golf ball from just the height and it just went its own way and then [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6543.26s)]
*  rolled off the green. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6551.26s)]
*  And if you tap it, it will go. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6553.26s)]
*  But these pro golfers can look at a green and see if they drop the ball here exactly [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6555.26s)]
*  where it's going to end up. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6560.26s)]
*  And that's what you're playing against. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6562.26s)]
*  And you just be looking at a green going right here. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6563.26s)]
*  The hole's there. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6565.26s)]
*  I'll hit it that way. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6566.26s)]
*  But what you actually need to do is hit it over there so that it does that. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6567.26s)]
*  And they know how to do that. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6570.26s)]
*  You'd go that way and then you'd be then you'd be off the green. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6572.26s)]
*  No, I'd figure that out. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6575.26s)]
*  I'd figure that out. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6577.26s)]
*  This doesn't sound right at all. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6578.26s)]
*  Tour greens would be even harder. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6580.26s)]
*  If you're playing against actual tour players, they're playing on greens that are faster [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6582.26s)]
*  than what you played. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6585.26s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6586.26s)]
*  It would. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6587.26s)]
*  It's like it's like, I was talking to one of these guys. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6588.26s)]
*  It's because a lot of guys that play tennis are now like kind of playing a paddle. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6591.26s)]
*  And there's this one guy, Willie Conyers, was his name. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6595.26s)]
*  He beat Federer like three times. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6598.26s)]
*  He's like, I think number eight of the world at one point in time. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6599.26s)]
*  And he was saying like how the game of tennis changed. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6602.26s)]
*  I had no clue that they were changing the greens like they were making it slower, making [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6604.26s)]
*  it faster and they're changing the game to make it more friendly for TV, essentially [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6608.26s)]
*  changing the density of the ball. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6614.26s)]
*  They made it green. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6616.26s)]
*  They made the change of color, but they're also changing like the size of it. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6618.26s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6622.26s)]
*  So I think what happened was there was a time like have you ever seen that thing, that [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6623.26s)]
*  picture of the of what the what the grass tennis courts call it, I guess, this grass [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6626.26s)]
*  lawn. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6632.26s)]
*  Yeah, lawn. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6633.26s)]
*  So what the lawn test was and how they've changed over the years, like which paths have [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6634.26s)]
*  been used up in the last few years, like which patches are the most used up. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6637.26s)]
*  So back in the day when the game was at the net, you would see it all chopped up. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6640.26s)]
*  And now the game is almost never at the net. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6644.26s)]
*  They're both behind the line and they're both ripping it. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6646.26s)]
*  And it's because they've changed the game to make it more exciting to extend the volleys. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6648.26s)]
*  When we were growing up, the guys, it would just be a hard serve because the greens were [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6651.26s)]
*  so fast and then maybe one or two shots point went in. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6654.26s)]
*  So they changed the game to make it more enjoyable for TV. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6657.26s)]
*  I don't think that this is a coincidence at all outside of the Williams sisters being [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6661.26s)]
*  like superstars. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6665.26s)]
*  The women's game picks up at the same time that the men's game is just serve and then [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6666.26s)]
*  done. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6671.26s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6672.26s)]
*  Because the women don't have the power. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6673.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6674.26s)]
*  So the rallies are much longer and the game is more interesting. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6675.26s)]
*  Watching women is better than watching the men. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6677.26s)]
*  It's so much better. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6679.26s)]
*  And like the women technically get paid more. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6680.26s)]
*  Wait, what do you mean? [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6683.26s)]
*  Oh, because they play less. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6684.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6685.26s)]
*  So the prize money for men's and women's Wimbledon is the same, but men is best of seven sets [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6686.26s)]
*  and women is best of five. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6691.26s)]
*  So look at the greens. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6692.26s)]
*  That's right. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6693.26s)]
*  Or it might be three. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6694.26s)]
*  Look how much of the area where you would volley has eroded. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6695.26s)]
*  And this is in 2024. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6700.26s)]
*  There's almost nothing. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6701.26s)]
*  Same exact course. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6702.26s)]
*  And everybody's just behind the line. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6703.26s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6704.26s)]
*  They do this with a lot of sports like baseball. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6705.26s)]
*  They eliminated the shift. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6708.26s)]
*  You used to have like the dead ball era of basketball in the early 2000s when they were [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6709.26s)]
*  at. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6714.26s)]
*  That was when they allowed. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6715.26s)]
*  They basically like allowed defenses to be different with like hand checking things to [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6716.26s)]
*  stop Shaq. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6720.26s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6721.26s)]
*  Like the hack shack rule that changed. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6722.26s)]
*  Like this happens to make the sport better. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6723.26s)]
*  Corked bats and stuff like that was the whole thing. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6726.26s)]
*  Well, that was you never that was like you're not supposed to do it. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6728.26s)]
*  But like baseball has changed a lot to make it. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6730.26s)]
*  But you should. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6732.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6733.26s)]
*  Because then the guys end up making more money. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6734.26s)]
*  And that's the thing about these sports like tennis is like we know about the top 20 guys [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6735.26s)]
*  that are making lots of money. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6739.26s)]
*  The other like 400 or 500 are not making lots of money. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6740.26s)]
*  They're like pros at the local country clubs or whatever. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6743.26s)]
*  So you want the prize money to go up. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6746.26s)]
*  But is it you should manipulate the game? [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6748.26s)]
*  I'd be pissed though. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6750.26s)]
*  Right. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6751.26s)]
*  Like if you get great at a game, then they change. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6752.26s)]
*  And you're like, what the fuck? [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6753.26s)]
*  I asked him about that. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6754.26s)]
*  And he goes, because I think there was a moment where his skill set works for what was happening. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6755.26s)]
*  And I think he could really I think it was what's called like a pusher where basically [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6762.26s)]
*  you could defend. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6766.26s)]
*  You just get to every single ball. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6767.26s)]
*  You just exhaust them. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6768.26s)]
*  You just get to every single ball. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6769.26s)]
*  You just exhaust it. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6770.26s)]
*  And then the game change, it might have moved out of his skill set. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6771.26s)]
*  He's like, yeah, you got to be able to adapt. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6773.26s)]
*  Like, that's the nature of this. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6775.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6776.26s)]
*  You're going to be great at any sport. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6777.26s)]
*  You can't be great at that tiny bit of the sport. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6778.26s)]
*  And it's like, oh, well, you've sort of made it harder for me to use that. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6781.26s)]
*  It's like, well, then you were a tennis player. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6784.26s)]
*  You were that guy. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6785.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6786.26s)]
*  Like you've got to be good at the whole. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6787.26s)]
*  You got to be able to get around the whole thing. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6789.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6791.26s)]
*  Like with football, like the game changes every sort of like five to 15 years. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6792.26s)]
*  Like a new coach comes in and is like, they cry a little less. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6797.26s)]
*  We'll play like this. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6801.26s)]
*  At the minute, the game's very like possession based for the top teams. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6805.26s)]
*  Like we're going to keep the ball until you make a little mistake and the wrong [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6808.26s)]
*  player runs with us and then we'll find that guy. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6811.26s)]
*  But like that's about I think that's about to change again. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6813.26s)]
*  Like pace is pace is not quite as important now for the best teams because when [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6817.26s)]
*  when there's a game of football and you've got like the full pitch and you know, [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6824.26s)]
*  a team who's bad against a really good team will just line up right in front of [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6828.26s)]
*  their own goal. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6833.26s)]
*  So there's very little space in between the lines for them to find. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6834.26s)]
*  So like this team's fast players don't get to utilize their pace very much because [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6836.26s)]
*  they neutralize the pace. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6841.26s)]
*  Where are we going to run from crowd in the box? [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6842.26s)]
*  So then the best teams want the best technically gifted players because they can [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6844.26s)]
*  find the spaces in between this rather than trying to run through it. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6847.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6851.26s)]
*  I stopped that crying shit. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6853.26s)]
*  But when they get here, yeah, when they get faker, they got to stop. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6855.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6859.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6860.26s)]
*  I don't know how you curb that. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6861.26s)]
*  I mean, they need to do more yellows for guys that don't actually. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6862.26s)]
*  That's what they do in the NBA. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6865.26s)]
*  You get a flagrant for flopping. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6866.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6868.26s)]
*  That's what they need to do. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6869.26s)]
*  You get booked for diving in football. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6870.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6872.26s)]
*  Rarely though. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6873.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6874.26s)]
*  But because for it to be a diver has to be you weren't touched and you're faking it. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6875.26s)]
*  But if they touch them at all, it's like, oh, maybe it did hurt them that much. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6879.26s)]
*  Maybe he's just this guy. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6884.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6886.26s)]
*  Maybe you're a pussy. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6887.26s)]
*  I have a couple of questions. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6889.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6891.26s)]
*  I really like British comedians. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6892.26s)]
*  I'm like a big fan of British comedians. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6893.26s)]
*  Is there anyone new and like sort of upcoming that you're like, oh, you should check him [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6895.26s)]
*  out? [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6899.26s)]
*  We spoke about Jamie last time we were here, the guy who's autistic brother beats him up. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6900.26s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6904.26s)]
*  So Jamie. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6905.26s)]
*  Dr. Catford. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6906.26s)]
*  Yeah, Dr. Catford. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6907.26s)]
*  So Jamie is like well on the rise and he like he's not got any stand up available online. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6908.26s)]
*  All of his clips are podcasts. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6913.26s)]
*  And his idea with that is you've got to see me live or you don't get to ever see what I [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6914.26s)]
*  do. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6918.26s)]
*  And he's very like different on stage and he's very aggressive with the audience. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6919.26s)]
*  It's almost clowning. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6923.26s)]
*  And that like it's like there's substance to it. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6925.26s)]
*  It's not just clowning. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6929.26s)]
*  It's stand up as well. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6930.26s)]
*  But like you'll get right in audiences faces and it's you know, there's levels to it. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6931.26s)]
*  And he's like, I don't think that translates to video. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6936.26s)]
*  So I'm not doing it. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6938.26s)]
*  And he's just sold a lot of tickets on a tour. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6939.26s)]
*  That's dangerous. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6942.26s)]
*  He's doing real well. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6943.26s)]
*  I'm not in the clubs as much at the minute because I've been touring for a good few years [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6945.26s)]
*  and I've took a little break since I put the special out. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6951.26s)]
*  I'm starting again now. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6954.26s)]
*  So I can only really tell you about. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6955.26s)]
*  Do you know what? [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6958.26s)]
*  Actually, there's a lad who's a friend of mine called Elliot Steele. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6959.26s)]
*  And Elliot's good mates with a couple of US comics because he's really good mates with [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6962.26s)]
*  Daniel Sloss, who's got like a career out here as well and stuff. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6966.26s)]
*  Elliot I met when he was 17 and I thought he was fine. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6969.26s)]
*  I was like, ah, you're fine. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6972.26s)]
*  He's a good friend of mine, but I was like, he's fine. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6973.26s)]
*  He's not a great comic, but he's fine. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6975.26s)]
*  And then about 18 months ago, maybe a year ago, I was in London for some like work stuff [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6977.26s)]
*  and I was like, I'm going to just go to the comedy club and do some spots. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6983.26s)]
*  And I had to follow him and I watched him and I was like, oh, you've been working really [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6988.26s)]
*  hard. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6994.26s)]
*  And he's just an absolute. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6995.26s)]
*  And he's not just, he's not just killing with like easy stuff. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6996.26s)]
*  He's really, he's in like a really young liberal London comedy club and he's really [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=6999.26s)]
*  provoking them, but in a really brilliant way. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7006.26s)]
*  So that was really good for me to see that because it was a friend of mine who, to be [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7009.26s)]
*  honest, like I was like, oh, I just think he's okay when I met him. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7012.26s)]
*  He was a fucking kid, you know, he was 17. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7014.26s)]
*  And he's now mid 20s and he's going to be very, very, very good. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7017.26s)]
*  Yeah, I think those two for me, they're the first two that have come to my head. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7024.26s)]
*  I'm actually, I'm curious the amount of times you come to the US, you're here multiple [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7028.26s)]
*  times a year. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7031.26s)]
*  Is there anything about America or Americans that still surprises you? [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7032.26s)]
*  No, not surprises. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7035.26s)]
*  I mean, I feel like I've got a pretty good handle on it. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7037.26s)]
*  Like, I also feel like I see things coming and stuff and yeah, not particularly surprising. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7039.26s)]
*  That's kind of nice. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7046.26s)]
*  Now you're like, oh, you're fit in. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7047.26s)]
*  But even going to Texas, you're not like, whoa, this is not what we know. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7049.26s)]
*  No, but I feel like. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7052.26s)]
*  Okay, here's something that might, maybe you can explain that is along the same line. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7053.26s)]
*  That is along the same thing. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7057.26s)]
*  Okay. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7058.26s)]
*  Robbie Williams. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7060.26s)]
*  Chrissy D was asking me about this. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7063.26s)]
*  Look, he's super famous. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7066.26s)]
*  That's a great point. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7068.26s)]
*  Who's Robbie Williams? [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7069.26s)]
*  Okay, so here's Robbie Williams. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7070.26s)]
*  You haven't even heard any of this yet? [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7072.26s)]
*  So Robbie Williams did an iconic episode of MTV Cribs. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7074.26s)]
*  He had a song where he was like taking off his skin and like his muscles. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7079.26s)]
*  Do you remember the music video for that? [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7083.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7084.26s)]
*  And he's this like pop sensation from the UK that has on paper everything that you need to succeed in America. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7085.26s)]
*  And for whatever fucking reason, he just didn't cross over. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7093.26s)]
*  Yeah, because he's very, very, very British. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7098.26s)]
*  So there's a British pop. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7102.26s)]
*  We like British things. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7103.26s)]
*  We like Idris Elba. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7104.26s)]
*  We like James Bond. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7105.26s)]
*  We like Ricky Gervais. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7107.26s)]
*  We like Ricky Gervais. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7109.26s)]
*  I can't tell you why. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7111.26s)]
*  I don't know whether it's just I can't get my finger on it. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7112.26s)]
*  But like I wouldn't expect Robbie Williams to be big here. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7114.26s)]
*  And I know that he isn't now because of this movie that's come out. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7117.26s)]
*  So what is the movie? [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7120.26s)]
*  Okay, go. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7122.26s)]
*  Breakdown Robbie Williams, then we'll get to the movie. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7123.26s)]
*  He's a pop star. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7124.26s)]
*  He was in a boy band called Take That. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7125.26s)]
*  He was seen as like the entertainer, like the one a lot of women fancy because he was like the naughty boy of the group. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7128.26s)]
*  He wasn't the talented one of the group. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7134.26s)]
*  The talented one was the lead singer who wrote all the songs called Garry Barlow. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7136.26s)]
*  And then when Take That sort of, you know, had that boy band thing where one of them is going to go and do their own thing and they're going to break up and whatever. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7140.26s)]
*  Robbie Williams became like the guy. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7148.26s)]
*  He was the solo star. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7150.26s)]
*  So when he gave him like 80 million for like three albums and that was like back in the 90s or the early 90s. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7151.26s)]
*  So it was a big fucking deal. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7157.26s)]
*  So like he was like the guy. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7159.26s)]
*  Big tours and very famous. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7161.26s)]
*  And like you could stop anybody on the street to the UK and be like, do you know Robbie Williams? [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7163.26s)]
*  And they say, yeah, like he's that level of fame. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7167.26s)]
*  He hasn't like been massively in the public eye for a few years because he got 80 million for three albums. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7169.26s)]
*  So he's had a sit down. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7175.26s)]
*  But there's a movie that's come out this year and it's called Better Man or something like that. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7177.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7187.26s)]
*  And it's it's his sort of life and career story. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7188.26s)]
*  But for no apparent reason, he is a monkey in it. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7192.26s)]
*  Nobody else is. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7199.26s)]
*  Two hours, your ass is mine. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7201.26s)]
*  To be honest, I don't want to rock. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7203.26s)]
*  So let's take it from the top. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7206.26s)]
*  DJ, cause you make me feel so. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7208.26s)]
*  So you know the song? [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7211.26s)]
*  Of course I know Robbie Williams. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7212.26s)]
*  I've never heard that. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7214.26s)]
*  But this is no way. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7215.26s)]
*  Why? [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7218.26s)]
*  The entire film is told from the perspective that he's a chimp. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7219.26s)]
*  And then is anybody acknowledging the fact that he's a. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7223.26s)]
*  No, it's never blow us up once. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7226.26s)]
*  No one else is a chimp. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7228.26s)]
*  This is either genius or fucking idiotic. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7229.26s)]
*  We're talking about it. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7232.26s)]
*  We're talking about it. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7233.26s)]
*  So the movie bombed here. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7234.26s)]
*  Oh, it came out already. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7236.26s)]
*  So Universal bought the rights to it in America. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7238.26s)]
*  And these numbers will not be accurate. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7240.26s)]
*  But it's essentially like they paid a hundred million for the rights and they got like five million back. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7242.26s)]
*  Oh, I thought it made like two hundred dollars. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7247.26s)]
*  Like I thought it was like, and I'm not even being facetious. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7250.26s)]
*  I thought it was like less than a thousand dollars opening weekend. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7252.26s)]
*  But it seems like that's part of the marketing. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7256.26s)]
*  But did it do well over there? [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7259.26s)]
*  It's done fine. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7261.26s)]
*  I mean, cinema is not doing very well anyway. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7262.26s)]
*  Like the big movies that like are being pushed. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7264.26s)]
*  I know a few people have seen it and being like, it's what you think it is. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7267.26s)]
*  Is the movie good? [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7272.26s)]
*  Like, is the story good? [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7273.26s)]
*  I haven't fucking seen it. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7275.26s)]
*  It's Robbie Williams life story and he's a fucking. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7277.26s)]
*  Oh, sorry. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7279.26s)]
*  The opening weekend was eighteen thousand dollars. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7280.26s)]
*  Holy shit. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7282.26s)]
*  Yeah, point nine percent of its total gross. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7285.26s)]
*  Yeah, it's now pulled in one point two million, I think. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7290.26s)]
*  They took a risk. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7294.26s)]
*  No, it's such a like you take a risk. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7297.26s)]
*  But you know what it is? [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7300.26s)]
*  You know, like when I imagine you've had meetings like this where like you meet with TV people. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7301.26s)]
*  And now because everything's like no one's watching movies and stuff. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7305.26s)]
*  Robbie Williams has gone in and gone, hey, I'm ready to tell my life story. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7309.26s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, Robbie, it's just not new. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7312.26s)]
*  It's not interesting. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7314.26s)]
*  He's like, what if I'm a monkey and they're like, fuck it. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7315.26s)]
*  We need something interesting. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7319.26s)]
*  Make me a fucking monkey then. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7320.26s)]
*  And the idea is like, oh, I'm less evolved than other people. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7322.26s)]
*  Like I'm more primitive or something. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7324.26s)]
*  I think the idea of it is he's just like, you know, the whole old adage of like, oh, you're just like a dancing monkey. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7326.26s)]
*  Like you're not like, oh, you're just like, you're not a person. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7331.26s)]
*  You're just a fucking go and do the thing for us. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7336.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7338.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7339.26s)]
*  I think that's what it is. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7340.26s)]
*  And does he become a real boy at the end? [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7341.26s)]
*  I don't think so. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7342.26s)]
*  I think he's just a monkey. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7344.26s)]
*  He gets kissed by Jimmy Saville. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7345.26s)]
*  It's beautiful actually. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7348.26s)]
*  Then. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7349.26s)]
*  Fucking out. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7352.26s)]
*  Wild movie, dude. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7353.26s)]
*  Fucking out. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7354.26s)]
*  OK, so when are you back in town? [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7355.26s)]
*  Adam, I know you leave tomorrow. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7356.26s)]
*  I think I'll probably come back into town in like April or May and do some more spots and some spots or shows. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7358.26s)]
*  Have you toured here actually? [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7365.26s)]
*  I haven't toured here yet. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7366.26s)]
*  So you have any interest in doing like traditional club weekends and like doing the American comic thing? [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7367.26s)]
*  Probably not. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7374.26s)]
*  OK. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7375.26s)]
*  What I would like to do out here is I really like the relationship I have with the US right now in that I've done the sort of guest spots and the trials at the clubs. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7376.26s)]
*  And when I'm coming out there, you know, they'll throw me up and that's nice. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7386.26s)]
*  And then because of people like you and other guys who've had me on the podcast and stuff, I'm slowly sort of like I did like Tommy Pope and Chris's podcast. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7390.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7398.26s)]
*  And there's comments on it going off. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7399.26s)]
*  Stuff I like. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7400.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7401.26s)]
*  It was funny. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7402.26s)]
*  They're really good guys. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7403.26s)]
*  Shout out both of them, man. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7404.26s)]
*  I like that. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7405.26s)]
*  And eventually I'd like to tour out here in that I can come out and do a few shows in a few cities. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7406.26s)]
*  But also, I just really love like I love being in the States generally. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7411.26s)]
*  I love Nashville. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7415.26s)]
*  Big country music guys. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7416.26s)]
*  I love Nashville. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7417.26s)]
*  But I love New York. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7418.26s)]
*  I just love being here. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7419.26s)]
*  It's the best. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7420.26s)]
*  And like being here for like a week, jumping up and doing some spots, writing in the day, going to like I've got my places now where I go for pizza and for a sandwich and for a bit of coffee. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7421.26s)]
*  I know what I like and where it is. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7433.26s)]
*  I feel like I've got a good. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7434.26s)]
*  And there's so much more to this city I obviously haven't seen. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7435.26s)]
*  But like I can come to New York and not even get maps out on my phone and know where I'm going and know when I'm going to be places and stuff. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7438.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7447.26s)]
*  It's a grid system. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7448.26s)]
*  I really like it. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7449.26s)]
*  The British conversion is tough though. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7450.26s)]
*  I guess. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7453.26s)]
*  It's a whole thing. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7454.26s)]
*  What's one street in pounds? [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7455.26s)]
*  I think you should spend some more time here, man. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7457.26s)]
*  I think I think it'd be cool. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7458.26s)]
*  I also think it'd just be a fun experience to do like a random improv or funny bone. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7460.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7464.26s)]
*  You know, like just do a weekend of five shows, maybe while you're building an hour and just experience that here. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7465.26s)]
*  I would definitely like to do that at some point. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7469.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7471.26s)]
*  I like I think it's like in the same way that like American comedians think about doing the Edinburgh Festival. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7472.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7477.26s)]
*  This is like a very traditional British thing. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7478.26s)]
*  I like to take my show there. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7480.26s)]
*  But you know, I think it's a good thing. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7481.26s)]
*  I think about it like a fucking mall comedy club. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7483.26s)]
*  And you're doing five shows and you're at a shitty hotel. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7486.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnQ6nl4owg&t=7490.26s)]
