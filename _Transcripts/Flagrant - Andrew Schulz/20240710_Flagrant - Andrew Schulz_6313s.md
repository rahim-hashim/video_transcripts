*  Last question in the Patreon for no better reason. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2.7s)]
*  And y'all can watch it on Patreon for no better reason. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6.4s)]
*  Nobody asked for this. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=8.9s)]
*  Mark just brings up Sketch getting his back to the wall now for no better reason. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=10.0s)]
*  He's wearing pantyhose. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  Mark brings up a video. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=14.9s)]

*  Is he really or no? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  I can't figure it out. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=21.900000000000002s)]
*  Obviously these images have leaked. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  Let me squint my eyes so I don't get all the way in. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=24.3s)]
*  Apparently. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=26.0s)]
*  That's why I sketch like this. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=27.6s)]
*  He's like, God forbid I see some pussy on my turnstreet. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=29.200000000000003s)]
*  Do we know if it's him for real though? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=31.5s)]
*  I think he is gay. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=32.9s)]
*  I'm just now learning about this kid, but it seems like he is gay. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=34.300000000000004s)]
*  This is a real detective. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=37.3s)]
*  I'm just now learning. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=39.300000000000004s)]
*  You're like homo. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=41.0s)]
*  That shit is crazy though. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=45.1s)]

*  Yo, why'd you put your hand there? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=51.1s)]
*  I'm trying so hard not to look. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=52.1s)]
*  Just close your eyelids. You don't have to put your hand there. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=53.5s)]
*  Yeah, just don't look at it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=55.2s)]
*  Do we still, do we know if it's him for real though? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=56.400000000000006s)]
*  Like, is it possible that he confirmed it as a joke? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=58.9s)]
*  You don't want your kid to be dead, son. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=61.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=63.9s)]
*  Why can't he just be gay, Al? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=64.9s)]
*  Why can't he be gay, bro? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=66.2s)]
*  That's my point. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=67.4s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with him being gay. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=68.4s)]
*  I just want the truth. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=69.9s)]
*  But what's wrong with him being gay? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=70.9s)]
*  Nothing I can think of. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=72.4s)]
*  Why are you fighting so hard for him to be not gay? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=74.4s)]
*  I just want the truth. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=76.9s)]
*  The truth is pretty clear. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=77.9s)]

*  I mean, he's definitely going through something. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=100.9s)]
*  It's probably very difficult for him. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=101.9s)]

*  What do you mean why? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=181.9s)]
*  You don't approve of what he's doing? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=182.9s)]
*  He's probably meant like emotional requirings. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=183.9s)]
*  This is why I hope it's not real. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=184.9s)]

*  I'm going to be a fucking dick. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=209.9s)]
*  That was good. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=211.9s)]
*  I ain't going to lie. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=212.9s)]
*  That was good. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=213.9s)]
*  Let's take that back. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=214.9s)]
*  We don't even got a funny cam for me to look into. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=215.9s)]
*  Miles, cue it up. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=217.9s)]
*  Dude. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=218.9s)]
*  There you go. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=219.9s)]
*  He was late. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=220.9s)]
*  I guarantee you. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=221.9s)]
*  I know he was late. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=222.9s)]
*  I was looking into the camera. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=223.9s)]
*  I was on that shit. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=224.9s)]
*  Miles switches three seconds later. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=225.9s)]
*  I'm already looking back at Mark. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=226.9s)]
*  There's a security camera out there. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=227.9s)]
*  It's on the rain cam in the front. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=228.9s)]
*  I don't even know what Miles is doing back there. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=229.9s)]
*  Damn. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=231.9s)]
*  What the fuck is this? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=232.9s)]
*  Back to the episode. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=233.9s)]
*  We got to talk to Sketch, man. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=234.9s)]
*  Shout out, Sketch. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=235.9s)]
*  I hope you live your truth. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=236.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=238.9s)]
*  I hope you, if you're gay, I hope you're gay. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=239.9s)]
*  Yeah, brother. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=241.9s)]
*  Yeah, brother. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=242.9s)]
*  I gave him the, yeah, brother. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=243.9s)]
*  That's not encouraging. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=246.9s)]
*  Wait, what's that, like the? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=247.9s)]
*  Oh, not. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=248.9s)]
*  Let's get to, we're going to go back. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=249.9s)]
*  We're going to go back to the record of the rest of the episode. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=250.9s)]
*  Do you think he has a manager that is shrewd enough to be putting out these narratives [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=253.9s)]
*  on the internet to maintain relevance? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=259.9s)]
*  Wait, that he's gay? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=261.9s)]
*  No, faking this. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=264.9s)]
*  He's not faking AI images, saying that he used to be an OnlyFans creator. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=266.9s)]
*  Also, what dude had to be the one that admitted he f- [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=269.9s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=273.9s)]
*  Like, you don't want to be the dude in the frame group that's like, yo, yo, you're in [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=274.9s)]
*  Sketch, this isn't gay OnlyFans. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=277.9s)]
*  You can pretend somebody sent it, oh, I just got sent to me. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=278.9s)]
*  And then I, who? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=281.9s)]
*  Show us the DM. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=282.9s)]
*  Yeah, Mark, who sent this to you? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=283.9s)]
*  But it's Grand Wizard. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=285.9s)]
*  He's posting about it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=286.9s)]
*  Talk to him. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=287.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's true. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=288.9s)]
*  Why does he still have it activated? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=289.9s)]
*  Is it activated or somebody just like, get done? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=290.9s)]
*  Bro, I have no idea. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=293.9s)]
*  You tell us, Al, is it activated? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=294.9s)]
*  I mean, if they're up, if people are finding them right now, I would assume it's still [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=296.9s)]
*  activated. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=300.9s)]
*  Yeah, I got caught. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=301.9s)]
*  Oh, because I tried to do some research for the part. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=302.9s)]
*  You're gay! [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=306.9s)]
*  Did you look at the page? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=308.9s)]
*  Is it still up? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=310.9s)]
*  There's no way. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=311.9s)]
*  He's probably making so much f-ing money streaming, there's no reason even to do the gay porn. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=312.9s)]
*  You're doing it for the love of the game, bro. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=316.9s)]
*  You really are. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=317.9s)]
*  Love of the game clause, you know what I mean? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=318.9s)]
*  Damn. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=320.9s)]
*  Let him go at it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=321.9s)]
*  There's no way. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=322.9s)]
*  Why is there no way? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=323.9s)]
*  Let me tell you why. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=324.9s)]
*  I don't buy it. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=325.9s)]
*  Because last week, everybody was 100% convinced that the prison porno was real. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=326.9s)]
*  Did you see that one? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=333.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=335.9s)]
*  So this girl is getting f-ed, she's the CEO, she's getting f-ed by this guy in a prison [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=336.9s)]
*  in England. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=339.9s)]
*  And the other dude is filming on his phone, and everybody's like, oh my god, this girl [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=341.9s)]
*  has a boyfriend, her boyfriend's an MMA fighter, they have a kid together, their family's going [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=345.9s)]
*  to fall apart, blah, blah, blah. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=350.9s)]
*  And it just comes out today that the whole thing is fake. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=351.9s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=354.9s)]
*  So it's like, is this the new thing? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=355.9s)]
*  Might be the new thing, yo. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=358.9s)]
*  How much of it was fake? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=360.9s)]
*  So all of it is just a scene set up, those are just two random guys, no one's in jail, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=362.9s)]
*  nothing. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=365.9s)]
*  Aw, damn. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=366.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=367.9s)]
*  That's far. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=368.9s)]
*  It sucks, man. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=369.9s)]
*  And here's the f-ed up thing, why did we want it to be real? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=370.9s)]
*  It was kind of hot, dog. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=372.9s)]
*  She like, stop, then nothing got scared. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=374.9s)]
*  Why are these things hot? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=376.9s)]
*  She dropped her knees like a champion. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=378.9s)]
*  That's what I knew was fake. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=380.9s)]
*  It was the distance she put the penis inside of her head that was shocking, there was no [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=382.9s)]
*  warm-up or anything, trap door. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=388.9s)]
*  It was absolutely insane. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=391.9s)]
*  But why is there something hot about this? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=394.9s)]
*  Because it's naughty, dog, it's taboo. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=397.9s)]
*  Yeah, that's the single sex part. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=400.9s)]
*  Not everything taboo gives you an erection, though, hopefully, Mark. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=401.9s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=404.9s)]
*  Just because something's taboo, you're not like, this is hot, why is that hot? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=405.9s)]
*  She's a husband and a kid and she's sucking some f-ing Algerian guy's dick in a prison [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=408.9s)]
*  in Northern England and I'm like, turned on by this? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=413.9s)]
*  I should be turned on by this. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=416.9s)]
*  As you're saying it, I need to watch the video. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=418.9s)]
*  You get horny, right? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=420.9s)]
*  Why? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=421.9s)]
*  You just f-ing imagine Zidane headbutting her in the middle of a f-ing prison cell. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=422.9s)]
*  It's, why is that? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=426.9s)]
*  The ultimate desire to be wanted, that you're willing to risk everything. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=428.9s)]
*  You have your life, your family, your children, your money, everything, your career, and you're [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=431.9s)]
*  going to risk it all for this guy. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=435.9s)]
*  Okay, okay, so it is insecurity. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=436.9s)]
*  It's we all want to be desired so much by a girl that they would be willing to throw [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=439.9s)]
*  away everything. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=444.9s)]
*  I mean, think about her life. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=445.9s)]
*  She's a prison guard in Sheffield. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=446.9s)]
*  Think about what she's going to throw away. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=448.9s)]
*  40 pounds a year, 40,000 pounds a year. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=451.9s)]
*  Oh my God, how will she ever get another job? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=454.9s)]
*  But she's an immigrant, though, you got to consider that. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=457.9s)]
*  Oh, was she? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=460.9s)]
*  Yeah, she's Brazilian. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=461.9s)]
*  That's also hotter. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=462.9s)]
*  She doesn't even know that's not part of the job. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=463.9s)]
*  I think that's also an important thing. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=465.9s)]
*  Like, she doesn't know it's only fits. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=467.9s)]
*  The crazy part about that is technically that's a r-ing. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=469.9s)]
*  So we're all getting off by watching a r-ing. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=472.9s)]
*  She's r-ing now. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=474.9s)]
*  She is the power. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=475.9s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, creeps. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=476.9s)]
*  God damn, bro, yeah. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=478.9s)]
*  Female r-ing, don't be gay about it. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=479.9s)]
*  What a gay guy. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=481.9s)]
*  Nah, that's reality, bro. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=483.9s)]
*  Yo, that is the ultimate desire. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=484.9s)]
*  Wait a minute, hold on. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=490.9s)]
*  If Mark's theory is true, Mark might have threw out some Terence Howard shit, but we're [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=491.9s)]
*  going to go with this. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=496.9s)]
*  We're not fact checking. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=497.9s)]
*  Sit down, Brett Weinstein. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=498.9s)]
*  Okay, if Mark's theory is true that we are turned on by ultimate desire from women, like [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=499.9s)]
*  women becoming so in control of their actions due to their lust, right, that she would be [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=506.9s)]
*  willing to r- the man. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=519.9s)]
*  Technically, female to male, as long as it's not underage or anything like that, is the [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=522.9s)]
*  hottest form of sex. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=529.9s)]
*  I'm just saying, if we're going by this theory, if we're going by the theory, let's just go [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=531.9s)]
*  by the theory. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=535.9s)]
*  Mark, walk us through it. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=536.9s)]
*  And I don't mean to put you on this. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=537.9s)]
*  Okay, go. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=539.9s)]
*  I think you might be honest on this. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=540.9s)]
*  Is that it? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=542.9s)]
*  Do we just want to be wanted? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=543.9s)]
*  The fact that we want to be wanted so bad is why it's hard to do it. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=544.9s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=547.9s)]
*  Because we never- [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=548.9s)]
*  Because the second they want us that bad, we're into it. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=549.9s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=552.9s)]
*  And then they got to stop. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=553.9s)]
*  And then we don't- [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=554.9s)]
*  And there's only one thing we can do. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=555.9s)]
*  What? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=556.9s)]
*  Wait, not that. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=557.9s)]
*  Hold on, hold on. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=558.9s)]
*  Hold on, hold on. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=559.9s)]
*  That's why you never hear men like- [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=560.9s)]
*  We kind of beat that. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=561.9s)]
*  Now you're talking. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=562.9s)]
*  Now you're talking. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=563.9s)]
*  That's why you never- [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=564.9s)]
*  You never hear old men like that. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=565.9s)]
*  Old age men. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=566.9s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=567.9s)]
*  Instead of a bleep, just put, no. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=569.9s)]
*  But go, go, go. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=570.9s)]
*  That's why you never hear old age men like doing the accusation bad. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=571.9s)]
*  Because as soon as they're wanted so badly by a woman, even in a power differential, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=572.9s)]
*  they're just going to accept it. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=574.9s)]
*  Wow. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=575.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=576.9s)]
*  There is something incredibly flattering about a girl just wanting you so bad. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=577.9s)]
*  I mean, there's been moments in my life where there was a girl, she looked a lot like a [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=578.9s)]
*  rat at a Long Island show once. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=581.9s)]
*  And she was like, I just want to be the one. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=583.9s)]
*  And she was like, I just want to be the one. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=586.9s)]
*  And she was like, I just want to be the one. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=588.9s)]
*  And she was like, I just want to be the one. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=590.9s)]
*  And she was like, I just want to be the one. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=592.9s)]
*  And she was like, I just want to be the one. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=594.9s)]
*  And she was like, I just want to suck your dick in my car if you want to come right now. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=596.9s)]
*  And she was a rat looking girl. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=601.9s)]
*  I do want to come right now. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=602.9s)]
*  I'm so glad you brought that up. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=603.9s)]
*  But I was so turned on by it, I was like, maybe I should give you that. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=604.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=607.9s)]
*  You should have. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=608.9s)]
*  You can't be willing. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=609.9s)]
*  And then say no while she's doing it. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=610.9s)]
*  Just to like throw her off? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=613.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=614.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=615.9s)]

*  You know it's good because I invested in Dumbo and I hate doing that. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=687.9s)]
*  So go there. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=690.9s)]

*  Fontanious. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=703.9s)]
*  Let's get back to the show. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=704.9s)]
*  The gayest things we do in straight sets. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=705.9s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=707.9s)]
*  When a guy sees a handsome guy and goes, man, you must get so much pussy. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=708.9s)]
*  People be saying, male comics will say that to Mark as if that's not gay. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=712.9s)]
*  Instead of just being like, you're a good looking guy. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=717.9s)]
*  They'll be like, dude, I bet you get so much pussy. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=719.9s)]
*  Why is that gay? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=721.9s)]
*  What's gay about that? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=722.9s)]
*  I bet you get your dick sucked all the time, bro. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=724.9s)]
*  Girls are just on their knees. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=726.9s)]
*  I bet you girls see what's good. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=728.9s)]
*  It's so much gay. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=730.9s)]
*  Continuing it past just getting pussy, describing what happens. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=733.9s)]
*  You just be like, hey, he's a handsome guy. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=737.9s)]
*  No, no, this is the one that was funny. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=739.9s)]
*  One of our boys said this to Mark once. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=741.9s)]
*  He was like, man, you're so stupid being married, bro. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=742.9s)]
*  Do you know how many girls you could fuck if you weren't married? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=746.9s)]
*  Mark is like, what do you mean? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=750.9s)]
*  He goes, man, you would just be fucking everything. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=752.9s)]
*  After shows, girls coming up to you. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=758.9s)]
*  You just fucking him in a green room. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=760.9s)]
*  Why are you thinking about me fucking? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=762.9s)]
*  That's gay. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=765.9s)]
*  That's extremely gay of him. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=766.9s)]
*  Oh my god, dude. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=767.9s)]
*  How attractive can you, this is more like an academics question, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=768.9s)]
*  but how attractive to a guy can you be before it's gay? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=772.9s)]
*  Because Tom Brady was an attractive dude. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=778.9s)]
*  I'm sure. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=782.9s)]
*  I didn't feel gay, but I felt more gay than when I look at y'all. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=783.9s)]
*  Yeah, I don't like it. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=787.9s)]
*  I'm not saying y'all are not attractive, but you don't get my dick nothing. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=789.9s)]
*  Nah, one look at me will straighten you right up. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=793.9s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=795.9s)]
*  We'll get one of them veins going. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=796.9s)]
*  Maybe, maybe. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=798.9s)]
*  But when does it become that? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=801.9s)]
*  At 51%. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=803.9s)]
*  And that's your thing, Doug. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=804.9s)]
*  Doug believes he's 51% straight. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=807.9s)]
*  He is literally 2% away from actually being a homosexual man. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=810.9s)]
*  We can all be that. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=814.9s)]
*  We can all be that. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=815.9s)]
*  Until you're like, I don't want that. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=816.9s)]
*  Why do you want it all 49 on your couch right now? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=819.9s)]
*  He's like, by popular vote, I'm gay. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=822.9s)]
*  But if it goes back to $1, I'm straight in actually 30 states. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=824.9s)]
*  He's drunk in 2016. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=828.9s)]
*  I'm just giving you guys the runway. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=832.9s)]
*  You can comment on a guy as much as you want, but then... [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=834.9s)]
*  I think if you think about them having sex, remember when Vala was like, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=836.9s)]
*  yo, Shannon Sharpe. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=839.9s)]
*  That was 51%. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=841.9s)]
*  We looked at a picture of Shannon Sharpe's shirtless ass going crazy. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=843.9s)]
*  We were just talking about Shannon Sharpe. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=846.9s)]
*  His show was hilarious. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=848.9s)]
*  This guy's killing it. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=849.9s)]
*  And we saw a picture of him without a shirt at 50 something years old. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=850.9s)]
*  He looks amazing. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=853.9s)]
*  He looks handsome. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=854.9s)]
*  And we're like, man, this guy's in great shape. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=855.9s)]
*  I wish I looked like that. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=857.9s)]
*  Vala goes, man, he must be crazy in bed. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=858.9s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=862.9s)]

*  What? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=867.9s)]
*  What? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=868.9s)]
*  That's different. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=869.9s)]
*  He must be crazy. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=871.9s)]
*  And that's where it's gay. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=872.9s)]
*  He must be crazy. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=873.9s)]
*  That's it. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=874.9s)]

*  What the fuck is that about? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=876.9s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=878.9s)]
*  Like, what positions are you even thinking about? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=879.9s)]
*  Like, telling your mans to get ahead from the girl you're both smashing? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=881.9s)]
*  Like, is that one of the positions? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=885.9s)]
*  Because if you're thinking of him being crazy, but you're thinking of him on top, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=887.9s)]
*  which is a gayer way to think about him, you know what I'm saying? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=890.9s)]
*  Like, you're thinking about his dude-ass... [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=893.9s)]
*  No, I don't think he's just thinking about positions. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=894.9s)]
*  No, you are. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=896.9s)]
*  You're thinking about his dude-ass flexing. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=897.9s)]
*  That dude-ass flex is not a good look. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=898.9s)]
*  That is gay, bro. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=900.9s)]
*  It's not a good look. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=901.9s)]
*  We look like dragons. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=902.9s)]
*  You ever kid yourself with beers? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=904.9s)]

*  If he's talking about Shannon Sharp, though, he looks like he does some squats. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=913.9s)]
*  What are you trying to say? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=916.9s)]

*  What's the preemptive LOL about? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1077.62s)]
*  It's condescending. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1079.62s)]
*  She's a shade room commenter. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1080.62s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1082.62s)]
*  They be going in. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1083.62s)]
*  They be going in. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1084.62s)]
*  That's just how they show love. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1085.62s)]
*  I'm just amazed she's defending the Swift like that. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1087.62s)]
*  She's defending the Swifties. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1089.94s)]
*  Yeah, I got more tea on the Taylor shit. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1090.94s)]
*  Oh, let's go. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1092.5s)]
*  If y'all want to know, I know we're having fun having gay talk though, so I don't want [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1093.5s)]
*  to move off of that shit. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1096.46s)]
*  We can move on. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1097.46s)]
*  And there's nothing straighter than four guys talking about Taylor Swift. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1098.46s)]
*  It's a perfect segue. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1101.46s)]
*  You sure? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1102.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1103.46s)]
*  I don't know if this is the same tea I already said though. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1104.46s)]
*  If I'm being completely honest with you, it might be redundant tea. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1108.46s)]
*  It might be a little warm. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1113.46s)]
*  It might be redundant tea. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1114.46s)]
*  It might be a little warm tea. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1115.46s)]
*  It might be redundant tea. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1116.46s)]
*  Run back to Chops. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1117.46s)]
*  Okay, here's the tea. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1120.46s)]
*  I think that not even that. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1121.46s)]
*  This is this is I'm going to give you the information. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1127.6200000000001s)]
*  Okay, but this is my presumption. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1129.82s)]
*  I'm putting this out. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1131.82s)]
*  I think Taylor's team lied to her to protect their jobs after fumbling the biggest deal [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1133.98s)]
*  in music history. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1141.94s)]
*  And I think she believed the lie because you'd rather believe your dad ain't fucked you. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1143.78s)]
*  Your dad didn't fuck you over. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1149.54s)]
*  Your managers didn't fuck you over. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1150.78s)]
*  Your new record exec didn't fuck you. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1152.5s)]
*  You'd rather believe everybody around you that's there to protect you didn't fuck you [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1154.54s)]
*  over and that these two other dudes did. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1157.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1160.66s)]
*  But what's this based on? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1161.66s)]
*  Okay, so she sends this. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1164.8600000000001s)]
*  I actually got this fucking letter. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1167.82s)]
*  So she sends this. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1169.38s)]
*  She agrees to go to Universal, right? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1171.66s)]
*  With this guy, Lucien Grange guy. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1173.3s)]
*  She agrees to go there. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1174.8600000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1176.54s)]
*  Lucien tells her as part of the deal, we're going to give you back your masters, which [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1177.62s)]
*  has never happened before in history. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1181.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1183.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1184.3s)]
*  But she but he goes, you can't say anything to Scott Borchetta with the guy who owns big [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1185.3s)]
*  machine because if you say that it's going to happen, then he's going to charge me out [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1189.06s)]
*  the fucking ass and then it doesn't even make sense. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1193.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1195.6599999999999s)]
*  So I need you to tell him you don't even want them because if you say you don't want the [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1196.6599999999999s)]
*  masters, then I can get them for a good amount. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1201.86s)]
*  There's not going to be this, ideally not this crazy bidding war. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1205.3s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1207.74s)]
*  Now, I don't know if Lucien is telling her that, but the deal is, is it under the table [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1208.74s)]
*  hush deal that she's going to get the masters. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1212.94s)]
*  As part of this thing, this has never happened before in music. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1216.86s)]
*  She sends a text that's public domain. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1219.34s)]
*  You can go look at it right now. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1221.34s)]
*  Matter of fact, I might have it. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1222.6599999999999s)]
*  That big machine put it up on their fucking website. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1224.34s)]
*  So she sends this text, right? [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1226.78s)]
*  And the text is to Scott Borchetta, right? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1229.46s)]
*  The text reads as this. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1233.26s)]
*  You ready? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1235.82s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1236.82s)]
*  Scott, I hope this finds you well. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1237.82s)]
*  Since communication ran dry on our negotiations, I've done what I told you I would do and gone [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1240.3s)]
*  out exploring other options. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1245.78s)]
*  Owning my masters was very important to me, but I've since realized that there are things [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1248.02s)]
*  that mean even more to me in the bigger picture. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1252.7s)]
*  I had a choice whether to bet on my past or to bet on the future. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1255.66s)]
*  And I think knowing me, you can guess which one I chose. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1260.36s)]
*  I also saw a rare opportunity to affect positive change for a lot of other artists with the [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1263.6s)]
*  leverage I have right now. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1267.48s)]
*  I know you believe in the same things that I do. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1269.4399999999998s)]
*  I'd like to think that you would be proud of what I've negotiated for in my deal. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1272.08s)]
*  That's the new one with Universal. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1275.84s)]
*  I wanted to tell you first that I'll be signing with Lucian Universal. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1277.28s)]
*  I honestly truly cherish everything you and I have built together. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1281.28s)]
*  And I plan on saying so in my announcement of the new deal. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1284.3999999999999s)]
*  What we accomplish together will be a lasting legacy and a case study on excellent partnerships [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1288.78s)]
*  and may it continue. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1293.46s)]
*  I still view you as a partner and friend and I hope you feel the same. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1294.54s)]
*  Sending you a hug and my most sincere gratitude and so much love, Taylor. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1298.18s)]
*  Political, brilliant, authentic, beautiful. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1303.18s)]
*  Beautiful message. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1306.54s)]
*  I'm good on the masters. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1308.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1310.06s)]
*  She says she's going to go to the set of place. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1314.1399999999999s)]
*  Okay? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1316.74s)]
*  Scooter comes in and goes, hold on, she's not buying the masters? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1319.1s)]
*  Hey, I'd like to buy the masters. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1323.46s)]
*  Tell Scott Prochetta, hey, if she wants to be involved in this, pull her in. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1326.7s)]
*  Scott Prochetta sends him that text message. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1330.98s)]
*  She doesn't want to be part of it. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1334.8999999999999s)]
*  Universal is trying to buy the masters for $270 million. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1338.74s)]
*  Assuming in that situation that if you're Lucian and you're invested in her future, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1343.02s)]
*  you also want to be invested in her past. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1346.8999999999999s)]
*  Makes perfect sense. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1348.8999999999999s)]
*  Scooter's like $270, shit, I'll do it for more. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1350.9399999999998s)]
*  He doesn't know that the plan is to give the master. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1353.4199999999998s)]
*  This never happened before in fucking history. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1356.5s)]
*  Give masters. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1358.2199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1359.2199999999998s)]
*  He goes, I'll buy them for more than that. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1360.2199999999998s)]
*  What does Scott Prochetta want to do more than anything? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1362.3799999999999s)]
*  The most money. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1364.78s)]
*  Fuck that guy. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1365.78s)]
*  I'm not going to give you, make the most money one, but I'm also not going to give the masters [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1366.78s)]
*  to the guy who stole the most valuable client I will ever have in the history of my business. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1370.3s)]
*  I'm not going to give the master to the client I'm going to give him. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1375.6999999999998s)]
*  Fuck that. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1377.6599999999999s)]
*  I got another one for more money and I get to stuff it to that motherfucker. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1378.6599999999999s)]
*  Boom. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1382.34s)]
*  I don't get why Universal thought that would work. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1383.34s)]
*  I don't know what their calculation was. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1385.1s)]
*  It was like, oh, we'll buy it from the guy that's mad at us. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1387.62s)]
*  This is why I have a little empathy for what Taylor thought. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1389.78s)]
*  Her team fucked up the greatest record deal in history. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1393.9799999999998s)]
*  The greatest record deal in history. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1397.82s)]
*  You have to lock that in before she goes. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1400.54s)]
*  You have to lock in the deal for $270. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1402.3s)]
*  They didn't lock in that deal. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1404.54s)]
*  I think Taylor thought that it was locked in. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1405.54s)]
*  I think her team, all to save their own asses, said it was and then Scooter and Scott, they [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1407.82s)]
*  fucking backchanneled and they stole it from us. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1413.98s)]
*  Because if they say what really happened, which is what the email correspondences show, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1418.1s)]
*  that their team didn't have a fucking deal, they fucked up and these guys made one to [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1422.58s)]
*  stuff it, stick it to or to stick it to Universal. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1426.42s)]
*  So the team is in fucking desperation mode. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1431.5s)]
*  We're all going to get fired. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1434.1799999999998s)]
*  We fucked up the biggest deal in music history. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1435.82s)]
*  The biggest artist in history. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1438.74s)]
*  Her first six albums. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1439.98s)]
*  We fucked it up. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1441.5s)]
*  We got to have a scapegoat. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1443.02s)]
*  What's a scapegoat? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1444.9399999999998s)]
*  Scott Pratchetta, Scooter Braun. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1445.9399999999998s)]
*  What sticks? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1448.24s)]
*  Scooter Braun. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1449.24s)]
*  And then what happens is once the narrative already exists, it's like House of Dragons, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1452.4199999999998s)]
*  it's like, okay, I don't want to go back against this. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1455.6999999999998s)]
*  I imagine it's come to light. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1459.6999999999998s)]
*  I imagine Taylor now probably knows what really happened. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1461.1799999999998s)]
*  I mean, fairly quickly, Big Machine put out those text messages, here's the correspondences, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1464.02s)]
*  here's everything. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1468.7s)]
*  Once the narrative is set, you just run with those narratives. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1469.7s)]
*  And it's a great narrative that continues the victimhood narrative, right? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1472.46s)]
*  So it's like everything's kind of perfect and you just want to look the other way and [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1476.32s)]
*  you want to drive as fast as you possibly can. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1479.34s)]
*  The only problem is, you know, some fucked up shit ends up having a Scoopers family, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1481.46s)]
*  the death threats, her telling her fans, go tell them how you feel, and then these fucking [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1486.82s)]
*  lunatics go start a fight. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1490.42s)]
*  I still don't love is at the end of the documentary, Taylor's team, they ask her for comments. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1491.42s)]
*  She's like, we'd like to move on from this. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1496.54s)]
*  I bet you would. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1497.9s)]
*  This is in our past. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1498.9s)]
*  I see mad comments on the post that we put up. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1499.9s)]
*  Taylor wants to move on from this. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1502.02s)]
*  She wants nothing to do with this. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1503.02s)]
*  This is in her past. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1504.02s)]
*  When has she ever let anything go? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1505.0600000000002s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1508.46s)]
*  She talked about Kanye for fucking years when she was the victim. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1509.46s)]
*  When somebody else is a victim and she wants, guys, why are we putting Harbin on the back? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1514.78s)]
*  This is old news. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1519.3400000000001s)]
*  And that is the thing that I'm like, you know, I can give her the benefit of the doubt to [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1521.5s)]
*  a large degree. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1525.3799999999999s)]
*  That is funny though, that all of a sudden when you win a billion dollars now, we don't [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1526.84s)]
*  need to focus on the past. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1532.26s)]
*  This guy's life got threatened. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1533.82s)]
*  I got nothing to do with that, even though you actively called for it. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1534.82s)]
*  If you know, you can't tell me Trump called for called for insurrection or whatever, and [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1538.1s)]
*  Taylor didn't call for this guy's family to get threatened. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1543.1s)]
*  That's a great argument. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1545.1s)]
*  You can't believe, you either believe none or believe both. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1546.1s)]
*  It's the same shit. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1549.18s)]
*  Stand down and stand by is actually softer than tell them how you feel. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1551.18s)]
*  Yeah, that's rush to capital. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1555.3799999999999s)]
*  She said rush to capital. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1557.3799999999999s)]
*  She's still a storm, that bitch. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1558.3799999999999s)]
*  But it's interesting that she talks so much about the patriarchy and the power of the [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1560.06s)]
*  patriarchy and she's behaving a lot like it. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1563.54s)]
*  That is a dude. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1566.1s)]
*  That is a thing that drives me crazy. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1567.1s)]
*  And I say this about minorities all the time when we just want to... [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1568.34s)]
*  Still best concert I've ever seen. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1570.82s)]
*  I just want to point that out. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1571.82s)]
*  That would never take anything away from me. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1572.82s)]
*  She's a historically great artist. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1574.3s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1576.78s)]
*  Anybody's trying to say otherwise, you're lying to yourself. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1577.78s)]
*  But... [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1580.98s)]
*  And her team knows that and they know they fucked up. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1581.98s)]
*  And I presume they fucking lied to her and then she ran with it and she's too embarrassed [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1583.8999999999999s)]
*  to acknowledge she ran with it. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1588.22s)]
*  And she might even believe it. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1589.8999999999999s)]
*  But there's proof of what really happened. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1591.82s)]
*  There's email correspondence. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1594.02s)]
*  It's all out there. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1595.22s)]
*  Like all the truth is out there. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1596.22s)]
*  But people would rather believe the lie that's more interesting, which is the girl got taken [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1598.06s)]
*  advantage of by these evil record execs. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1601.66s)]
*  No. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1604.22s)]
*  Your fucking team fucked up. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1605.22s)]
*  Your daddy, who's on the board, fucked up. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1606.42s)]
*  The lawyer your daddy appointed to look at every email just so he can't... [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1608.5800000000002s)]
*  He fucked up. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1612.66s)]
*  Everything is there. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1613.66s)]
*  His dad is responding to emails. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1614.66s)]
*  What is it? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1616.26s)]
*  Scott Swift? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1617.26s)]
*  Her dad. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1618.26s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1619.26s)]
*  Her dad is responding to emails. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1620.26s)]
*  There's screenshots of this shit. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1621.26s)]
*  It's all out there. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1622.26s)]
*  It's the most obvious fucking thing in music history that nobody talks about or cares about [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1623.26s)]
*  because she's so famous. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1626.5800000000002s)]
*  And just being famous and successful doesn't mean that you should allow to accept these [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1627.92s)]
*  fucking narratives. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1631.18s)]
*  Now, Phil Babersgud or not, that guy's a fucking billionaire. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1632.18s)]
*  He did great. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1635.54s)]
*  He's doing awesome. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1636.54s)]
*  Okay? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1637.54s)]
*  But he also does have to deal with a large swath of the world thinking that he did something [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1638.54s)]
*  which he did not do that might go against his character. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1642.5s)]
*  And that's fucked up. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1646.06s)]
*  Imagine if people just thought you did some shit that you did not do. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1647.06s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1649.62s)]
*  It would annoy you. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1650.62s)]
*  It would rub you the wrong way a little bit. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1651.62s)]
*  And if your family's getting threatened, you want to dislike the guy cool, but if your [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1653.06s)]
*  family's getting threatened, it's just a different ballgame. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1656.3s)]
*  It just is. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1658.5s)]
*  The second you bring family into it, you cross a fucking line. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1659.5s)]
*  Everybody knows this. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1662.94s)]
*  You bring wife. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1663.94s)]
*  They're talking about children. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1665.38s)]
*  You're a fucking, that's some demonic shit. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1666.38s)]
*  You bring kids into something. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1668.22s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1669.22s)]
*  I'm curious. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1670.22s)]
*  Do you know if Universal changed a deal since they weren't able to get, buy the Masters? [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1671.22s)]
*  Because I'm sure that was the carrot that got Taylor to sign. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1676.54s)]
*  That is an absolutely phenomenal question now. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1679.7s)]
*  Sorry, what'd you say? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1683.9s)]
*  This is a great fucking question. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1685.18s)]
*  Because I'm sure the big pull to get Taylor to sign at Universal was, hey, we're going [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1687.1000000000001s)]
*  to buy your Masters and give it to you. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1691.1000000000001s)]
*  Now that they couldn't attain her Master, did they give her a different deal? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1692.7s)]
*  That would be, we got to find that out. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1696.8600000000001s)]
*  Coming to you next week. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1701.06s)]
*  That because if they do change the deal and add more upside or incentivize in some new [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1703.02s)]
*  way, they acknowledge that they had this preexisting thing. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1708.6200000000001s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1713.74s)]
*  Because why would Taylor accept the same deal and lose out on $300 million worth of music [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1715.64s)]
*  rights? [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1721.3s)]
*  It's in perpetuity. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1722.3s)]
*  It's 300 million then. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1723.3s)]
*  Now who knows what the fuck it's worth? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1724.3s)]
*  Bruh. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1726.98s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1727.98s)]
*  And was there a contract she signed with Universal before the Masters got put through? [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1728.98s)]
*  Or is that just like in talks? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1735.26s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1736.98s)]
*  That's the thing I want to know. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1737.98s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1738.98s)]
*  Because she was being offered by Big Machine a way to get her Masters back through making [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1739.98s)]
*  more albums or just buy it back herself. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1745.02s)]
*  She had like, I don't know, a few hundred million at the time and it would liquidate [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1747.5s)]
*  her essentially to buy back the Masters. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1750.02s)]
*  So I'm sure, reasonably so, you're hesitating. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1751.5s)]
*  Though you could get a loan to get your shit back. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1754.34s)]
*  You're one of the biggest artists in the world. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1756.7s)]
*  Doesn't matter. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1758.18s)]
*  It's way better when some other company's like, we're going to get it back for you. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1759.18s)]
*  Now do we want to get really nasty with it? [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1761.54s)]
*  If we want to get really nasty with it, what if they promised it to her, knowing full well, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1764.62s)]
*  they didn't really care that much to get her the Masters. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1771.7s)]
*  They were going to lowball, see if they could get them. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1775.5s)]
*  If they couldn't get them, who gives a fuck? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1777.62s)]
*  We got this Taylor girl and you know what she's going to do? [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1779.66s)]
*  Mark, what do you think she's going to do? [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1782.18s)]
*  I think she's going to make some more albums. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1784.8200000000002s)]
*  I think she's going to make a lot of money. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1785.8200000000002s)]
*  And not only will she make some more albums, maybe she'll re-record those original ones [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1787.5s)]
*  that we don't have the rights to. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1795.42s)]
*  You think they knew that though? [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1797.02s)]
*  I'm just saying, what is cheaper? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1799.26s)]
*  If you re-record them, galvanize your fans based on this bullshit narrative that they [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1801.5400000000002s)]
*  should go out there and now she can get the money from them, you get the money from them, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1806.54s)]
*  you didn't have to lose the 300 million in the first place. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1813.34s)]
*  It's almost, now we're getting real conspiratorial and I have no proof for any of this, but it's [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1816.82s)]
*  a way better deal if you ask me for Universal. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1820.6599999999999s)]
*  You save 270 million dollars and you still get all the fucking albums. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1824.74s)]
*  So she did get screwed over by music executives, but it was the other ones. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1829.58s)]
*  But it was the other ones. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1833.1s)]
*  I imagine she's either too embarrassed or doesn't truly know what really happened to [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1834.4599999999998s)]
*  admit it. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1838.78s)]
*  Because you don't want to go, I went to Universal and all these men fucked me and I'm staying [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1839.78s)]
*  here. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1843.98s)]
*  And you've got to stay because you signed that fucking contract. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1845.1799999999998s)]
*  Can you check if the new re-recorded albums are under Universal? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1848.62s)]
*  I'm sure she owns the complete masters for them, but I imagine that, I don't know how [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1852.3799999999999s)]
*  record deals work where sometimes distribution, I think Universal still has the distribution [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1857.3799999999999s)]
*  on them. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1862.58s)]
*  But if she owns all the rights masters for it, that's kind of the smoking gun right there. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1863.6599999999999s)]
*  Because? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1870.5s)]
*  She signed to a label, she's putting out a new album, that should automatically go to [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1871.5s)]
*  the label. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1877.06s)]
*  The label should automatically own the rights. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1878.06s)]
*  Well I'm sure the deal that she had was she gets to keep her masters in perpetuity, all [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1880.78s)]
*  of them. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1884.78s)]
*  Oh you think even the new albums she's putting out? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1885.78s)]
*  I would imagine, I would imagine she might be that bad. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1886.78s)]
*  I think Universal, what his theory is, and I don't know, I think we're giving her a lot [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1888.82s)]
*  of benefit of the doubt, but I'm fine doing that because her fans scare me. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1893.62s)]
*  I think what he's saying is, Universal's like, hey you know what, why don't you just re-record [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1896.94s)]
*  your albums and you'll keep those masters, we know we fucked up. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1901.7s)]
*  You re-record the albums, you keep the masters, they're all yours, you didn't have to pay [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1905.58s)]
*  for them, they're yours. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1908.74s)]
*  But they still get the distribution. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1910.54s)]
*  So they still won. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1911.96s)]
*  They didn't have to pay for the masters and they got the distribution. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1912.96s)]
*  And you know what Akash? [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1914.96s)]
*  You know what they were going to get for the six albums earlier? [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1916.06s)]
*  Just the distribution. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1919.3799999999999s)]
*  So now you get the distribution and you save $300 million. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1921.5s)]
*  If that is what happened, the real asshole here is this guy Lucian and Scooter's getting [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1926.5s)]
*  all the fucking heat. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1932.1s)]
*  And we could throw you an extra $100 million, Taylor, just we fucked up, I'm sorry. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1934.34s)]
*  And we're still, now we made things right with you and we're still saving $100 million. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1939.02s)]
*  I wouldn't say Lucian's an asshole, he's just a smart businessman. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1943.6599999999999s)]
*  Are we afraid of him as well or is it just Swifties? [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1947.06s)]
*  What I'm saying is, no, no, what I'm saying is this. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1951.4599999999998s)]
*  He's a smart businessman. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1953.9799999999998s)]
*  No, no, what I'm saying is this is, fuck that guy. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1954.9799999999998s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1958.5s)]
*  Hey, hey, hey, ready? [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1960.62s)]
*  Fuck that guy. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1961.86s)]
*  Fucking over the Swifties like that. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1962.86s)]
*  How dare he fuck over Taylor and Swifties? [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1964.34s)]
*  They didn't know any better. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1968.6999999999998s)]
*  What a jerk. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1969.6999999999998s)]
*  They've been duped. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1970.6999999999998s)]
*  What a jerk to fuck over the Swifties. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1971.6999999999998s)]
*  My friendship braids it. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1974.1s)]
*  Fuck it. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1975.1s)]
*  There it is. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1976.1s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1977.1s)]
*  Swiftie gang. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1978.1s)]
*  It says her new contract with Republic Records gives her complete ownership of her songs [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1979.1s)]
*  and therefore Taylor's version was born. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1982.02s)]
*  I don't know if Republic and Universal are the same. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1984.74s)]
*  Maybe Republic is within Universal or something. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1987.26s)]
*  And it's complete ownership include distribution? [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1988.66s)]
*  I think you still need a distributor. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1991.38s)]
*  So they'll get this distribution rights which is the only thing they're going to fucking [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1993.98s)]
*  get anyway and they save $270 million. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1996.54s)]
*  And nobody's talking about it. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=1999.58s)]
*  The narrative that she has is so fucking sexy. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2002.1799999999998s)]
*  If you're a young girl, you got your heart broken a million fucking times, you have guys [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2004.5s)]
*  manipulate you, treat you like shit. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2008.7s)]
*  Why the fuck would you want to believe that things were happening in good faith? [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2010.58s)]
*  Also music executives historically don't have the best track record. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2014.34s)]
*  So it's an easy person to jump on. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2017.34s)]
*  Of course. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2019.1399999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2020.1399999999999s)]
*  Okay? [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2021.1399999999999s)]
*  I want... [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2022.1399999999999s)]
*  Fucking scooter. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2023.1399999999999s)]
*  Fucking scooter. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2024.1399999999999s)]
*  Okay? [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2025.1399999999999s)]
*  Fucking scooter. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2027.14s)]
*  Okay? [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2028.14s)]
*  I wonder if it affected his business in any way where artists were like, oh, if I work [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2029.14s)]
*  here, is it going to... [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2033.74s)]
*  Am I going to lose my masters or whatever? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2035.3400000000001s)]
*  I wonder if it did affect his bottom line in some way. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2037.0200000000002s)]
*  Lucian? [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2039.7800000000002s)]
*  No, Scooter in the long term. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2040.7800000000002s)]
*  I wonder if artists were hesitant and had to be explained the whole story. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2041.7800000000002s)]
*  I would assume, yes. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2045.3000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2046.3000000000002s)]
*  If I was a new artist signing with him, would I be like, oh, could this backfire? [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2047.3000000000002s)]
*  Because her narrative is so compelling. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2050.58s)]
*  I wonder if there's any verifiable way he could prove that it affected his business. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2052.82s)]
*  And then he had to go all the way to Korea. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2056.1s)]
*  He had to go all the way to Korea where they can't even pronounce Taylor Swift. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2058.06s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2062.06s)]
*  That's what he had to do. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2063.06s)]
*  They forced him to go to fucking Korea to make boy bands. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2064.3399999999997s)]
*  What are they? [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2067.5s)]
*  Boys. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2068.5s)]
*  They're boys, boy bands. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2069.5s)]
*  This is disgusting, what they've done to this poor man. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2070.5s)]
*  Would you want to be an artist that's associated with Scooter who has beef with the biggest [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2072.7799999999997s)]
*  artists in the world? [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2078.22s)]
*  That definitely fucked up his bottom line because other people wouldn't. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2080.3399999999997s)]
*  I think he got to sue Taylor Swift. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2082.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean... [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2085.02s)]
*  You ain't going to win that one. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2086.02s)]
*  Sorry, Swifties. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2087.82s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2088.82s)]

*  We are so removed. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2107.26s)]
*  Listen, Swifties, free your girl from the real music execs that are fucking her over. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2110.3s)]
*  Her dad? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2116.1800000000003s)]
*  Lucien? [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2117.1800000000003s)]
*  What does Lucien look like? [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2118.1800000000003s)]
*  She's over this. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2120.94s)]
*  I think she wants to move on. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2121.94s)]
*  She wants to move on, bro. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2122.94s)]
*  She wants to move on and make billions of dollars. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2123.94s)]
*  Yeah, let's move on. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2126.94s)]
*  Why have we been bringing up this tea? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2127.94s)]
*  I went to the concert. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2128.94s)]
*  Let's talk about something relevant like when Kanye stole her popcorn award. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2129.94s)]
*  That shit mattered. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2132.94s)]
*  That was fucked up. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2133.94s)]
*  That shit mattered. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2134.94s)]
*  That space trophy or whatever. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2135.94s)]
*  That was a horrible thing. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2136.94s)]
*  That was horrible. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2137.94s)]
*  That was traumatizing, dude. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2139.62s)]
*  I know, that's horrible. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2141.62s)]
*  Remember when I went to that concert? [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2142.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2143.62s)]
*  You want to know who got me tickets to that shit? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2144.62s)]
*  Scooter Braun. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2146.62s)]
*  So I just heard something insane. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2151.62s)]
*  You know Netflix has over 18,000 titles globally, but only 6,000 are available to us in the [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2152.62s)]
*  US. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2158.9s)]
*  So we are literally missing out on thousands of great shows, 12,000 or more to be exact, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2159.9s)]
*  unless you use ExpressVPN. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2164.82s)]
*  Tons of people spend over $100 a month on streaming services, Netflix, Disney+, Prime, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2166.7000000000003s)]
*  blah, blah, blah. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2170.5s)]
*  But if you use ExpressVPN, you can cut back to just Netflix, maybe one or two others if [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2171.5s)]
*  you want, save so much every month. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2175.6600000000003s)]
*  I'll explain how. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2177.5s)]
*  Like I said, Netflix hides content from you based on which country you're in. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2178.6600000000003s)]
*  So in the US, you only have access to about a third of their actual library. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2182.06s)]
*  But with ExpressVPN, you can change your online location to a country where say the access [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2185.46s)]
*  isn't restricted, and you can get way more TV shows, movies, etc. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2189.98s)]
*  They got servers in over 100 countries, so you can gain access to thousands of new shows [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2194.2999999999997s)]
*  and never run out of stuff to watch. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2198.18s)]
*  I've used it in the US to watch Friends on Netflix, to watch Modern Family on Netflix, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2199.58s)]
*  and I've used it when I travel abroad. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2205.14s)]
*  I was doing shows in Europe during football season. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2206.7799999999997s)]
*  You know how I accessed good old American football? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2208.9s)]
*  I accessed the American VPN and there you go. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2211.94s)]
*  Guys sign up for ExpressVPN. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2215.38s)]
*  It's easy to use. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2217.02s)]
*  You just fire up the app, click on one button to change locations. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2218.02s)]
*  It works on phones, laptops, smart TVs and more. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2220.18s)]
*  And it was rated number one by top tech reviewers like CNET and The Verge. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2222.62s)]
*  So be smart. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2226.42s)]
*  Stop paying full price for streaming services and only getting access to a fraction of the [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2227.42s)]
*  content. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2230.9s)]
*  Get your money's worth at ExpressVPN.com slash flagrant. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2231.9s)]
*  Don't forget to use that link. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2235.2999999999997s)]
*  It is ExpressVPN.com slash flagrant because you will get an extra three months of ExpressVPN [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2236.8199999999997s)]
*  for free. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2243.46s)]
*  Now let's get back to the show. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2244.46s)]
*  Alex does pretend to be a rapper. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2245.46s)]
*  Have you ever heard this? [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2246.8199999999997s)]
*  This is a true story. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2247.8199999999997s)]
*  Alex does pretend to be a rapper. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2250.14s)]
*  He likes to get rap clout. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2252.1s)]
*  Please tell me. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2253.1s)]
*  Alex told me in confidence. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2254.1s)]
*  He said don't tell him this. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2255.1s)]
*  I said I never will. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2256.1s)]
*  But I'll tell you guys privately. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2257.1s)]
*  Basically sometimes when he flies Delta One, he intentionally puts on some chains and some [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2260.1s)]
*  rings and some stuff. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2264.1s)]
*  He said this on Patreon. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2265.1s)]
*  To be a rapper. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2266.1s)]
*  That way people see him and they go, oh, this guy must be a rapper. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2267.1s)]
*  So he's trying to double dip on the rap clout and the podcast clout. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2270.1s)]
*  I hope you get pulled over. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2273.3399999999997s)]
*  I hope you get pulled over. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2274.3399999999997s)]
*  That's a death threat. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2275.3399999999997s)]
*  That's a death threat. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2276.3399999999997s)]
*  That is a death threat. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2277.3399999999997s)]
*  I knew it. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2278.3399999999997s)]
*  I knew it. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2279.3399999999997s)]
*  Not in every city. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2280.98s)]
*  I hope you get inconvenienced by this. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2281.98s)]
*  When I drive, all this is off. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2283.98s)]
*  You got a sweater trying to hang up like Carlson? [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2289.98s)]
*  Stop it. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2291.98s)]
*  Come on, man. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2292.98s)]
*  You got to know when to show them and know when to fold them, bro. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2293.98s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2296.98s)]
*  That is. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2297.98s)]
*  He loves white people asking him on Delta One, like, so what kind of industry are you [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2298.98s)]
*  in? [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2301.98s)]
*  You just see the looks. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2302.98s)]
*  You just get the looks and I know they're trying to figure it out in their head. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2303.98s)]
*  It's like, oh, what black guy is this? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2305.98s)]
*  Really? [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2309.62s)]
*  What's fun? [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2310.62s)]
*  Why? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2311.62s)]
*  Because they're trying to understand why you can afford to be in Delta One? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2312.62s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2315.12s)]
*  That's racist. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2316.12s)]
*  Racism. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2317.12s)]
*  Racism. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2318.12s)]
*  You could sell drugs. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2319.12s)]
*  Yeah, you could be a basketball player. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2320.12s)]
*  Yeah, there's tons of things black people can do. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2321.12s)]
*  Maybe not basketball. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2323.12s)]
*  I'm going to be honest. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2324.12s)]
*  If I saw a white guy with a bunch of tattoos and goofy ass clothes and a grill, I'd be [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2325.12s)]
*  like, what the fuck is this white boy doing? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2329.12s)]

*  Big Mabu's a little scary. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2357.2599999999998s)]
*  And he goes, yo, wasn't that the kid over there that said I'm a cold guy? [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2359.2599999999998s)]

*  And I was like, Al! [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2366.4s)]
*  And I swear, Al Turner, out the corner of his eye, saw Mabu and then couldn't hear me. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2367.4s)]
*  I had to yell his name three more times. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2372.4s)]
*  I was like, yo, didn't you call Mabu a culture vulture? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2374.4s)]
*  And Al just started laughing like that and then ran down the yard to go play spikeball. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2376.4s)]
*  He's the biggest culture vulture. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2380.4s)]

*  Don't let him off the whiteboard beef. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2394.54s)]

*  We're not counting that. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2853.06s)]
*  It was an overall net loss. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2854.06s)]
*  But anyway, the boys came out and we had a great time and Dove was in adult Disney World [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2857.06s)]
*  and he found his Brazilian girls and he was just on fucking fire. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2860.06s)]
*  How did Dove and Harry, you're injured? [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=2862.06s)]

*  I was eavesdropping and I had to look busy like I worked there. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3123.78s)]
*  So I started cleaning up a table and I was pouring all the drinks into one drink and then [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3127.78s)]
*  they didn't like it. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3132.78s)]

*  Just tell us your logic. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3161.78s)]
*  When you picked up the girls' drink and you started mixing another drink into it. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3162.78s)]
*  There was 20 drinks that were half-drinking and I just started pouring them into one looking [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3166.78s)]

*  All my friends are in there. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3253.78s)]
*  This girl is a 10, a beautiful girl. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3254.78s)]
*  I was like, oh, yeah. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3256.78s)]
*  I'm so glad you asked. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3258.78s)]
*  Miles is walking up right now. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3260.78s)]
*  I was like, this is your guy. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3261.78s)]
*  Hold on one second. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3262.78s)]
*  Sorry, sorry, sorry. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3263.78s)]
*  The exact same thing happens to every one of us, by the way. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3264.78s)]
*  There are girls that are just so desperate to get into this party that they're literally [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3268.78s)]
*  at the gate. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3272.78s)]
*  It's like, have you ever been to like a Hilton where the koi fish are at there and they don't [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3273.78s)]
*  feed them because they know that like the Asians will stay there and they get excited [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3276.78s)]
*  when they see the fish. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3279.78s)]
*  So the koi fish, when you walk by, the girls are at the fence, go, right? [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3280.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3285.78s)]
*  And they're walking up, hey, can we come in with you? [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3286.78s)]
*  And when we pulled up, they were like, oh, OK, you guys are here for the party, blah, [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3288.78s)]
*  blah, blah. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3291.78s)]
*  And once they noticed that we were going to get in, they start trying to latch on. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3292.78s)]
*  And one girl asks, hey, can I go with you? [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3295.78s)]
*  Uh, I don't know. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3299.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3301.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3303.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3305.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3307.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3309.78s)]
*  I don't know what's going on. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3311.78s)]
*  She goes, yeah, I'll just go with you. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3313.78s)]
*  You guys go in. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3315.78s)]
*  She's like, I'm a girl. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3316.78s)]
*  I'll just go in. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3317.78s)]
*  He goes, yeah, I don't know. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3318.78s)]
*  She goes, can I just go in with you? [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3319.78s)]
*  He just goes, look, I don't work here. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3321.78s)]
*  That's one way to handle this situation. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3329.78s)]
*  OK? [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3332.78s)]
*  Now, the other way to handle this is you say, you know what? [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3333.78s)]
*  We're going to pretend that we're married, and I'm going to walk in with you. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3336.78s)]
*  OK? [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3339.78s)]
*  That's great. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3340.78s)]
*  I set a good thing up. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3341.78s)]
*  That's what Myles said. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3342.78s)]
*  It was a perfect setup. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3343.78s)]
*  So she goes, that's a great idea, and just locks arms with him. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3344.78s)]
*  And they start chit chatting and sort of talking about the weekend. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3345.78s)]
*  And we're all filing in. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3348.78s)]
*  And this is how hard the door is, is that a ten, a beautiful woman from New York City [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3349.78s)]
*  can't get into a party. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3353.78s)]
*  And what world does that happen? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3354.78s)]
*  Coifish. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3355.78s)]
*  And so Myles grabs her. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3356.78s)]
*  She's on his arm, and we all walk in. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3357.78s)]
*  And then he's the last one to walk in. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3360.78s)]
*  And you are kind of like saying who can get in, da da da. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3362.78s)]
*  And then you look at Myles, you go, he's good. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3364.78s)]
*  She is. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3366.78s)]
*  I know her. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3367.78s)]
*  And Shultz is like, she's also good, I guess. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3370.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3373.78s)]
*  I guess he works here. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3374.78s)]
*  And then Myles and her just walked into the party. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3375.78s)]
*  And I was like, oh, this is great. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3377.78s)]
*  This is great. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3378.78s)]
*  We have such good vibes. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3379.78s)]
*  Ratio is on ten right now. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3380.78s)]
*  And then never saw the girl again. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3382.78s)]
*  So you know how sheisty women are? [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3385.78s)]
*  She was with her friend. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3387.78s)]
*  And left her friend behind. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3388.78s)]
*  Oh god. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3390.78s)]
*  In a heartbeat. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3391.78s)]
*  Left her friend behind. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3392.78s)]
*  So that was crazy. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3393.78s)]
*  I think, was the other girl hot too? [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3395.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3397.78s)]
*  I think they both were. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3398.78s)]
*  Myles is being a little generous. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3399.78s)]
*  But I mean, she was up there. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3400.78s)]
*  For the story. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3402.78s)]
*  Yeah, for the story. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3403.78s)]
*  She was up there. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3404.78s)]
*  The friend was nice. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3405.78s)]
*  What happened though? [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3406.78s)]
*  You guys have so much chemistry going into this party. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3407.78s)]
*  I got her number, we talked, and then I was like. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3410.78s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3412.78s)]
*  Come on Myles, you gotta know it ain't using you. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3417.78s)]
*  They were using me, I knew it. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3420.78s)]
*  She's like, how long do I have to stay by his side before I can go make my move? [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3421.78s)]
*  She beat him to the door. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3426.78s)]
*  They were separate by the time they got into the house. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3429.78s)]
*  Wait, what was their excuse? [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3432.78s)]
*  Did she say like, oh, I gotta go, the guy's dick? [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3433.78s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3435.78s)]
*  But it's also funny because like, does she like, oh Myles pussy? [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3436.78s)]
*  Because they walked in together? [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3441.78s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3442.78s)]
*  I think you gotta take advantage of Myles. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3443.78s)]
*  I think you can say her name and then y'all can let her know how you feel. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3445.78s)]
*  You gotta go full Taylor remember? [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3450.78s)]
*  She has fans. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3451.78s)]

*  Dance floor. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3609.78s)]
*  It was like a...how do you describe it, Al? [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3610.78s)]
*  I mean, I was having a good time. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3613.78s)]
*  It was very cool. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3615.78s)]
*  I would be gay by the pool talking for like three hours. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3616.78s)]
*  Three hours. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3618.78s)]
*  We were having some great convos. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3619.78s)]
*  Great convos. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3621.78s)]
*  Away from the party where everything was... [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3622.78s)]
*  I'll be honest, if I have Adderall in the system, I want to pod. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3624.78s)]
*  I was trying to podcast, bro. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3629.78s)]
*  I was like, fuck all this dancing shit. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3630.78s)]
*  I need the Adderall to work through me a little bit and then we can let loose. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3631.78s)]
*  So we were talking by the pool for a little bit. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3634.78s)]
*  But when we got to the dance floor, we turned it into a mosh pit. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3636.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3642.78s)]
*  You bullied the DJ. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3643.78s)]
*  You were like, what's happening? [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3645.78s)]
*  And then Mark started flashing his iPhone just to give the request. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3647.78s)]
*  But we needed to... [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3651.78s)]
*  It was proper. We saved the party. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3652.78s)]
*  I mean, I don't want to say it. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3653.78s)]
*  I don't want to say that. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3655.78s)]
*  Don't say it again. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3658.78s)]
*  But you can say it, though. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3659.78s)]
*  I don't think we saved the party. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3660.78s)]
*  Did they save the party? [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3661.78s)]
*  For them. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3662.78s)]
*  For them? [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3663.78s)]
*  For them, for sure. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3666.78s)]
*  You gave us the crescendo you needed. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3667.78s)]
*  You needed an end on that. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3668.78s)]
*  One section of the dance floor, just jumping up and down, shirts are coming off. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3670.78s)]
*  The rest of the dance floor, kind of like that a little bit. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3674.78s)]
*  But it was fun. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3678.78s)]
*  What song? [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3679.78s)]
*  White side. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3680.78s)]
*  Mr. Brightside. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3681.78s)]
*  Oh yeah, Nirvana. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3682.78s)]
*  The White Side. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3684.78s)]
*  The final three songs. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3686.78s)]
*  Nirvana is fantastic. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3688.78s)]
*  Listen, we don't know how to do the cool shit. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3689.78s)]
*  I don't understand. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3691.78s)]
*  I don't know how to do the cool shit. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3692.78s)]
*  If we go to the party, we either podcast by the pool, or we go and fucking turn the fuck [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3693.78s)]
*  up on the dance floor. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3697.78s)]
*  I'm not going to do stupid, I'm being looked at, everybody's watching me dance moves. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3698.78s)]
*  We're either going for it and having fun, and it's going to get wild, and you're going [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3703.78s)]
*  to see girls in fucking six inch heels jumping up and down, mosh pit style. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3708.78s)]
*  They all got on board, too, and I respect that. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3713.78s)]
*  Because sometimes the girls, they want to be too cool or whatever, and there's fucking... [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3715.78s)]
*  The dope Brazilians. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3719.78s)]
*  Yeah, the Brazilians were fucking cool, but there's girls out there trying to get chose. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3720.78s)]
*  Leo's sitting in the fucking corner. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3724.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3726.78s)]
*  So those girls could go, am I the one? [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3727.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3729.78s)]
*  Or they could turn the fuck up. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3730.78s)]
*  They was turning the fuck up. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3731.78s)]
*  Leo went home empty handed. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3733.78s)]
*  Loser. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3734.78s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3735.78s)]
*  What a loser. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3736.78s)]
*  I don't think he's ever gone home empty handed. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3737.78s)]
*  Nah, you're right. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3740.78s)]
*  I think he left with Miles Girl. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3741.78s)]
*  That would be the coolest thing in the world. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3744.78s)]
*  That would be unbelievably the coolest thing in the world. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3748.78s)]
*  Yo, Miles with the John Stockton to Leo, man. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3750.78s)]
*  That's sick, actually. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3753.78s)]
*  So I just no look past. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3754.78s)]
*  Fire. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3756.78s)]
*  You stop looking, she was gone. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3757.78s)]
*  Nah, we had fun. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3759.78s)]
*  It was a good time, and I'm stoked that you all were there, and Akash, I wish you were [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3761.78s)]
*  there, bro. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3764.78s)]
*  I know. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3765.78s)]
*  Thank you so much, man. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3766.78s)]
*  Thank you for having us. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3767.78s)]
*  Thank you for having us. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3768.78s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3769.78s)]
*  That was awesome. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3770.78s)]
*  That was fire. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3771.78s)]
*  Awesome. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3772.78s)]
*  That's the only way, yeah, that's the only way I want to celebrate those things. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3773.78s)]
*  I think that's the thing, like, I don't know. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3775.78s)]
*  There's the big party out there every year, which is the white party, which is at Michael [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3780.78s)]
*  Rubin's house. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3787.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3788.78s)]
*  And I assume all these people are friends, so it makes sense that they're hanging together. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3789.78s)]
*  But the idea of not being with, if you're not friends with all those people that are [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3797.78s)]
*  The idea of not being with your friends on July 4th or on a fun weekend when you can, [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3802.78s)]
*  when everybody's off and they're trying to party, it just seems like a little bit of [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3807.78s)]
*  a mistake, in my opinion. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3811.78s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3812.78s)]
*  But if that's your community, you guys hang all the time, and then you get to let loose [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3813.78s)]
*  and rip, then that seems like a good one. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3816.78s)]
*  Did you get invited? [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3817.78s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3818.78s)]
*  I'm not cool enough to do something like that. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3819.78s)]
*  But if I was, I wouldn't want to do that over hanging out with you guys and party. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3820.78s)]
*  It's going to be the same music. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3825.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3826.78s)]
*  It's going to be the same alcohol. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3827.78s)]
*  It's more small talk. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3828.78s)]
*  There's more small talk, and I hate the fucking small talk. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3830.78s)]
*  I had my all-white outfit ready just in case we got... [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3833.78s)]
*  Just in case! [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3837.78s)]
*  I had it ready to go. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3839.78s)]
*  Not going to lie. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3840.78s)]
*  Don't ask for a plus three. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3841.78s)]
*  That'll get you banned from the party. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3842.78s)]
*  You saw that clip? [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3844.78s)]
*  Yeah, I was saying this on the thread, but the white party to me seems like dudes' Met [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3845.78s)]
*  Gala. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3850.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3851.78s)]
*  Like, everybody gets dressed up, you get super hyped. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3852.78s)]
*  It doesn't really mean anything, but getting an invite is like, you made it. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3853.78s)]
*  And then we're like, what watch is he wearing? [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3857.78s)]
*  Everybody's flexing with the watches. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3859.78s)]
*  To me, it's just the male Met Gala. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3860.78s)]
*  Now, I'd still probably go off, I got invited, because I ain't shit, but we know what it [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3862.78s)]
*  is, right? [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3866.78s)]
*  We know what time it is. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3867.78s)]
*  You're not friends with these people. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3868.78s)]
*  You're just trying to be like, I made it. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3869.78s)]
*  But I'm sure the part... [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3871.78s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3872.78s)]
*  And I'm sure that feels good. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3873.78s)]
*  There's like validation in that. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3874.78s)]
*  Yes. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3875.78s)]
*  You're like, oh, I'm at a level, et cetera. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3876.78s)]
*  So I'm sure it's incredibly flattering. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3877.78s)]
*  Like, the Met Gala thing is flattering. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3878.78s)]
*  Like, I have zero interest to go to the fucking Met Gala ever. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3880.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3883.78s)]
*  If I go, it's because my wife made me. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3884.78s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3885.78s)]
*  It's the only thing. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3886.78s)]
*  And it's important to them. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3887.78s)]
*  So that's something that you have to go. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3889.78s)]
*  But the Met Gala's on some random Monday. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3891.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3894.78s)]
*  Like, you're not doing nothing better than that on a Monday. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3895.78s)]
*  But July 4th, all your boys are going to come out, and then you're going to leave all your [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3897.78s)]
*  friends to go to this party. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3901.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3902.78s)]
*  Just so you could... [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3903.78s)]
*  It could be a good business opportunity, right? [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3904.78s)]
*  You meet good people. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3905.78s)]
*  Yes. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3906.78s)]
*  It validates the career. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3907.78s)]
*  It is great. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3908.78s)]
*  It does all those things. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3909.78s)]
*  So maybe you have to look at it like that. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3911.78s)]
*  You have to look at it like doing a show. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3912.78s)]
*  You're like, sometimes you got to perform on Christmas. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3913.78s)]
*  Sometimes you got to perform on New Year's. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3914.78s)]
*  Sometimes you got to perform on July 4th. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3915.78s)]
*  So you could look at it like that. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3916.78s)]
*  That's the smart way to look at it. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3917.78s)]
*  And maybe they're looking at it like that, too. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3918.78s)]
*  But I'm also like, if I could have 12 of my homies out east, and we could just fucking [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3919.78s)]
*  eat lobster rolls, and some of them could do lots of cocaine, and we could just laugh [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3922.78s)]
*  at each other, that's going to be so much fun. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3927.78s)]
*  For me, going to a party when I know I have a big group at that party, I came with eight [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3930.78s)]
*  guys that I can meet. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3936.78s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to go to a party. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3937.78s)]
*  I'm going to go to a party. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3938.78s)]
*  I'm going to go to a party. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3939.78s)]
*  I'm going to go to a party. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3940.78s)]
*  I came with eight guys that I can go and do my face. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3941.78s)]
*  But you know you have a home base. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3944.78s)]
*  But I have home base. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3946.78s)]
*  It's nothing. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3947.78s)]
*  The best. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3948.78s)]
*  That's probably the best. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3949.78s)]
*  Going to a party with one other dude to just kind of like... [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3950.78s)]
*  Now you feel responsible for them. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3951.78s)]
*  Oh yeah, if a couple of your friends are at the white party and you get invited, that's [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3952.78s)]
*  probably lit as fuck. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3955.78s)]
*  You're like, you're here with children. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3956.78s)]
*  I'm sure. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3957.78s)]
*  You know who likes that party the most? [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3958.78s)]
*  Athletes. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3960.78s)]
*  Or NFL and NBA that are off season. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3961.78s)]
*  And they get to really let loose right now before they go back to camp in the season. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3963.78s)]
*  And also they got a bunch of their, I imagine, homies. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3968.78s)]
*  If you're a basketball player, you've been playing with the same dude since you're 14 [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3970.78s)]
*  years old. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3973.78s)]
*  If you're an elite basketball player. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3974.78s)]
*  So it's not like these people are strangers. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3975.78s)]
*  You know? [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3977.78s)]
*  But... [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3978.78s)]
*  Good times, man. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3979.78s)]

*  Good times. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3981.78s)]
*  He's had Ferg. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3982.78s)]
*  But I will say this though. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3983.78s)]
*  Ferg was smart. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3984.78s)]
*  I was turned up. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3985.78s)]
*  Yeah, Ferg. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3986.78s)]
*  You went crazy for Ferg. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3987.78s)]
*  Far, far, far for Ferg. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3988.78s)]
*  Kind of wild. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3989.78s)]
*  I didn't even know you had that. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3990.78s)]
*  Yeah, he's nice. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3991.78s)]
*  Ferg is nice. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3992.78s)]
*  He's unbelievable. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3993.78s)]
*  He performed at that point. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3994.78s)]
*  He killed that shit. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3995.78s)]
*  But yeah, it was... [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3996.78s)]
*  I'll tell you this though. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3998.78s)]
*  I only got two days of partying left in me now. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=3999.78s)]
*  Well, we're total? [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4001.78s)]
*  I got... [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4002.78s)]
*  No, no, like I could party... [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4003.78s)]
*  Forever? [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4005.78s)]
*  Yeah, dog. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4006.78s)]
*  No. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4007.78s)]
*  I could party for two days and then I'm like my body can't produce serotonin anymore. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4008.78s)]
*  Like it just runs out of happiness. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4012.78s)]
*  I was in bed all day yesterday. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4013.78s)]
*  I woke up, I ate, I went back to sleep. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4015.78s)]
*  That was all day yesterday. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4018.78s)]
*  See, I want to do that but then my wife would be looking at me crazy like, you partied and [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4019.78s)]
*  now you're not hanging out with your daughter? [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4023.78s)]
*  So I'm like, all right, I'm gonna be tired all day just to prove you wrong. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4025.78s)]
*  Let's see who naps first. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4028.78s)]
*  But I knew I showed up late because when I got back that night, my wife was pumping. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4032.78s)]
*  Oh, yay. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4037.78s)]
*  So she was pumping her breasts. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4038.78s)]
*  She was like getting the milk out in the middle of the night and I was like, oh fuck. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4039.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4043.78s)]
*  Imagine the way she's looking at you like, God damn, you're just getting in. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4044.78s)]
*  I'm sitting here being a mom this whole time. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4046.78s)]
*  Yeah, dumbass. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4048.78s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4050.78s)]
*  I chose the wrong gender. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4051.78s)]
*  Anyway, so that was fun. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4053.78s)]
*  What else we got going on, boys? [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4055.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4057.78s)]

*  Yeah, it is my greatest bomb ever. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4072.78s)]
*  2012 show for just Indian, specific type of Indians called Kanaat Catholics. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4074.78s)]

*  I'm gonna crush. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4080.78s)]
*  I eat the biggest dick I've ever eaten for an hour straight. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4081.78s)]
*  Someone's literally falling asleep in the front row. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4084.78s)]
*  Horrible setup, et cetera, et cetera. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4086.78s)]
*  This time they asked me back. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4088.78s)]
*  They say, we've heard that you tell this story, we want to make things right. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4089.78s)]
*  So I'm like, okay, I'm going there and the setup needs to be great. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4093.78s)]
*  And if it's not, I might just take my fucking check and go home. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4097.780000000001s)]
*  And they're like, fine. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4100.780000000001s)]
*  So I fly down there the morning of and the setup is fucked. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4101.780000000001s)]
*  I mean, they took none of the things that I asked for. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4104.780000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4107.780000000001s)]
*  So I'm walking into, it's at the San Antonio Convention Center, whatever Gonzales. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4108.78s)]
*  And I remember when I saw the address, they put me in a hotel, [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4112.78s)]
*  and I assumed the show would be at the hotel, like four or five hundred people. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4114.78s)]
*  I'm at a convention center. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4117.78s)]
*  I'm like, that seems like a big room. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4118.78s)]
*  And they tell me on the way up, they're like, oh, we're expecting a pretty good turnout, [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4119.78s)]
*  like maybe 500, maybe even a thousand people. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4122.78s)]
*  And I'm like, okay, cool. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4124.78s)]
*  I walk into the room, dead ass, I see 3,000 chairs. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4125.78s)]
*  This room is a hundred yards long. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4129.78s)]
*  It's massive. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4130.78s)]
*  This is where Tony Robbins or Tony Roberts, whatever his name is, would give a speech. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4131.78s)]
*  The motivational guy. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4135.78s)]
*  It's a fucking arena side. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4136.78s)]
*  You're doing theaters at least if you're here. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4137.78s)]
*  You would do a show there and be like, all right, cool. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4140.78s)]
*  I can sell this out. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4142.78s)]
*  Like 3,000 chairs. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4143.78s)]
*  That's a lot of people, especially in a convention center. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4144.78s)]
*  There's like, it's just. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4146.78s)]
*  Slap and long. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4148.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4149.78s)]
*  Horrible setup. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4150.78s)]
*  There's a 20-foot gap between me and the front row of the audience. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4151.78s)]
*  I sent Andrew a video. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4154.78s)]
*  I'm freaking out how big the room is. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4156.78s)]
*  So I start arguing with everything. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4157.78s)]
*  It looks like the NFL draft. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4159.78s)]
*  Dead ass. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4160.78s)]
*  Dead ass is a massive room. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4161.78s)]
*  And if there's 500 people showing, they're not going to all sit at the front. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4164.78s)]
*  They're going to go sit scattered everywhere. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4166.78s)]
*  It's going to be the worst show ever. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4168.78s)]
*  But they told you where it was the day of. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4169.78s)]
*  You didn't know. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4171.78s)]
*  They said convention center, but I don't know what room it is. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4172.78s)]
*  So I remember thinking, I'm like, I think it's like a small room in the convention center. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4174.78s)]
*  Because last time it was in a hotel. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4177.78s)]
*  So I'm thinking it can't be that much bigger. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4179.78s)]
*  I don't realize I'm 40 and 12 years past. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4181.78s)]
*  It's a way different thing now. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4184.78s)]
*  And what they did, they have like 3,000 people sign up for the conference. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4186.78s)]
*  And one of the events has everybody. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4189.78s)]
*  So they just have one room. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4191.78s)]
*  They set up chairs for that event. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4192.78s)]
*  And they're like, we're not going to change it. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4194.78s)]
*  So I start going fucking nuts, yelling at everybody. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4196.78s)]
*  I'm thinking about Andrew. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4198.78s)]
*  And I'm like, what I would normally do is just be like, all right, well, I'll just make the best show I can make out of this. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4199.78s)]
*  And then I'm like, no, fuck that. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4204.78s)]
*  So I start arguing. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4205.78s)]
*  They have two air walls. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4206.78s)]
*  One can cut off like 20% of the room. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4207.78s)]
*  That's great. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4209.78s)]
*  I'm like, OK, cool. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4210.78s)]
*  That's manageable. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4211.78s)]
*  They say we can do that. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4212.78s)]
*  There's another one that could cut off 40% of the room. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4213.78s)]
*  Now, if we can get that closed, we're cooking. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4215.78s)]
*  So I'm for four hours. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4217.78s)]
*  I'm arguing with everybody. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4219.78s)]
*  Close this fucking wall. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4220.78s)]
*  Close this fucking wall. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4221.78s)]
*  Finally, they kick it up the chain of command. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4222.78s)]
*  They're like, all right, we're going to give in. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4224.78s)]
*  We're going to close this wall. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4225.78s)]
*  Don't worry about it. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4226.78s)]
*  They move the whole night around. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4227.78s)]
*  20 minutes before the show, they're like, hey, we can't close that wall. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4229.78s)]
*  So I'm like, we still are going to have like 800 extra chairs, probably. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4232.78s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4237.78s)]
*  I got to try to make this work. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4238.78s)]
*  I'm not seeing the line. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4239.78s)]
*  And this was a cool part. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4241.78s)]
*  Kev was out there and he was like, man, I wish I taped it. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4242.78s)]
*  When they opened the doors, people fucking sprinted to get to the best seats. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4245.78s)]
*  It was a Black Friday sale or something. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4248.78s)]
*  So then I'm feeling a little better. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4249.78s)]
*  Oh, this is a good story. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4251.78s)]
*  It's a good story. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4252.78s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4253.78s)]
*  So then I get on stage and the set isn't perfect. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4254.78s)]
*  It's a hard show to really crush in. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4258.78s)]
*  It's still a lot of kids who haven't really seen a comedy show. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4260.78s)]
*  It's still not a great setup. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4262.78s)]
*  I don't crush by any stretch, but I definitely don't bomb like I thought I would. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4263.78s)]
*  Yeah, it was an upgrade. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4267.78s)]
*  Yeah, it was a massive upgrade. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4268.78s)]
*  And they were so hyped to see me. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4270.78s)]
*  It was the coolest fucking thing. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4271.78s)]
*  Every chair pretty much is full, which I was like, yo, they expected 500 or 1,000. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4272.78s)]
*  We got like 50 or 2,000. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4276.78s)]
*  Everybody. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4277.78s)]
*  Man, people came out. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4278.78s)]
*  Auntie's were coming up. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4279.78s)]
*  And then after, dog, I got emotional. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4280.78s)]
*  Like when I went back, I got mobbed. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4282.78s)]
*  I felt like a fucking, for 15 minutes, I felt like this is what a Bollywood star feels like. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4283.78s)]
*  Man, people trying to take pictures. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4287.78s)]
*  I'm just doing selfie, selfie, selfie. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4289.78s)]
*  So it ended up being a fucking awesome story and I'm really glad I went. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4291.78s)]
*  But if I went to 4th of July and then I just showed up right before the show, I would have eaten dick again. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4294.78s)]
*  So I ended up being a mess. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4300.78s)]
*  I'm so thankful to, shout out to Joven Thomas, who I was on him. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4301.78s)]
*  I was on him all the time, calling, calling, calling. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4305.78s)]
*  And he was, he was setting up the room. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4308.78s)]
*  In my heart, I'm happy that you got your redemption. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4309.78s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4311.78s)]
*  I know you are. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4312.78s)]
*  But in my head, I wish you had a worse story. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4313.78s)]
*  That is friendship right there. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4317.78s)]
*  But in my heart, I am happy. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4319.78s)]
*  That is brotherhood. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4321.78s)]
*  I hope you sprain your back again. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4322.78s)]
*  You never get to play again. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4323.78s)]
*  I was thinking literally, I swear to God, I told my wife this morning. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4325.78s)]
*  That should have warned me, just saying that. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4328.78s)]
*  I told my wife this morning. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4329.78s)]
*  I was like, I'm going to start playing paddle just so I can play with Andrew. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4330.78s)]
*  I know quality time means a lot to my friend. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4334.78s)]
*  I just realized this. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4336.78s)]
*  I haven't been doing that enough. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4337.78s)]
*  I'm going to learn paddle to play with him. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4338.78s)]
*  And now I hope you break your foot and I never have to play with you again. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4340.78s)]
*  I just, that's what I hope. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4347.78s)]
*  In my head, my heart is saying something different. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4349.78s)]
*  I love you too, bro. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4351.78s)]
*  I love you too, bro. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4352.78s)]
*  I love you, Doug. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4354.78s)]
*  Okay, so it worked out. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4355.78s)]
*  It was great. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4356.78s)]
*  Yeah, it ended up being a fantastic experience. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4357.78s)]
*  I got to see my mom the day before. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4358.78s)]
*  It was nice. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4359.78s)]
*  But, did she come to the show? [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4360.78s)]
*  No, I just flew down early, trying to help them move and stuff. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4361.78s)]
*  But I don't ever get to see my folks anymore. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4363.78s)]
*  Did you know a lot about this sect of... [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4365.78s)]
*  I did not before the last show. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4367.78s)]
*  And now you've learned a bit. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4369.78s)]
*  And now I know a little bit more. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4370.78s)]
*  But I was asking them stuff. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4371.78s)]
*  And I was like, so here's basics I know. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4372.78s)]
*  You guys really are only allowed to marry each other. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4374.78s)]
*  People call you inbred. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4376.78s)]
*  I know you're alcoholics. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4377.78s)]
*  I know it started in Syria. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4379.78s)]
*  And then they were like, the first two things, pretty much all you need to know. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4381.78s)]
*  The Syria part don't even matter. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4384.78s)]
*  So there's just a sect of Catholics that everybody that knows about them looks at. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4386.78s)]
*  And it's like, they're weird. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4392.78s)]
*  And they're okay with that. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4393.78s)]
*  Because they're doing their own thing. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4394.78s)]
*  They're like, that's fine. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4395.78s)]
*  We get it. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4396.78s)]
*  Y'all can laugh at us. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4397.78s)]
*  Are there any distinguishing characteristics that we would know about them? [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4398.78s)]
*  No, I can't even... [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4400.78s)]
*  I know they're from Kerala. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4401.78s)]
*  So like we call them Malus because they speak Malayalam. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4403.78s)]
*  So every person that's Kanaat Catholic is Malu, but not every Malu is Kanaat Catholic. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4406.78s)]
*  They're like a section of... [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4411.78s)]
*  For whatever reason, they got converted this other way. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4413.78s)]
*  And I don't even... [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4416.78s)]
*  When I asked them what the other beliefs were, they didn't really have a good answer for me. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4417.78s)]
*  So I don't know. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4420.78s)]
*  Maybe they just didn't want to explain it to me 30 minutes before a show. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4421.78s)]
*  But yeah, if you see someone who looks like he married his cousin... [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4424.78s)]
*  So this is like the Indian version of the Curleys in Brooklyn? [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4428.78s)]
*  Like that? [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4431.78s)]
*  But Christian. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4432.78s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4433.78s)]
*  That's how we look at them. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4434.78s)]
*  But they drink way more. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4435.78s)]
*  Oh, so they're fun. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4437.78s)]
*  They're rung. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4438.78s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4439.78s)]
*  Is it... [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4440.78s)]
*  Like... [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4443.78s)]
*  How do I say this? [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4444.78s)]
*  It seems like... [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4445.78s)]
*  It seems like... [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4446.78s)]
*  I wanted to say it was just Indians, but there's other places where they're like really good at like community. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4447.78s)]
*  And like maintaining community. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4452.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4454.78s)]
*  And is it just a Western thing where that is for whatever reason less important or maybe... [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4455.78s)]
*  You know what I think it is? [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4461.78s)]
*  Hindus are not as good as other communities because we get persecuted less. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4462.78s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4466.78s)]
*  The hatred bonds you. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4468.78s)]
*  Jewish people are very tight because they get persecuted every 100 years. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4470.78s)]
*  Sick people, my wife's side, very tight. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4472.78s)]
*  They get persecuted. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4474.78s)]
*  So answer me this though. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4475.78s)]
*  If you go to England and you go to like the North, there are these distinct cities that are separated by fucking 30-minute car ride. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4476.78s)]
*  But culturally, completely different. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4485.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4487.78s)]
*  Like Liverpool and Manchester, or how far? [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4488.78s)]
*  From half hour, an hour? [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4490.78s)]
*  An hour. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4492.78s)]
*  An hour and a half. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4493.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4494.78s)]
*  But like... [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4495.78s)]
*  An hour, hour and a half, yeah. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4496.78s)]
*  They're like... [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4497.78s)]
*  They think that they are colder opposites. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4498.78s)]
*  I took an Uber from one city to the other for shows and the guy was like, I never come over here. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4499.78s)]
*  I should. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4502.78s)]
*  He's like, dog, it's an hour. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4503.78s)]
*  So what does that? [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4504.78s)]
*  Like what unites... [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4505.78s)]
*  How do you get like a tribal aspect? [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4506.78s)]
*  Is that just like thousands of years of history? [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4509.78s)]
*  Yeah, I have thousands of years. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4511.78s)]
*  And then since America, we're so young, that exists when the tribal people come here. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4513.78s)]
*  But the people that have been here for a while just start to kind of... [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4518.78s)]
*  And probably back then when they formed the communities, you couldn't get... [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4521.78s)]
*  There was no cars to drive an hour and a half to Liverpool. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4524.78s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4526.78s)]
*  So it really solidifies... [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4527.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4528.78s)]
*  Yeah, that makes sense. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4529.78s)]
*  And then the black people here, unfortunately, are stripped from their past. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4531.78s)]
*  Yeah, and they get persecuted a lot, so I think there's a lot of black people... [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4535.78s)]
*  But also some of your tribesmen have sucked and now you're like, you don't have to do that. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4537.78s)]
*  You know we're all lit, come on, bro. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4541.78s)]
*  No, I don't know. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4543.78s)]
*  I mean, some tribes sold, y'all. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4545.78s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4547.78s)]
*  They're probably not lit. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4548.78s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4549.78s)]
*  Dude. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4550.78s)]
*  Believe that. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4551.78s)]
*  I expect a double down. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4552.78s)]
*  I expect a double down. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4554.78s)]
*  That is the only way out, really. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4556.78s)]
*  That is an awesome form of marketing. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4558.78s)]
*  Like, who is... [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4560.78s)]
*  Like, wipe that from the history books. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4564.78s)]
*  What part? [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4567.78s)]
*  The blacks selling the blacks. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4568.78s)]
*  No one wiped that. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4570.78s)]
*  You guys love to point that out every time the slavery combo comes up. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4571.78s)]
*  Just me. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4574.78s)]
*  I know, everybody loves to. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4575.78s)]
*  Just I. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4577.78s)]
*  Everybody loves to point that out. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4578.78s)]
*  But we still can't name a dude. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4579.78s)]
*  Like, we don't know who the biggest seller of black people was in... [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4581.78s)]
*  Shifty's leaving, he's like, I can't be bothered. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4584.78s)]
*  We also don't know the biggest buyer. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4586.78s)]
*  I think we do. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4588.78s)]
*  We know the group, but we don't know... [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4589.78s)]
*  Brazil, I think they had the most... [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4591.78s)]
*  And they were picking the fucking cream of the crop. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4596.78s)]
*  Because those Brazilians, right? [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4599.78s)]
*  They didn't do much with it, to be honest. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4601.78s)]
*  Well, because they were so hot. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4603.78s)]
*  The second they bent down to pick the cotton, they were like, what's up with that thing? [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4605.78s)]
*  My back, son. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4610.78s)]
*  Hold on, I pulled my back again. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4611.78s)]
*  Brazil on bending down? [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4613.78s)]
*  I gotta pee real quick. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4616.78s)]
*  Okay, we take a little break. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4617.78s)]
*  And we are back. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4618.78s)]
*  It looks like the apparel spritzes have begun. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4619.78s)]
*  We're not letting go of summer. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4622.78s)]
*  We are just beginning. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4624.78s)]
*  We're just getting started. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4625.78s)]
*  We are just warming up. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4627.78s)]
*  You want another Zen dog? [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4628.78s)]
*  No, no, I got one. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4630.78s)]
*  You know there's a Zen shortage in New York City? [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4631.78s)]
*  I believe it. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4632.78s)]
*  People don't have Zens anymore. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4633.78s)]
*  I believe it. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4634.78s)]
*  Where are they going to? [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4635.78s)]
*  I'm just vaping and shit, but also trying to get Zens on the low. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4636.78s)]
*  Now people are Zen dealing. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4639.78s)]
*  They got the Zen dealers that are getting them wholesale, driving them in, and they're just slaying them for upcharge. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4640.78s)]
*  It's like masks during a pandemic. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4644.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4646.78s)]
*  Okay, so we gotta get our hands on some Zens. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4647.78s)]
*  I want to talk about this You Said That Not Like Us video. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4653.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4656.78s)]
*  What did y'all think about it? [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4657.78s)]
*  I mean, it's fire. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4658.78s)]
*  Did you like it? [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4659.78s)]
*  It's a fantastic video. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4660.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's fantastic. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4661.78s)]
*  I didn't like it. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4662.78s)]
*  I thought it was a little weak. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4663.78s)]
*  Really? [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4664.78s)]
*  I thought it was like the metaphors were really overhanded. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4665.78s)]
*  Which ones? [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4668.78s)]
*  They were like, say a line and then like act out the line. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4669.78s)]
*  It was like hide the Bible, something to watch. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4672.78s)]
*  And it's like, there's a Bible and I'll hide it. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4675.78s)]
*  Like it was so deliberate that I thought it took away. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4677.78s)]
*  Like the nice thing about showing something is that you don't also have to tell it. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4681.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4685.78s)]
*  And yeah, I don't know. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4686.78s)]
*  I just felt like there was a bunch of those moments where it was like very deliberate. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4689.78s)]
*  I thought it looked beautiful. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4693.78s)]
*  Kev said it was. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4695.78s)]
*  It just looks fucking clean. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4696.78s)]
*  Like the shipping containers, clean, white. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4698.78s)]
*  Also, there's a lot of that underhanded type shit, like the shipping containers. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4701.78s)]
*  If you're going to say Drake, Travick's and women. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4705.78s)]
*  Oh, God. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4708.78s)]
*  Okay. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4709.78s)]
*  Well, there's some metaphor that I didn't see. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4710.78s)]
*  And maybe I'm just like a fool looking at it, but there's a few lines that I thought were like, [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4711.78s)]
*  and the actual line that he wraps is showcase. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4714.78s)]
*  The action is showcased at the exact same time. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4719.78s)]
*  And I thought that that was just a little. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4722.78s)]
*  Some of the stuff I've. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4724.78s)]
*  I thought it was like a little bit of a [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4726.78s)]
*  metaphor for how elegant he is when it comes to like his metaphors and how artistic he is with his rapping. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4728.78s)]
*  I thought it was quite pedestrian. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4736.78s)]
*  Like an old school Eminem video. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4739.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4741.78s)]
*  Every little part. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4742.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4743.78s)]
*  It's like Pam Anderson is here and then Pam Anderson pops up. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4744.78s)]
*  Like, yeah. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4746.78s)]
*  I guess the reason why I was a little underwhelmed was because the concert. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4748.78s)]
*  He's breaking all of L.A. out and you were just going to see so much of L.A. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4754.78s)]
*  A lot of it was just. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4757.78s)]
*  He brought every human and Compton out. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4758.78s)]
*  It just didn't feel like a celebration. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4760.78s)]
*  It felt like it was it's about me. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4762.78s)]
*  And then, you know, I'll flash to moments of where I show everyone else. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4764.78s)]
*  But on stage, that one big moment, like I thought it was going to be more of that. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4768.78s)]
*  So I guess, yeah. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4772.78s)]
*  Oh, I thought this was a whole showcase of Compton and West Coast. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4773.78s)]
*  He did. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4777.78s)]
*  Like in everything, there's a West Coast touch. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4778.78s)]
*  So some of this stuff, I don't know what's what's true and what's not. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4780.78s)]
*  Some of the stuff that's supposed to be more subtle, some of it, I for sure believe, [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4783.78s)]
*  like the guy who's wearing the wife beater and the overalls that Kendrick gives five to, [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4787.78s)]
*  he's dressed like the Metro, I think, and the like that. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4790.78s)]
*  I like when him in future have the album cover. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4794.78s)]
*  It's like almost the exact same outfit. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4796.78s)]
*  There's some people who say the gray suit he wears in front of the shipping container looks very similar to the one R. Kelly wears in his interview. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4798.78s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, killing me with this shit. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4805.78s)]
*  I don't know if that's real or not. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4807.78s)]
*  But it's not. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4809.78s)]
*  He does. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4810.78s)]
*  Well, I think he's again, if you're doing it, they're looting the trafficking. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4811.78s)]
*  Him and his wife dancing like that was awesome. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4814.78s)]
*  That was fire. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4818.78s)]
*  Like that's like an illusion to the family matters, I think. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4819.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's like 80s sitcom vibes. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4822.78s)]
*  And it's like, oh, you want to talk old sitcom. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4824.78s)]
*  But if you're going to say this stuff about my wife, having her in the video with a wife beater is also a very funny touch. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4826.78s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4834.78s)]
*  That's good. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4835.78s)]
*  I don't know if that's a sea walk or fucking whatever L.A. dance that is. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4836.78s)]
*  But she's killing it. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4840.78s)]
*  Good dancer. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4842.78s)]
*  And I think that was a direct fuck you to people who are going to be like, I think he's responding to me being like, it's not about Drake being white. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4843.78s)]
*  It's about being in touch with the culture. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4848.78s)]
*  And y'all are saying my wife is mixed race, whatever. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4850.78s)]
*  I don't care about the race. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4852.78s)]
*  It's the cultural aspect. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4853.78s)]
*  My wife is in touch culturally. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4854.78s)]
*  I think she Crip walks on the hopscotch thing during the A minor line. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4856.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4860.78s)]
*  I don't think it's Helen Crip walk either. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4861.78s)]
*  I don't know if she's Hoover stomping or Crip walk or whatever, but she's doing some L.A. shit in that dance. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4862.78s)]
*  And I think it's like it's not about the race. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4868.78s)]
*  It's about the culture. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4870.78s)]
*  She's a part of the culture. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4871.78s)]
*  You're not. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4872.78s)]
*  And releasing it on Independence Day. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4873.78s)]
*  Apparently, who do we get freedom from? [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4874.78s)]
*  The colonizers on Independence Day, which I thought was fire, too. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4876.78s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4879.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4880.78s)]
*  It's directed by Dave Free. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4881.78s)]
*  Oh, that's his boy. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4883.78s)]
*  And at the end, they made that a big thing. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4884.78s)]
*  Directed by Kendrick and Dave Free. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4886.78s)]
*  It was like the first thing that pops up. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4888.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4889.78s)]
*  Drake was saying that's like the baby mama. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4890.78s)]
*  Yeah, the baby daddy. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4892.78s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4893.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4894.78s)]
*  I just saw it and I was like, I thought it was fine. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4895.78s)]
*  And I was ready for it to be majestic. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4898.78s)]
*  You wanted more artistry or like the subtle stuff that we know Kendrick to do. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4902.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4908.78s)]
*  It was almost like, hey, look, I have a good relationship with my wife and family. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4909.78s)]
*  I think you got to be over and heavy handed with that. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4916.78s)]
*  I don't know if you have to because I think in a way, like showing that means that you feel you have to address it. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4919.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4930.78s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4933.78s)]
*  It's like... [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4934.78s)]
*  But when you're doing the victory lap, I don't mind him addressing it now. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4935.78s)]
*  Fair enough. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4939.78s)]
*  If he didn't immediately... [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4940.78s)]
*  Because Drake was trying to address it during and that's actually... [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4941.78s)]
*  That's fair. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4943.78s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4944.78s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4945.78s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4946.78s)]
*  If somebody says you're gay and you're like, I get so much pussy, like it's corny. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4947.78s)]
*  But if you win the battle and then you show off all the things you got. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4951.78s)]
*  Okay. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4955.78s)]
*  I had to look at it through that perspective. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4956.78s)]
*  I got that one. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4957.78s)]
*  You got the Rosen in the video. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4958.78s)]
*  That was also... [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4959.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4960.78s)]
*  That was a big move. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4961.78s)]
*  And I'm curious how Toronto will feel about that because Toronto... [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4962.78s)]
*  Again, this is something we talked about with Ak. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4967.78s)]
*  Everybody turning on Drake can't just be everybody being a Fairweather fan. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4970.78s)]
*  It can't just be that. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4974.78s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4975.78s)]
*  If you got no allies left, it can't be that everybody sucks and you're good. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4976.78s)]
*  I will say this. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4980.78s)]
*  If there's one thing this weekend told me is that Drake is going to be just fine. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4981.78s)]
*  I'm sure. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4985.78s)]
*  Just fine. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4986.78s)]
*  Is it? [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4987.78s)]
*  Every time the Drake song comes on, everybody's saying every single word. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4988.78s)]
*  It's still so much fun to dance to. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4992.78s)]
*  The guy's got a catalog that's so fucking deep, it's untouchable. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4994.78s)]
*  He's going to be just fine. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=4997.78s)]
*  In that aspect of things, yes. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5000.78s)]
*  But imagine being at the Michael Rubin White Party and people are taking their phones [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5003.78s)]
*  out watching Kendrick's video that just dropped. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5008.78s)]
*  Oh. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5011.78s)]
*  That was... [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5012.78s)]
*  That was actually happening. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5013.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5016.78s)]
*  While he was there. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5017.78s)]
*  That he's there. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5018.78s)]
*  That's why he looks so sad. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5019.78s)]
*  That's why he looks a little sad in the pictures. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5020.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5021.78s)]
*  Imagine. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5022.78s)]
*  It's also stressful knowing if you invite Drake to any party, you have to tell the DJ [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5023.78s)]
*  he can't play this song, even though it's the song of the summer. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5027.78s)]
*  It's almost like annoying, I guess, having Drake there in that regard. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5031.78s)]
*  But I think that this goes away. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5035.78s)]
*  The biggest rap diss I ever remember was Ether. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5038.78s)]
*  Right? [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5042.78s)]
*  Nas absolutely lobotomized Jay-Z with Ether. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5043.78s)]
*  Jay-Z is... [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5048.78s)]
*  He was fine. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5049.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5050.78s)]
*  Jay-Z is fine. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5051.78s)]
*  He's fine. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5052.78s)]
*  Now, granted, the things Nas was saying were less sticky. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5053.78s)]
*  Yeah, they were very surface level. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5056.78s)]
*  You're gay. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5057.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5058.78s)]
*  Whatever like that. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5059.78s)]
*  I've found that trend has seemed to kind of lock in. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5060.78s)]
*  People are just thinking this of Drake. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5065.78s)]
*  Even though they know it's not real, it's real enough to where it kind of sticks. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5068.78s)]
*  It's like the Clinton body count. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5074.78s)]
*  Like is Hillary and Bill... [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5078.78s)]
*  If we're actually being serious, are Hillary and Bill having a conversation like, yo, murder [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5080.78s)]
*  that person and then like, are they the ones that are shot calling and then there's this [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5084.78s)]
*  big mafia family? [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5088.78s)]
*  I doubt it. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5089.78s)]
*  Are they involved with people that maybe if these individuals released this information, [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5091.78s)]
*  it would affect more than Bill and Hillary and then maybe they ended up murdering somebody? [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5098.78s)]
*  Possible. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5104.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5105.78s)]
*  But again, I don't know. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5106.78s)]
*  But it is just accepted that Bill and Hillary got a list of bodies and they're out there [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5109.78s)]
*  murdering motherfuckers. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5115.78s)]
*  And that's just, it's accepted. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5116.78s)]
*  But anytime you see Bill or Hillary, nobody's walking up and be like, you kill people. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5117.78s)]
*  They're like, oh my God, Bill, let me get a picture. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5121.78s)]
*  So I wonder if this is just going to be a narrative that's accepted and goes along with [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5123.78s)]
*  Drake. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5127.78s)]
*  But when the music comes on, the music is great. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5128.78s)]
*  I think Drake the pop star is fine. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5130.78s)]
*  Drake the pop star is going to be okay. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5132.78s)]
*  People are going to sing along. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5134.78s)]
*  Drake, the greatest rapper ever, that took a hit. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5136.78s)]
*  Oh. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5139.78s)]
*  And I would say the verse that hurt, the accusation that hurt the most, like the pedophile stuff, [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5140.78s)]
*  most people are going to be like, that's so ridiculous. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5144.78s)]
*  It's so out there. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5146.78s)]
*  I just can't bring myself to believe it. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5147.78s)]
*  What I think will hurt him the most is the Atlanta verse. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5149.78s)]
*  The colonizer verse, I think is the one that sticks to him the most. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5151.78s)]
*  Because Jay-Z, nobody ever was like, you didn't grow up in Bed-Stuy. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5155.78s)]
*  You're not a part of the culture. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5158.78s)]
*  You didn't sell drugs. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5160.78s)]
*  Nobody questioned Jay-Z's authenticity ever. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5161.78s)]
*  Drake already had that. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5164.78s)]
*  And now it's not only are you not authentic, you actually just used us to get ahead. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5166.78s)]
*  Where the narrative used to be Drake puts everyone on, now it's turned to Drake is using you to qualify himself [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5171.78s)]
*  so that we don't see him as a Jewish kid from Canada. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5178.78s)]
*  Yes. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5182.78s)]
*  And that was a big flip. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5183.78s)]
*  That is a big, big flip. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5185.78s)]
*  The biggest flip in this whole thing. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5187.78s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great point. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5189.78s)]
*  The pedophile one is the, I mean for lack of a better word, the most hilarious. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5190.78s)]
*  It's the most salacious. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5195.78s)]
*  It's the easiest one to pick on. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5197.78s)]
*  It's the easiest one to poke at. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5198.78s)]
*  But the actual damage could be done relationship-wise. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5200.78s)]
*  But at the same time, if you're a young and up-and-coming rapper and Drake wants to give you a feature, you're not saying no. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5207.78s)]
*  Like, who could say no? [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5212.78s)]
*  No, you're not, but the people might look at it differently. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5214.78s)]
*  There's a video of Anthony Edwards, who's I think from Atlanta, and he's like the coolest basketball player to Americans right now, [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5215.78s)]
*  rapping that third verse word for word to his homie, holding the phone, like, check this out. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5221.78s)]
*  This is what he's saying. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5226.78s)]
*  You run to Atlanta with like, that perception is there now. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5227.78s)]
*  That's a good-ass point. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5230.78s)]
*  I think you said, or Ak, you repeated something Ak said, but the Drake stimulus package is over. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5232.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5238.78s)]
*  Like, if Ak, his biggest fan, is saying that, that's telling. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5239.78s)]
*  I think he's going to be fine, bro. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5244.78s)]
*  I know it sounds crazy, but I think this song will obviously run through summer. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5246.78s)]
*  By the end of summer, it's fine. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5251.78s)]
*  And then it just goes back into the songs that you've heard before. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5253.78s)]
*  You're a DJ. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5256.78s)]
*  You got to play 200 songs in a night. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5257.78s)]
*  You really not going to play Drake? [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5259.78s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5261.78s)]
*  You really not going to play Drake? [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5262.78s)]
*  You're going to play Drake? [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5263.78s)]
*  This is hyperbolic, but again, this is hyperbolic, but do we look at him in the same general galaxy as a Nelly? [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5264.78s)]
*  Where it's like, yeah, I'm going to dance to your shit. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5272.78s)]
*  It's going to play at a club, but I'm not looking at Nelly as like a go-rapper. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5275.78s)]
*  No, I think we look at him as... [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5280.78s)]
*  And if we don't know what you wrote and what you didn't. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5284.78s)]
*  I don't even think people are caring about that that much. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5287.78s)]
*  Maybe they don't care about that more because we're comics and it's such a thing. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5291.78s)]
*  Yeah, but I think that's been out there, and I don't think we care more about that now because of this. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5294.78s)]
*  I think that's peaks. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5300.78s)]
*  But I do think your point about the, I'm just using these people for a cool sample of approval. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5302.78s)]
*  Whereas we used to look at it as the biggest rapper in the world is cosigning. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5309.78s)]
*  Like that's a great fucking point. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5313.78s)]
*  Yeah, and they cut off a channel for him. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5315.78s)]
*  Yeah, and a channel that was really helpful. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5317.78s)]
*  And he has a bunch of other channels. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5320.78s)]
*  He'll be fine with those other channels, but that channel. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5321.78s)]
*  That was a big one. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5324.78s)]
*  And that's really necessary for someone in rap. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5325.78s)]
*  The streets got to cosign you, and he had that. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5329.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's an interesting, I don't know, but I think like, [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5332.78s)]
*  I'm trying to find an equal example of someone else in music that went through something like this, [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5336.78s)]
*  but the music still prevails. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5342.78s)]
*  Like, it's hard to say where the music still prevails because like, 50 jobs. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5345.78s)]
*  I mean, Michael had the worst. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5351.78s)]
*  He literally had that shit. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5353.78s)]
*  Like, kids coming out. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5355.78s)]
*  I mean, Mike slaps no matter what. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5357.78s)]
*  That's true. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5360.78s)]
*  And Mike ain't right as shit. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5361.78s)]
*  Pop artists, it's expected. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5364.78s)]
*  There's a different expectation. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5366.78s)]
*  Frank Snatcher didn't write his shit. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5367.78s)]
*  I get it, 100%. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5369.78s)]
*  But I think as time goes on, you remember how those Drake songs made you feel, [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5370.78s)]
*  and they encapsulate a certain time in the same way food does. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5377.78s)]
*  Like, pumpkin pie is Christmas and Thanksgiving. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5380.78s)]
*  It reminds you of being a kid, and it's Thanksgiving, and your grandma's there. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5383.78s)]
*  Whatever these things happen, I think the same thing happens with music. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5387.78s)]
*  It just gets intertwined with your life and how you felt in these certain times. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5390.78s)]
*  I'm sure that's why Taylor Swift is so huge. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5394.78s)]
*  She just fucking makes it happen. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5396.78s)]
*  And the more frivolous music, sometimes it succeeds, and sometimes it just goes away. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5398.78s)]
*  And I think Drake has got those songs where you're just like, [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5403.78s)]
*  oh, this is how I feel, and I'm fucking rapping this shit. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5405.78s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think anything hurts his back, Kettlewap. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5408.78s)]
*  It's just what happens moving forward. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5410.78s)]
*  Okay, fair, fair. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5412.78s)]
*  What about his standing as, when you're talking about greatest rappers ever, [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5413.78s)]
*  where does he fall now? [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5416.78s)]
*  I should have generation, bro. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5418.78s)]
*  If anything, he's never going to be higher than number two. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5420.78s)]
*  But like, isn't that, I agree, but only within your, I feel like that's within your generation. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5423.78s)]
*  It's the same thing with basketball. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5430.78s)]
*  These kids that grew up with LeBron, they only think LeBron is the greatest. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5433.78s)]
*  They literally do not think Michael is. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5436.78s)]
*  And why would they? They never saw Michael do what we saw him do. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5438.78s)]
*  And I think the same thing exists with music, where it's just like, [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5441.78s)]
*  this generation might go, all right, Kendrick was number one and Drake's number two. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5444.78s)]
*  And that's how they might remember it. And that's totally fine. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5449.78s)]
*  But the next generation is already on someone else. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5452.78s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, Kendrick ain't number one and neither is Drake. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5455.78s)]
*  This guy is number one. I don't know who the new... [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5459.78s)]
*  You'll put that guy, then Kendrick, then Drake. You see what I'm saying? [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5461.78s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. And then after another generation goes, [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5464.78s)]
*  you're not even talking about Kendrick and Drake. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5467.78s)]
*  So I think it's just you become, you wear the belt within your generation, [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5469.78s)]
*  and then you just have to accept, like, it's going to move on. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5474.78s)]
*  None of these young kids consider Jay-Z to be the greatest rapper alive. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5477.78s)]
*  Our generation, there are very few people that don't think that he was wearing the belt. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5480.78s)]
*  He was number one. So it's a kind of silly endeavor to chase for your life, [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5484.78s)]
*  because it will never exist. It's like being the greatest empire of all time. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5489.78s)]
*  Oh, was Rome the greatest empire? I don't fucking know. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5494.78s)]
*  Seems like America is. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5496.78s)]
*  Louis said a thing when he came on this pod. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5498.78s)]
*  He was like, the top of the mountain is not a place you're supposed to stay. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5500.78s)]
*  It's a place you go visit and then you get the fuck down. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5503.78s)]
*  I think he would say he'd probably try to stay up there too long. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5505.78s)]
*  But you go up there, you're like, hey, I got here. Now let's get back down. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5508.78s)]
*  You're not setting up a home. It's not your choice. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5511.78s)]
*  Yeah. Get comfortable with that idea, because you're not... [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5513.78s)]
*  People, you'll be there temporarily. If you got there, that's it. That's all you can do. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5516.78s)]
*  And then some people can go twice. Some people may even be able to go three times. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5519.78s)]
*  There are different people that have these different stages in their career where they kill it, things are OK. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5523.78s)]
*  They have this resurgence. That happens sometimes. It rarely happens, but it sometimes happens. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5530.78s)]
*  But whether this generation... I think maybe we remember this and we go, OK, yeah, it was Kendrick. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5536.78s)]
*  He was the best. But I don't think that we'll listen to Kendrick's music more now because of that. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5543.78s)]
*  Oh, you know... [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5549.78s)]
*  Yeah, short term we will. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5551.78s)]
*  But you guys make a good point. Moving forward, what is the step forward? [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5552.78s)]
*  I think you got to take the summer off, bro. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5556.78s)]
*  I think there are more products coming. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5558.78s)]
*  Yeah, he's just not. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5560.78s)]
*  I think he's doing like a... [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5561.78s)]
*  Ak just tweeted something about how he's got some more heat on the way. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5562.78s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5564.78s)]
*  Yeah, dude. Here's what I'll also say. After the push thing, I remember we had just started Flaygr and I came on as a guy who didn't like Drake. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5567.78s)]
*  And I was like, you know what? I know Drake. This is going to last like a month and he's going to be fine. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5573.78s)]
*  But it's cool to see him take an L because he had never taken an L. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5577.78s)]
*  I don't feel the same certainty that everything will be the exact same, if not better, very quickly. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5581.78s)]
*  I think I don't know if it's ever going to be quite the same. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5586.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5589.78s)]
*  He'll still be great. Drake is a pop star. He's going to make money. He makes fucking great music. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5590.78s)]
*  Even me as somebody who says I hate him, like I never would deny that. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5595.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5598.78s)]
*  But I do think largely the thing that he might have wanted, which is goat status, that might be out of reach now. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5599.78s)]
*  We might look at that and be like, no, you're wanting to in battles. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5605.78s)]
*  The other guy that we had you compared to, actually, there's two guys we had you compared to. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5609.78s)]
*  And one of them made one quit before it even started. And then he made us look at you differently forever. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5613.78s)]
*  It is an interesting, like it's a, you can look at it from both directions. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5618.78s)]
*  You can look at it as a great lesson for if you're following Drake's side, a great lesson, which is like chase your art and create the projects you want to create. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5623.78s)]
*  But creating for approval, if you will, like creating just to have the top spot will often put you in a place that is inauthentic. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5634.78s)]
*  And that might cause you it costs you everything. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5644.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5646.78s)]
*  And then you can look at the exact same thing from Kendrick's side and you can go, oh, he said I want the spot and he took it and he reaped all the all the rewards for it. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5647.78s)]
*  It is a gamble. It's a huge fucking game. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5656.78s)]
*  They could have subbed each other for the next 10 fucking years and it would have just been left up to the fans to decide. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5661.78s)]
*  And they went at it and they had a boxing match. And now it's not left up to the fans. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5669.78s)]
*  Yeah. Now it's left up to the history books. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5674.78s)]
*  I do wonder if I'm projecting some of my own feelings on Kendrick. I think I like, you know, I think about Indian American culture, what it is a lot. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5676.78s)]
*  I think Kendrick feels that way about hip hop culture, black culture, and he wants it to go a certain way. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5683.78s)]
*  And I think he I think he didn't like the direction it was going with Drake at the helm. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5689.78s)]
*  And he was like, we're ending that now. It's not even about the spot. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5693.78s)]
*  It's about taking my culture in a direction I want to take it into. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5696.78s)]
*  So it looks like he's got a dance album or a dance project coming up, like at least just like house music, EDM music with kind of music. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5702.78s)]
*  With who? [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5709.78s)]
*  Kind of music. It's who he did. Honestly, never mind. Yeah, honestly, never mind with with the kind music, kind of music, which is not music. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5710.78s)]
*  How do you spell it? K-E-I-N-E-M-U-S-I-K. Is that different than kind music? [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5718.78s)]
*  Well, it looks like the same word, but kind of means not in German. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5724.78s)]
*  Is that the same person that people were going to see Friday night? [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5729.78s)]
*  Correct. So they did. You know that Drake video where you see him like at the club in like the south of France or somewhere with like Rampa and me and you out in Port? [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5733.78s)]
*  Is that one of his considered classic albums? Honestly, never mind. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5742.78s)]
*  No, but it was cool that he does something like that. He did it with like Gordo. It goes global though. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5745.78s)]
*  Yeah. He saw that this is what people are fucking with and he did it. I like Drake for that. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5750.78s)]
*  I truly didn't know. No, no. Because I know he's got classics. People say he's got multiple classics. I didn't know that was one of them. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5754.78s)]
*  I'm surprised he's going that route because people didn't like it. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5760.78s)]
*  But isn't that the isn't let's make the argument for why he would do it. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5765.78s)]
*  If I do my rapity rap shit. All people are going to do is compare it to Kendrick right now. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5770.78s)]
*  If I go in a different genre and I go to some other black music, they don't call me the colonizer. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5776.78s)]
*  They're going to say that I'm leeching or using these people for approval. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5785.78s)]
*  Okay, true. If I go completely different direction, I dance music or house music, whatever, I'm immediately the coolest person in dance music. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5788.78s)]
*  Like there's no one in dance music that is cooler than Drake. I mean, except for David Guetta. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5798.78s)]
*  Shout out to his family. But like he's immediately the coolest, right? Yeah. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5805.78s)]
*  So let me go to the place where I'm most celebrated. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5810.78s)]
*  Not where I'm tolerated. Maybe get some hits going. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5813.78s)]
*  Maybe win over the summer on some dance tracks. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5816.78s)]
*  Now we're talking about that. And especially we're talking about amongst a group of people that don't really care as much about rap beef. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5819.78s)]
*  If you out in Mykonos partying and you some European motherfucker that don't even understand half the words that Kendrick said, you're just saying the N word to speed or whatever. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5826.78s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5834.78s)]
*  Shout out, Pauline. And it's like, if you're doing that, he might be able to get some buzz, create still music, be cool amongst a group of people that don't really care as much about this beef. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5836.78s)]
*  Yeah, this channel is wide open. Like to your point, the channel is, this channel is fun. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5850.78s)]
*  And then if it works. And if the last project was subpar, it could only go up. Up from here. Yeah, actually. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5855.78s)]
*  And if it works, you at least maintain your buzz. You don't win this battle, but you maintain your buzz and you got people talking, you got people dancing, and they're connecting the times they're going to have this summer where they're going to be mollied out, they're going to be coked out, they're going to be partying and listening to Drake and all those good vibes that you're feeling while you're listening to stuff. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5862.78s)]
*  It's hard not to connect those two things. And now we go into the fall. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5881.78s)]
*  And yeah, we remembered that fucking rough patch and all this weird shit. Also, you're doing songs in countries where the age limit is like 16. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5887.78s)]
*  They don't even know what a minor is. So they're not even making sense. Vats is a minor. Vats is a minor. I don't understand Vats is a minor. Vats 16 is a problem. The pretty girl's woman is 16 years old. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5898.78s)]
*  So it's kind of the perfect... This is so overblown. This is blown out of proportion. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5911.78s)]
*  He might have solved this problem perfectly. But the shit got to go. He need a couple bops off of this one. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5920.78s)]
*  So here's part of the track. Do you want to hear? Yeah. I think this is a leak. I haven't heard of it. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5927.78s)]
*  This is an unfair... This is an unfair listen. This is an unfair listen. Why? Because it's being knighted by Molly that's still in my head? [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5932.78s)]
*  That is the thing about this music. And I'm sure people who like you listen to it, you can hear the difference. All this shit sounds the same. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5943.78s)]
*  It's that build up and then the beat drops. They're pulling from right now. It's Afrobeatz. And now they're mixing... DJs mixing all of these Ethiopian... [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5951.78s)]
*  All Afrobeatz don't sound the same. That wasn't Afrobeatz. That wasn't Afrobeatz. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5961.78s)]
*  All of that plus Drake. It's kind of dope. I don't get how a DJ creates buzz doing that. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5967.78s)]
*  Welcome to being old, Doug. Welcome to being fucking nuts. It's a different style of music. It's not ours anymore. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5976.78s)]
*  That's like white people back in the day going, yo, all rap sounds the same. Yeah, literally. This is what white people said about rap. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5982.78s)]
*  Welcome, Doug. Welcome. What are they, just rap about guns and killing each other? [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5988.78s)]
*  Damn, bro. You go to the Hamptons one weekend and come back like... [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=5993.78s)]
*  So I think it could be strategically... I think it's a smart move. I think you get away from the Rappity Rap shit right now. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6001.78s)]
*  Because even if you are doing rap and you try and talk, what are you going to rap about when you're rapping on the Rappity Rap shit? [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6008.78s)]
*  I'm the best. I'm the nicest. I get all the bitches. I got all the money. And every reaction to that is going to be like, you second nicest. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6013.78s)]
*  Yeah. You second nicest. Yeah, maybe you get the bitches, but maybe the future gets more bitches. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6021.78s)]
*  They might be young. They might be young. They might be your homies, bitches. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6028.78s)]
*  We want to hear about love. We want to hear about embracing. We want to hear about sunshine. We want to hear about sandy beaches. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6032.78s)]
*  Yeah. I think it's a smart move. I'm curious if it was even a move or it was just something in the pipeline that he has to go through. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6041.78s)]
*  I wonder if he did this like four or five months ago. I would think Pivot. He's not a dumb guy. I think this is a Pivot. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6049.78s)]
*  He's an incredibly savvy. But what's he going to do this whole time? He's going to be cooking up an album? [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6054.78s)]
*  I don't know when this was recorded. That's the thing. What I'm saying is I think you're right. They've been working on this for a minute. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6059.78s)]
*  Maybe they bumped it up, but you think you would want to hear for summer. Yeah. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6066.78s)]
*  But him just cooking up a whole album with this kind of music guy immediately during the beat just seems... [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6070.78s)]
*  And I don't know if it's a whole album or if it's just like a specific song or a couple songs or something. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6076.78s)]
*  I don't think that shit takes that long to make. You might be right. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6080.78s)]
*  These motherfuckers be putting together songs on the spot and if shit sound fine. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6084.78s)]
*  Not like that. Two months ago. So he's had time. He's had at least eight weeks to just cook shit up. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6088.78s)]
*  You let that shit run for the summer. You're not going to beat that. When that shit comes on, it is a vibe. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6093.78s)]
*  It's over. Yeah. That shit is a vibe. They got the remixes coming still probably. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6097.78s)]
*  You know, also here's the thing that we need to discuss a little bit. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6102.78s)]
*  If you're a DJ, I don't need you having no fucking loyalty to a record label or none. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6106.78s)]
*  You won't fuck the night up with that shit. Yeah. Stop it with it. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6114.78s)]
*  If you're a DJ, you are a neutral party. Switzerland. Exactly. You got a loyalty to the audience. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6117.78s)]
*  You have a loyalty to us. Yes. If you're a DJ associated with one label and you're only playing their shit at the party, it gets a little exhausting. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6123.78s)]
*  We need you to be able to diversify. You got to play shit from the ops. You got to play shit from the people you're with. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6131.78s)]
*  But that label hired them. Say again. If that label hired them and they know where their biggest checks is coming to. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6137.78s)]
*  Hey, you do what you got to do. Don't fuck up your bag. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6143.78s)]
*  Yo, party planners, stop hiring DJs that have loyalty to just one record label because it's going to make the party worse. Objectively worse. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6146.78s)]
*  DJ Mustard might be the best producer in the world right now. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6155.78s)]
*  I wouldn't want to go to a party because he might be like, man, I can't play no fucking East Coast music or Drake or nothing. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6159.78s)]
*  Everybody at West Coast, a whole three hours. It's going to be a whole. Yeah. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6164.78s)]
*  Otherwise I'm going to look like a sellout or people are going to make videos of me playing a Drake song. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6167.78s)]
*  I don't want you to have to think about. I want you unencumbered with these thoughts. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6171.78s)]
*  Only person could do it is Metro Boomin, the most talented musician on the planet. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6174.78s)]
*  He's the only person that could play just his hits and it will be worth it. In my opinion. He's got banners. Yeah. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6178.78s)]
*  Yeah, you're not wrong. Have you heard Andrew Schaltz go? Yeah. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6185.78s)]
*  What did I do? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6192.78s)]
*  Now, do you know what I'm saying about the. Yeah, of course. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6198.78s)]
*  I hear what you say. You can't have loyalty to the DJ. I need you to be loyal to us and what we want to do. The vibe. You're loyal to the vibe. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6201.78s)]
*  We were at one party this weekend and it was just one fucking label there playing the whole time. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6208.78s)]
*  It wasn't even like a Drake Kendrick beef. It wasn't even that. It had nothing even do with it. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6212.78s)]
*  But it was so obvious that it was just one label that they're playing. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6218.78s)]
*  And it was you felt it, right? Yeah. I'm looking at I'm going, what the fuck is going on? [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6222.78s)]
*  And Al said to me, he was like, no, he got to play this. Look, he's he's part of them or something like that. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6227.78s)]
*  And the next song, same three fucking artists. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6232.78s)]
*  So when a comic has a political agenda, it's like, oh, I know where you're going. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6235.78s)]
*  Yeah, you get every joke is liberal. Every joke is conservative. You like fucking I roll. Yeah. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6239.78s)]
*  Yeah, we should DJ. They should put us in charge. We were trying, bro. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6245.78s)]
*  We were trying. He closed out the party. I didn't do it. I didn't. I was showing the song. He was getting tight. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6250.78s)]
*  I was showing the song to y'all. I suggested one. He was like, I played that one already, but I'll play it again. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6255.78s)]
*  That shit is disrespectful. I do feel bad doing that, but I feel worse listening to the same fucking songs. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6260.78s)]
*  So I had to step in there. Yeah. It was for the sake of the party. Yeah. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6267.78s)]
*  And the music was too loud to so loud. So I put my earplugs in. Oh, God. I was bugging out, dude. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6271.78s)]
*  You can't I don't want to have a hearing damage because I'm standing near a speaker. Did you really put your earplugs in? Yeah. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6277.78s)]
*  So gay. He took a napkins and then he shoves it. He is right. I mean, my ears are ringing. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6282.78s)]
*  Your ears are still ringing, bro. It's just that Brazilian girl screaming. No. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6287.78s)]
*  Well, that's your earplugs, right? Your honor. I had napkins deep in my canal. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6291.78s)]
*  OK, listen, we got to do some Patrioni. Come join us on Patreon. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6299.78s)]
*  We'll tell you all about Dove's Brazilian night out. The actual night in, if you will. And we'll see you there. We love y'all. Peace. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwAVPNyLo1I&t=6304.78s)]
