*  What's up, everybody? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=0.0s)]
*  What? [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1.24s)]
*  What? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2.04s)]
*  What? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2.92s)]
*  Welcome to the show. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3.72s)]
*  Today we are joined by good friends, Netflix superstars. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5.88s)]
*  Yeah, Steve Gerby. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=9.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=11.08s)]
*  Steve Gerby and also Shane Giles, of course. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=11.88s)]
*  But Steve Gerby, I think the world has known, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=14.0s)]
*  has just hit a sub-80. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=15.84s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=17.48s)]
*  Round on a golf course right now. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=18.28s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=20.2s)]
*  And I'm not saying that, like, the acting superstar [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=21.0s)]
*  has gone to his head. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=23.92s)]
*  But the sub-80, I think, might have changed something. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=24.72s)]
*  I mean, he asked Alex to not be on the couch [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=27.36s)]
*  because of the color of his skin. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=29.8s)]
*  That is true. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=31.2s)]
*  I did walk up to him on set just to say hi [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  and try to give him a hug. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  And he was like, not right now, Schultz. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=34.84s)]
*  And then he just walked away. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=36.24s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=37.24s)]
*  Not even close. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=38.16s)]
*  Because he didn't like the way I was talking to you. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=39.04s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=41.24s)]
*  He didn't like that I was being nice to you. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=42.04s)]
*  That was actually really funny. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=44.16s)]
*  You didn't tell this. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=45.44s)]
*  Suck up. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=46.24s)]
*  I'm not a suck up. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  He's talking. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=48.28s)]
*  Andrew's coming down. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=48.92s)]
*  You basically donated his time. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=49.84s)]
*  So I'm just like, you know, talking to him [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=51.28s)]
*  and keeping the energy up. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=53.2s)]
*  And he's like, you want to fucking be on Flay Grim. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=54.24s)]
*  I'm like, shit. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=56.68s)]
*  I'm just talking to him. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=58.48s)]
*  He didn't even say that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=60.959999999999994s)]
*  It just walks up. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=62.44s)]
*  I didn't say you want to be on Flay Grim. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=63.44s)]
*  For whatever reason. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=65.44s)]
*  It's all the time. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=66.44s)]
*  What does it say? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=67.44s)]
*  He just walks up. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=68.44s)]
*  He's kind of hulking. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=69.44s)]
*  He goes, stop it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=70.44s)]
*  It just walks away. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=71.44s)]
*  You should have seen him with Thomas Hayden Church [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=73.44s)]
*  on this season. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=75.72s)]
*  Just like agreeable. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=77.44s)]
*  You know, I would say that's the way that I would describe it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=79.08s)]
*  And so you just kind of use social grease and what have you. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  You say, you know, you just kind of go along with it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  And he just doesn't like it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=86.8s)]
*  I don't know what you're talking about. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=87.96s)]
*  So how are you doing, Andy? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=89.55999999999999s)]
*  I did this with Zlatan Ibrahimovic. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=93.52s)]
*  We met him in Abu Dhabi. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  He's a soccer player, all time legend, one of the greats. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=98.72s)]
*  And I just saw him. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=101.55999999999999s)]
*  And it was like one of the few times I like spazzed out [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=102.91999999999999s)]
*  seeing a famous person. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=104.83999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=105.88s)]
*  Like normally I just avoid it and it just goes away. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=106.67999999999999s)]
*  But I just couldn't help it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=108.8s)]
*  I was like, I have to get a picture with Zlatan. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=110.0s)]
*  So I dapped him up and I was like, dude, I love you. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=111.8s)]
*  I think I said I love him to Zlatan. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  And he was like, OK. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=116.24s)]
*  And then I took a selfie and then I never saw him again. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=117.56s)]
*  He just walked away. It was awful. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=119.32s)]
*  It was terrible. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=121.0s)]
*  Hey, you got a selfie. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=121.6s)]
*  I was starstruck. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  Caitlin Clark was at my show in Indiana. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=124.6s)]
*  And I had for some reason I was like, oh, shit. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=127.92s)]
*  Every once in a while somebody gets me that I didn't think [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=132.64s)]
*  was going to make it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=134.72s)]
*  Holy fuck. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=136.0s)]
*  Of you saying hi to Steph Curry and introducing yourself [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=136.76s)]
*  and him going, I know who you are. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=139.72s)]
*  Yeah, that was awesome. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=141.0s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=141.72s)]
*  I mean, that's fucking awesome. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=142.64s)]
*  Which was funny too, because it was me and Sam Jay. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=143.6s)]
*  We went to a Knicks game. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=146.6s)]
*  And the whole time I'm like sitting there, I'm like, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=148.20000000000002s)]

*  Fuck these motherfuckers. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  Draymond Green's a cocksucker. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  Fuck him. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=155.36s)]
*  But our seat was right next to the bench and Draymond [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  was sitting next to us. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=158.4s)]
*  And he was funny as fuck. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=160.44s)]
*  And he was the fucking man. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  And I was like, damn, I was wrong about Draymond. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=162.68s)]
*  And then I'm like, fuck, Steph Curry is a fucking bitch. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=164.72s)]
*  Dude, fuck Steph Curry. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=166.8s)]
*  And then he looks over at Sam Jay because he knew Sam. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=168.24s)]
*  And he was like, what's up? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=170.24s)]
*  And immediately she and I were both like, dude, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=171.24s)]
*  Steph Curry is the fucking boss. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=172.88s)]
*  He's so awesome. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=175.23999999999998s)]
*  Even just as a fan, I rooted for him one time in the Olympics. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=177.44s)]
*  And I was like, oh, I get why Golden State fans are the worst. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=180.12s)]
*  It's the most fun you can ever have. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=183.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=184.95999999999998s)]
*  That was back when I liked the Knicks. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=186.28s)]
*  That was last season. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=188.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=189.92s)]
*  Why don't you like the Knicks? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=190.39999999999998s)]
*  Last year when they eliminated Philly. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=191.72s)]
*  You guys were in the playoffs last year? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=194.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=196.2s)]

*  and acted like you won the Super Bowl? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=200.0s)]
*  You won one series. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=202.12s)]
*  Every single game. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=203.12s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=204.32s)]
*  I was trying to cheer for you guys. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=205.79999999999998s)]
*  You're such cocksuckers. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=207.16s)]
*  Somebody else said that too. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  It is tough, dude. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  I want to. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=210.2s)]

*  It was brutal. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=212.56s)]
*  We went to Indianapolis last night to watch the game [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=213.32s)]

*  I don't know if he had even seen it yet. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=672.84s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=674.5200000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=675.5200000000001s)]
*  But he just instantly was like, yeah, just say when. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=676.5200000000001s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=678.12s)]
*  And then we were trying to find a way to get him in the show. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=679.12s)]
*  Of course. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=682.44s)]
*  We got Vince. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=683.44s)]
*  Of course. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=684.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=685.44s)]
*  And then we kind of shoehorn him in there. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=686.44s)]
*  So you'll see. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=688.44s)]
*  He's in like two scenes. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=689.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=690.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=691.44s)]
*  So you're writing for Vince Vaughn, right? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=692.44s)]
*  And you've seen every Vince Vaughn movie, right? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=694.0400000000001s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=695.8800000000001s)]

*  Yes. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=697.8800000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=698.8800000000001s)]
*  How do you stop yourself from just writing? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=699.8800000000001s)]
*  We didn't. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=701.6400000000001s)]
*  He wrote his, he had a pass at the script and do you remember that? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=702.6400000000001s)]
*  Every sentence ended with baby. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=710.1600000000001s)]
*  Oh. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=711.6400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=712.6400000000001s)]
*  I mean, the times, baby. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=713.6400000000001s)]
*  Look at these times, baby. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=714.6400000000001s)]
*  Come on, baby. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=715.6400000000001s)]
*  Come on. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=716.84s)]
*  So you get Vince in and then he's in these scenes and you've obviously worked the script [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=717.84s)]
*  to like respect him as an actor and not make him. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=723.72s)]
*  He got the lines like right away. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=727.0s)]
*  I mean, I think we gave him to him that day. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=728.84s)]
*  And he just knew him. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=731.56s)]
*  It was pretty impressive. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=733.02s)]
*  And then he added Vince stuff, which it was awesome to watch. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=734.02s)]
*  Were you intimidated like when you're? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=739.4s)]
*  A little, yeah. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=741.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=742.56s)]
*  Especially because our scene is just me and him sitting at the bar, right? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=743.76s)]
*  And it's like, oh shit. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=746.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=747.8399999999999s)]
*  And he would like improv and say just, I don't know, we'd finish the scene and be like, what [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=748.8399999999999s)]

*  I don't know. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=759.16s)]
*  He's not at all intimidated like doing comedy with you. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=760.16s)]
*  No. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=766.16s)]
*  It's interesting, right? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=767.16s)]

*  confident in his shit. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=778.08s)]

*  No, I don't know. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=899.96s)]
