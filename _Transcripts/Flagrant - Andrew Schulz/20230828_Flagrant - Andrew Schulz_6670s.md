*  Whoa. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=567.76s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1047.0400000000002s)]
*  I think that. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1047.5200000000002s)]
*  I don't think that. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1048.24s)]
*  And it did hurt you a little bit when he was like, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1048.88s)]
*  after I rewatched the fight, I didn't think you won. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1050.72s)]

*  You won that fucking fight. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1058.24s)]
*  And then all of a sudden he's like, you fucking lost, pussy. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1059.68s)]
*  But not all of a sudden. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1062.48s)]
*  A few things happen in between. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1064.64s)]

*  I fucking love him. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1073.76s)]
*  We decided after we both went public with our little disagreements. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1074.8s)]
*  No more public shit. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1079.6s)]
*  Nah, it's so stupid. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1080.48s)]
*  Good. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1081.52s)]

*  I got his support. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1084.56s)]
*  Why don't you cut it out in the moment? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1084.72s)]
*  Like when you guys are afterwards, like, yo, maybe you should just trim it from the pod. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1086.72s)]
*  We did. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1089.6000000000001s)]
*  It was a conversation. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1089.92s)]
*  Here's the honest answer. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1091.04s)]

*  And this is why I said we, I can't believe we haven't learned from our mistakes [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1094.48s)]
*  because it's happened before. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1097.3600000000001s)]
*  We just get caught up, bro. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1098.96s)]
*  And like the ego, like, no, I don't care. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1100.0800000000002s)]
*  You shoot a pod. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1101.8400000000001s)]
*  You're doing the next thing. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1102.72s)]
*  I landed from a flight from London three hours ago. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1103.68s)]

*  And you often don't think about the repercussions if you're moving so fast. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1111.04s)]
*  You just don't. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1114.64s)]

*  Right. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1124.32s)]

*  It's a turkey. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1250.0s)]
*  It's a turkey but the gas car. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1250.8s)]
*  Nina's face? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1252.08s)]

*  Who was in here? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1256.56s)]

*  You didn't say no. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1265.04s)]
*  No, so now I'm reconsidering because we had a face to face. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1266.0s)]
*  I told you this. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1270.0s)]
*  We sat down at a table, me and Dylan, for 30 minutes. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1270.56s)]
*  No third party conversation happening, just me and him talking. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1275.52s)]
*  And in it, he was asked about that photo. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1281.2s)]
*  And I was like, bro, you know what I think? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1284.96s)]
*  I think you're a fucking liar. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1288.72s)]
*  Not just with this, with everything. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1290.16s)]
*  Dylan's a liar. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1291.44s)]
*  He lies about everything. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1292.24s)]
*  He's a troll. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1293.1200000000001s)]
*  That's what we do, right? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1293.68s)]
*  You say shit to try to trigger people. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1294.4s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1296.48s)]
*  But he lies. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1297.68s)]
*  And so I was like, you're saying you have this photo. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1298.3200000000002s)]
*  Why don't you post it? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1301.44s)]
*  Post the fucking photo, bro. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1304.0800000000002s)]
*  It's like, I fucking have a photo, bro. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1305.6000000000001s)]
*  And I said, no, you don't. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1307.6000000000001s)]
*  I called his bluff. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1309.0400000000002s)]
*  I said, no, you don't. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1309.68s)]
*  And even if you did, even if he did have some grotesque deranged explicit photo, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1310.64s)]
*  this dude was dumb enough to fucking tweet about having the photo and transferring it [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1317.68s)]
*  already, which is a crime in itself. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1322.48s)]
*  If he's saying he's gonna go to jail for it, he's already committed a crime by [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1324.64s)]
*  transferring this explicit likely non-consensual image to his peers. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1328.64s)]
*  That's already illegal. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1333.52s)]
*  So if he were to leak it or have someone else leak it, it can always be traced. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1335.1200000000001s)]
*  He didn't send it to me, I asked, though. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1339.1200000000001s)]
*  Come on, bro. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1341.2s)]
*  I didn't ask for the photo. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1341.6000000000001s)]
*  I was like, what is it about? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1342.56s)]
*  What is it? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1343.76s)]
*  Come on, bro. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1344.16s)]
*  And he goes, Logan's your boy. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1344.56s)]
*  I can't send it to you. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1346.8799999999999s)]
*  And I was like, well, yes, but just tell me. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1348.1599999999999s)]
*  I don't want the photo. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1351.36s)]
*  I just want to know what it's about. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1352.3999999999999s)]
*  He knew better. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1353.76s)]
*  Do you have an idea of what it is? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1354.3999999999999s)]
*  I don't think he has a photo. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1356.08s)]
*  Now, did you have a conversation with Nina where you're like, yo, talk to us. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1358.56s)]
*  100%. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1361.84s)]
*  And what did she say? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1363.28s)]
*  I said, do you have any idea what he's talking about? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1364.0s)]
*  She says, no. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1367.04s)]
*  She said, I legitimately, bottom of my heart, have no fucking clue what he's talking about. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1368.72s)]
*  If he has something, it's something that I don't know about. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1373.6s)]
*  Non-consensual. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1377.4399999999998s)]
*  Mm. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1378.3999999999999s)]
*  Did you guys have to have tough combos because of this or you already went through your past? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1378.8799999999999s)]

*  I'll tell you what, Mr. Moneybags. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1714.16s)]
*  I'm going to make this more interesting for you. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1717.12s)]
*  How about we double it? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1718.6399999999999s)]
*  Two million. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1721.68s)]
*  Two million dollars says I beat your boy, Dylan Danis. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1723.12s)]
*  I know you're going to see this. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1725.36s)]
*  I know you're going to see this clip. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1726.8s)]
*  You're coaching him. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1728.96s)]
*  You're guiding him. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1730.24s)]
*  He's definitely going to show up, right? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1731.36s)]
*  Fuck you. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1733.04s)]
*  Both of you are all bark, no bite. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1734.24s)]
*  Two million dollars that says I beat your boy. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1736.8799999999999s)]
*  I will send you the contract tomorrow. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1738.56s)]
*  But he's not going to respond. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1740.6399999999999s)]
*  All bark, no bite, both of them. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1742.3999999999999s)]
*  That was crazy how you gave him an Australian accent, bro. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1744.24s)]
*  I don't think. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1746.72s)]
*  I thought that was a joke. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1747.22s)]
*  That was pretty good. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1749.84s)]
*  Hey, Conor, take that. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1751.28s)]
*  That was good. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1753.6s)]
*  You hate it. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1754.08s)]
*  Listen, listen. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1754.56s)]
*  Listen, get it. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1756.0s)]
*  Okay, Conor. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1756.6399999999999s)]
*  He knows. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1757.76s)]
*  He knows. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1758.48s)]
*  Objectively, the greatest promoter in fight sport history? [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1759.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1763.12s)]
*  He's incredible. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1763.9199999999998s)]
*  Objectively. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1764.8799999999999s)]
*  He's incredible. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1765.4399999999998s)]
*  Why would he not take two million dollars? [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1767.28s)]
*  Because he knows the outcome. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1769.28s)]
*  You think that he's confident that you beat? [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1771.04s)]
*  Why would anyone think that Dylan Danis could beat me? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1775.1999999999998s)]
*  Don't do that. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1778.6399999999999s)]
*  Why? [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1779.84s)]
*  No one sees him in Bellator and is like, that dude could strike. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1785.04s)]
*  He won by a toe hold in one of his wins. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1790.08s)]
*  How does that work? [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1794.32s)]
*  You just hold the toe and he knows how that works. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1794.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I like feet. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1797.12s)]
*  He loves a toe hold. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1797.84s)]
*  I knew that about you. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1798.72s)]
*  You told me about your feet thing. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1800.8799999999999s)]
*  My feet. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1802.6399999999999s)]
*  My feet. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1804.9599999999998s)]
*  How do you feel about your feet? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1805.4399999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1808.0s)]
*  Do you feel, do you think he's going to show up? [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1810.48s)]
*  He has to show up. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1815.12s)]
*  You know what? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1815.9199999999998s)]
*  I don't know because again, I keep referencing this face to face. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1816.24s)]
*  I need this fucking thing to come out because that's when you can see the true Dylan Danis. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1818.72s)]
*  That's when you can see the person behind the tweets and he's just a melty, empty puddle of a man. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1822.3999999999999s)]
*  What's the clause if he doesn't show? [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1830.32s)]
*  This is the issue. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1832.72s)]
*  If he doesn't show and he essentially tries to fake an injury, we get to choose the doctor, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1833.6s)]
*  by the way, to confirm said injury so we can't fake a shit. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1838.24s)]
*  What if he has pre-existing injury? [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1841.92s)]
*  No, it doesn't matter. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1844.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1846.4s)]
*  You didn't think about that. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1848.4s)]
*  We didn't think about it a lot here. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1849.68s)]
*  We're getting played. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1854.08s)]
*  We're getting fucking doomed. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1856.48s)]
*  I'll be honest. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1857.6s)]
*  I thought this was an easy W. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1861.1200000000001s)]
*  Nah, because here's what's going to happen. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1864.0s)]
*  If he pulls out, he owes us 100K, but that's nothing compared to all this attention he got. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1866.08s)]
*  Anybody would pay $100,000 to be the focal point of the fight game. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1873.84s)]
*  Come on, bro. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1879.04s)]
*  He's gained fucking half a million followers. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1879.76s)]
*  Be honest. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1884.4s)]
*  Good for him for capitalizing. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1885.28s)]
*  Some people don't take that opportunity. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1886.56s)]
*  He capitalized. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1887.76s)]
*  But if he does back out, where do you go as a man? [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1888.72s)]
*  How do you go anywhere in life without being fucking ridiculed for being the biggest pussy [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1892.64s)]
*  and liar in the world? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1896.88s)]
*  He has to show up. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1898.64s)]
*  Are those half a million followers worth being clown for the rest of your fucking life? [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1900.88s)]
*  He's been trolling and hasn't fought in a really long time. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1905.0400000000002s)]
*  He hasn't fought in 1,532 days. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1908.88s)]
*  And I know that because right now on dildodanis.com, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1912.4s)]
*  there's a running counter on how long it's been since Dylan Last fought. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1916.72s)]
*  And it's been 1,530 plus days. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1920.8s)]
*  If he does fight, okay, I'm gonna throw something at you right now. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1924.16s)]
*  And you know where we're going with this. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1928.08s)]
*  If he does fight, if he does beat you, Milton, I swear, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1929.52s)]
*  can somebody get Milton a quarter water and a chicken? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1941.28s)]
*  If he does beat you, have you thought about what you do? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1943.36s)]
*  Probably enjoy being a billionaire married to a supermodel and become WWE champion, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1953.6799999999998s)]
*  run a podcast that's number one in the world, sign athletes to prime repeatedly, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1961.84s)]
*  go live on a farm, smile every single day of my life, have kids or the family be happy forever. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1966.8799999999999s)]
*  Come on, bro. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1972.48s)]
*  Good light, good light. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1973.4399999999998s)]
*  Beautiful. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1977.9199999999998s)]
*  Concerned about that, but you went for it. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1978.1599999999999s)]
*  I thought it was the right decision. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1979.9199999999998s)]
*  So you feel like there's nothing for you to lose. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1982.0s)]
*  Which no, no, no. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1984.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, it would obviously be highly embarrassing. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1987.04s)]
*  Are you trying to have kids? [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1989.04s)]
*  She pulled the goalie? [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=1990.8s)]

*  I know, I know. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2024.0s)]
*  And she was kind of like, the producers would be like, yo, this girl is actually funny [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2024.7199999999998s)]
*  because you never think the model is going to be funny. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2028.56s)]
*  No, that, okay. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2030.32s)]
*  So Nina is. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2031.04s)]
*  Because we had dumb models on there. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2032.24s)]

*  They don't have to crash. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2492.96s)]
*  I mean, maybe they ran out of alien gas. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2494.0s)]
*  That's most likely. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2496.72s)]
*  That's possible. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2497.36s)]

*  It was stationary for a moment, then it was moving fast, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2610.96s)]
*  basically bilocating to a different place. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2613.2799999999997s)]
*  What I'm saying is, besides hyper advanced, as far as human technology goes, [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2615.2799999999997s)]

*  That's all. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2629.12s)]
*  Yeah, they'd have to be cruising. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2629.52s)]
*  It's more likely than you think that you wouldn't capture it on camera. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2630.8s)]
*  Yeah, and imagine, in order to get here, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2634.0s)]
*  you have to be able to travel close to the speed of light. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2636.0s)]
*  So if you can travel close to the speed of light. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2638.72s)]
*  But even then, Andrew, it would take so fucking long [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2640.64s)]
*  to get here from another planet. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2642.8s)]
*  Imagine that a hundred light years away. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2643.92s)]
*  You're traveling at the speed of light. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2645.28s)]

*  Okay. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2677.04s)]
*  Huh? [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2677.52s)]

*  Go. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2683.92s)]
*  Uh, because there is no matter in space, there's no molecules, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2685.06s)]
*  the sun rays are essentially nonexistent. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2690.26s)]

*  Not ride on them. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2710.82s)]

*  He's like, the wind is the rays. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2714.82s)]

*  Maybe you could say it. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2824.66s)]
*  Gatorade, Gatorade. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2825.14s)]

*  I don't know if I'm allowed to say, so I'm just going to assume. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2846.98s)]
*  So one of the companies cannot buy you? [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2849.38s)]
*  It would be considered a monopoly. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2851.14s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2853.14s)]
*  Both not buy you? [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2855.54s)]
*  Or only one of the two? [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2857.06s)]
*  As far as I know, the one is not able to buy us. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2859.14s)]
*  So they're still? [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2862.26s)]
*  We got, bro, we're taking market share. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2864.1s)]
*  Not me trying to flex that we're eating fucking market share [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2867.22s)]
*  and taking dollars out of these massive corporate conglomerate's pockets. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2870.98s)]
*  So for everybody who's watching, what usually happens in a situation like this [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2874.66s)]
*  is a giant billion dollar corporation sees some competition coming up. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2877.62s)]
*  This happens in tech. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2882.5s)]
*  It happens in retail. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2883.38s)]
*  It happens in everything. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2884.26s)]
*  And they go, hey, this is about to reach escape velocity. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2885.14s)]
*  Well, they'll be a competitor. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2888.34s)]
*  We have to buy them before that happens. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2889.54s)]
*  Is that a pretty fair way to describe the scenario? [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2892.1000000000004s)]
*  Or shut them down before it happens. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2895.7000000000003s)]
*  It's cheaper to shut them down than it is to have to buy them later. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2898.02s)]
*  Because bro, we're like, we're innovative. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2904.58s)]
*  We're edgy. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2907.2200000000003s)]
*  We're bold. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2907.94s)]
*  But also, let's just back up for a second. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2908.82s)]
*  The fact that they're coming at you for a beverage being unhealthy or whatever it is. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2910.42s)]
*  I know that Coca-Cola doesn't want people looking into Coca-Cola. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2918.34s)]
*  Don't get me started on Aspartame. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2925.1400000000003s)]
*  Don't get me started on the sugar content. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2927.1400000000003s)]
*  But that's what made me start looking at it and go, wait a minute. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2929.1400000000003s)]
*  Is this the let's destroy the brand campaign before we have to buy it? [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2931.54s)]
*  What are we doing? [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2935.38s)]
*  What are we doing? [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2936.98s)]
*  Wait, the only thing I'm confused, why do you think they want to shut you down? [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2937.94s)]
*  I think they just want to drive down the price so then they can buy you at a cheaper. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2940.58s)]
*  Well, if it gets so low, they don't have to buy it at all. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2945.2200000000003s)]
*  Because people will just buy their stuff. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2948.18s)]
*  They want to not buy it. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2950.18s)]
*  Because buying it is going to cost billions. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2951.46s)]
*  What's cheaper, acquisition or the campaign to destroy? [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2953.7s)]
*  Right now, they're at a place where I don't think they can be destroyed. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2955.62s)]
*  Like Prime's everywhere. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2959.94s)]
*  No, Prime? [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2960.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I feel it's everywhere. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2962.2599999999998s)]
*  It's popular. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2963.94s)]
*  It's like, how can you destroy that? [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2964.58s)]
*  Inshallah, things go upwards. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2966.1s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2969.7799999999997s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2970.5s)]
*  You know, God willing. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2972.2599999999998s)]
*  Inshallah. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2973.22s)]
*  God willing. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2974.1s)]
*  I may be Saudi Arabian. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2974.8199999999997s)]
*  But it might be tough. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2976.02s)]
*  We're doing a couple things right, and one of which is we're speaking directly to an [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2977.7799999999997s)]
*  audience that appreciates our product, likes the product. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2982.98s)]
*  It's a good, better for you product than our competitors, like all of them. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2986.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2991.2999999999997s)]
*  And... [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2991.8599999999997s)]
*  Casey Neistat gave you the shout out. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2992.5s)]
*  Casey's great. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2994.42s)]
*  He was on the pod and he was like, listen, I'll be honest. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2995.62s)]
*  Dog, the energy, I mean, I love the hydration, but the energy, I drink it before every workout. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=2998.18s)]
*  I don't have any crash and I'm in the best fucking shape of my life. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3003.46s)]
*  It's like my pre-workout, essentially. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3005.94s)]
*  Okay, so here's the thing that I'm trying to understand. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3007.3s)]
*  Where do you get the money to sponsor the soccer teams and the athletes? [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3010.34s)]
*  Peg WAP? [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3015.7000000000003s)]
*  That net profit, bruh. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3017.46s)]
*  Is it profit or is it investors going, yo? [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3018.9s)]
*  That's net profit. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3021.2200000000003s)]
*  We have no investors. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3021.86s)]
*  We have zero investors. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3023.38s)]
*  Prime has six owners. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3025.0600000000004s)]
*  Two of them are managers, me and JJ's managers. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3027.3s)]
*  The four main ones are under the age of 30. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3030.42s)]
*  Team of wizards. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3033.6200000000003s)]
*  Sorry, not me. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3035.86s)]
*  The team that we are partnered with, they're fucking wizards. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3037.3s)]
*  They're really good. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3041.54s)]
*  I thought you had some Saudi money and they were paying all the soccer teams. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3042.5800000000004s)]
*  You guys are paying the soccer teams and the athlete. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3047.1400000000003s)]
*  Can we announce the Holland thing? [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3050.42s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3051.6200000000003s)]
*  That's why I asked if it would come out. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3052.1800000000003s)]
*  We're announcing it tomorrow. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3053.2200000000003s)]
*  Okay, Erling Holland is the latest sponsored athlete. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3054.02s)]
*  Which is unbelievable. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3057.94s)]
*  We've been working on that for eight months. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3058.7400000000002s)]
*  For America, I don't think that we understand what it is. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3059.86s)]
*  He's the guy, right? [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3063.38s)]
*  I was told there's a chance that him and Mbappe could be the Ronaldo and Messi of this generation. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3065.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3070.8199999999997s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3071.14s)]
*  Which is like, and it'd be like catching LeBron James in 2006. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3071.62s)]
*  We got him on a podcast. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3075.54s)]
*  We got all our assets. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3076.66s)]
*  We made him... [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3078.1s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3078.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's insane. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3079.46s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3081.14s)]
*  I don't even... [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3081.7799999999997s)]
*  It's hard to comprehend. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3082.58s)]
*  He fits the brand. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3083.38s)]
*  He's so fun. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3084.02s)]
*  Yeah, he's awesome, dude. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3085.06s)]
*  He's a great kid. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3086.2599999999998s)]
*  Wait, why was it eight months to make that happen? [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3087.06s)]
*  We had a hard time catching him in his location because he trains all year round and just deal points. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3089.94s)]
*  The kid's hot, dude. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3097.3s)]
*  He's got deals on the table. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3098.5s)]
*  Why partner with Prime? [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3100.26s)]
*  Did you have to beat out the competition? [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3101.54s)]
*  Was there another offer? [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3104.7400000000002s)]
*  We have to beat out a lot of competition for this. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3105.7s)]
*  Even to get the UFC bid, Arsenal, some of the new teams were signing. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3108.34s)]
*  Can you... [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3114.26s)]
*  We'll bleep it out. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3114.66s)]
*  How much does it cost to sponsor a soccer team? [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3115.46s)]
*  It changes on each one. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3118.1800000000003s)]
*  You have to bleep it out if I say it. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3119.62s)]

*  Wow. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3122.7400000000002s)]
*  The ROI is great on that. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3123.78s)]
*  Of course. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3125.2200000000003s)]
*  Here's what we do, bro. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3126.58s)]
*  Maximize profits and cut costs. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3127.38s)]
*  What is the cost cut? [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3129.38s)]
*  Oh, you don't have to pay for ads. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3130.6600000000003s)]
*  You guys are the ads. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3132.1800000000003s)]
*  It's the fucking Tesla model. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3133.86s)]
*  Elon never put an advertisement on TV once. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3136.02s)]

*  because I thought that you had investors and I thought the whole plan was [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3220.02s)]
*  we are going to oil money sports drinks in the same way that they've oil moneyed soccer players. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=3223.8599999999997s)]

*  Obviously he was going to do that. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4315.16s)]
*  Like he would have sent the same message if he just killed him right after. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4317.32s)]
*  Why didn't you just kill him right after? [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4321.24s)]
*  Homeboy was soft. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4322.36s)]

*  He said go to Belarus. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4328.2s)]
*  He said go to Belarus and you're good. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4330.84s)]

*  After you go, okay, I felt the top. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4435.8s)]
*  Is are you motivated by money now? [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4439.16s)]
*  Because you're like, all right, I already got all the fame and I'm kind of, [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4441.64s)]
*  it doesn't make me feel any different. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4444.12s)]
*  Let me see if all the money in the world makes me different. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4445.400000000001s)]
*  No, no. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4447.72s)]
*  At one point I was motivated by goals, goals really. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4449.240000000001s)]
*  But have those goals shifted to financial ones? [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4452.280000000001s)]
*  No, I just want to be happy and do what I love. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4454.280000000001s)]
*  Which is? [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4456.360000000001s)]
*  I guess the answer would always just come back to entertain and create. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4458.76s)]
*  And create. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4464.04s)]
*  Create is very important because the bar for entertaining is getting very low. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4465.160000000001s)]
*  Which is why I'm good at what I do. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4469.64s)]
*  See, this is the thing that like, and that's why I sometimes I'll reference [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4474.84s)]
*  the 99 originals thing. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4478.76s)]
*  Like I was like, oh, he's making art. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4480.120000000001s)]
*  This is art. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4483.0s)]
*  When I fall back fully from social media, which will happen, [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4483.8s)]
*  and I no longer subject my life to the commentary of strangers, [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4487.72s)]
*  because that's a weird phenomenon that like any person in the limelight [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4494.52s)]
*  understands. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4499.8s)]
*  Like that's just so, like everyone just can say whatever they want about your life. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4500.28s)]
*  It's wild, but it's what we signed up for. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4504.28s)]
*  So okay, I'm here now, I'm going to do it. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4505.72s)]
*  But when I fall back finally, I'm going to do art. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4508.12s)]
*  I'm going to do art. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4511.96s)]
*  I don't think as Logan Paul. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4512.84s)]
*  I'm just going to fucking make art. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4514.12s)]
*  The 99 originals was art. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4516.76s)]
*  Thanks, bro. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4518.12s)]
*  I love that project. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4518.92s)]
*  And I'll be back. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4519.88s)]
*  Shifty put me on to that. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4520.76s)]
*  I'll be back. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4521.8s)]
*  I'll be doing more, bro. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4522.28s)]
*  I really love that shit. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4523.32s)]
*  It was these tiny little stories that were great. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4524.28s)]
*  They're delicious. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4526.84s)]
*  They were nutritious. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4527.88s)]
*  And by nutritious, I mean like you could really clearly see that there is like a story in there, [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4528.76s)]
*  but also art. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4532.76s)]
*  And I'm not against doing things for mainstream consumption because I think that's great. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4533.88s)]
*  But I think that right now what you're seeing, especially with like streaming culture, [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4539.24s)]
*  is it is so unbelievably entertaining. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4543.64s)]
*  But the only way to entertain every second of the day is to create a car crash. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4546.92s)]
*  And now there's no art whatsoever. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4551.4800000000005s)]
*  And that's the problem. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4555.64s)]
*  And I consume it. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4557.56s)]
*  I looked at I was watching this guy Fousey, right? [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4558.68s)]
*  Oh, dog. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4561.240000000001s)]
*  Remember like back in your generation of YouTubers, he was there. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4561.64s)]
*  And he comes back now and he's like all over my Instagram or TikTok algorithm. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4565.88s)]
*  And I'm watching it. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4570.84s)]
*  I'm going this is the most entertaining thing I've ever seen. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4571.64s)]
*  When he's around other people that stream, none of them talk because they know that there's [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4574.360000000001s)]
*  one person that is going to get all the gravity. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4579.0s)]
*  But at the same time, it's car crash every single time. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4582.92s)]
*  There's not enough art. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4585.240000000001s)]
*  And that is what you have to do when you have to entertain 12 hours in a row. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4586.52s)]
*  You cannot create art because art requires reflection, requires thought, [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4590.280000000001s)]
*  it requires passion and love. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4594.68s)]
*  A car crash doesn't. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4596.6s)]
*  So it's how do I create a car crash every single moment? [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4597.88s)]
*  And my concern is that there are people who started their careers with real art [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4600.52s)]
*  and they were beautiful creators that now are part of the streaming economy and have [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4605.0s)]
*  gone to an addiction of attention and completely disregarded their artistic side, [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4611.400000000001s)]
*  which they fucking had. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4617.8s)]
*  And they were like beautiful creators, beautiful creators. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4619.240000000001s)]
*  And now they're just like, okay, this is the latest guy who's hot. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4623.56s)]
*  I'll be involved in the car crash with him. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4627.240000000001s)]
*  This is the latest guy who's hot. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4629.48s)]
*  I'll be involved with the car crash with him. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4631.0s)]
*  I guess the reason why I want to talk to you about that specifically is that [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4634.679999999999s)]
*  I don't think that you've devolved to the car crash. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4639.0s)]
*  And I hope you don't because I've seen what you did with the 99 originals. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4641.639999999999s)]
*  And maybe it wasn't your most popular thing, but it was your most beautiful thing. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4645.08s)]
*  Thanks. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4648.839999999999s)]
*  So don't do the car crash. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4650.599999999999s)]
*  Thanks. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4652.12s)]
*  And what do you feel about it? [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4653.48s)]
*  I feel my life is a car crash. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4654.28s)]
*  Like I am the car crash. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4656.36s)]
*  But boxing is art. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4657.5599999999995s)]
*  No, it's just a... [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4659.4s)]
*  Boxing requires skill, requires time, requires patience. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4660.04s)]
*  It's not just boxing. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4663.0s)]
*  You know, like I think you're right. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4663.879999999999s)]
*  First off, we were talking about this on the way over here. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4666.04s)]
*  Like we are in a dark time. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4667.719999999999s)]
*  What is happening? [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4669.16s)]
*  It's a sign of the times. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4669.879999999999s)]
*  It's... [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4671.5599999999995s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4671.799999999999s)]
*  I think in the age of media, everything is so oversaturated now. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4673.24s)]
*  Humans are wired to be attracted to and pay attention to negativity for some reason, [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4678.759999999999s)]
*  more than positivity. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4685.16s)]
*  We like seeing... [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4686.44s)]
*  Biological responses. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4686.919999999999s)]
*  We like seeing things get fucked up. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4688.04s)]
*  We like seeing things collapse. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4689.8s)]
*  It's weird to be... [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4691.56s)]
*  Like you ever be with someone in the morning who's like, [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4693.32s)]
*  dude, how fucking are you, bro? [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4696.36s)]
*  Good morning, man. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4697.56s)]
*  Like shut the fuck up. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4698.12s)]
*  That positivity and being... [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4700.28s)]
*  Too much. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4702.12s)]
*  Being about it, transpiring it is rare. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4703.32s)]
*  Like humans don't... [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4709.0s)]
*  I think wired that way maybe. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4713.16s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4714.5199999999995s)]
*  There's a... [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4715.16s)]
*  Fuck, there's a philosopher. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4715.64s)]
*  They say that we're drawn to the negativity because it was a biological response to keep [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4717.88s)]
*  us safe, right? [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4722.2s)]
*  It's like if you think that there's a snake over there and you hear some ruffling, [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4722.92s)]
*  I have to pay attention to that because that could save my life. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4726.04s)]
*  So now it's like if anything is potentially dangerous, [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4729.96s)]
*  we have this hardwired response to pay attention to it because it could potentially save our life. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4733.16s)]
*  Now we're watching things through screens, [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4738.2s)]
*  but it's playing off of biological impulses from millions of years ago. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4740.04s)]
*  Totally. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4743.32s)]
*  They use it to make money. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4743.8s)]
*  Also, yeah. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4744.84s)]
*  Murder in the neighborhood. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4745.8s)]
*  Find out more in two hours. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4746.84s)]
*  It's like, what? [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4747.96s)]
*  I gotta wait two hours to do this. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4748.6s)]
*  You ever watch mainstream news, like the news that your parents watch? [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4750.6s)]
*  It's all just fucking killings, murder, shooting, robbery. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4754.04s)]
*  It's just shit. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4756.6s)]
*  You wonder why old people get grumpy. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4757.16s)]
*  They're all grumpy because they're watching now. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4758.76s)]
*  That's all they watch is how horrible the neighborhood is. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4760.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4762.4400000000005s)]
*  The neighborhood is going to shit. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4763.24s)]
*  Well, yeah, every time you turn on the TV, it looks like the neighborhood is going to shit. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4764.360000000001s)]
*  Also, San Antonio is not the neighborhood. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4767.56s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4769.16s)]
*  What happens over there is not the neighborhood. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4769.56s)]
*  And also, I think we're drawn to the thing that we have least. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4771.64s)]
*  So most people have a general positive day. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4775.72s)]
*  I see. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4780.4400000000005s)]
*  So if everybody's just posting about their day, it's just all positive boring shit. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4781.16s)]
*  You have one somebody actually is like, hey, I'm creating chaos and I'm posting that. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4786.2s)]
*  It's going to. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4790.76s)]
*  You ever watch news in Canada? [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4791.64s)]
*  No. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4793.64s)]
*  They're like, the penguins in the zoo had a child. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4793.96s)]
*  And you're just like, what the fuck is this? [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4799.08s)]
*  No, that shit sucks. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4800.76s)]
*  It sucks. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4801.64s)]
*  Our news is lit. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4802.76s)]
*  I get it. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4803.72s)]
*  That's why they're so nice. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4803.96s)]
*  I get it. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4804.76s)]
*  There's a murder on the loose. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4805.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, we got to get them. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4807.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4808.5199999999995s)]
*  They got to find them. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4809.08s)]
*  Of course you're going to watch that. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4810.12s)]
*  I think that's why other countries are obsessed with our news, our politics. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4811.4s)]
*  They know what the fuck is going on here because it's lit. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4814.44s)]
*  I was looking at the, bro, I'm watching the Fousey guy and I'm like, holy shit, [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4817.0s)]
*  this is arguably one of the most entertaining individuals I've ever seen. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4821.08s)]
*  While at the same time, I was like, imagine this guy funneled this level of entertainment [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4825.16s)]
*  into an art. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4830.04s)]
*  What would that become? [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4831.72s)]
*  Well, and it'd be less profitable. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4833.56s)]
*  It'd be less profitable, but I think that you would have salvation in it because at [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4835.8s)]
*  the end of the day you'd go, oh, wow, I'm really proud of what I've put out despite [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4840.52s)]
*  people enjoying it. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4847.08s)]
*  And then when people enjoy it, it's the icing on the cake. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4848.2s)]
*  Like I imagine you tell me if I'm wrong, when somebody talked to you about the 99 [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4852.04s)]
*  originals and was like, yo, that shit was one. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4856.28s)]
*  Does that feel better than a vlog that you put out? [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4858.2s)]
*  100%. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4864.28s)]
*  Because you're proud as fuck. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4865.0s)]
*  That's my heart, soul, creation from my being. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4866.84s)]
*  Like that project, my most proud project of my life. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4870.28s)]
*  Find your art, man. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4873.8s)]
*  Kevin, my videographer slash little bro slash roommate, shot the whole project. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4875.16s)]
*  Beautiful. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4879.48s)]
*  Those whole 99 days. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4879.96s)]
*  He's like, dude, I watched the trailer the other day and I started crying. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4880.92s)]
*  That whole journey was so transformative. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4883.24s)]
*  And like, find your art and lean into it and get addicted to that. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4885.4s)]
*  Once you have the money to be addicted to your art, lean into that. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4890.2s)]
*  If you have money and you're still addicted to the attention, your life is going to be [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4893.5599999999995s)]
*  miserable 100% guarantee. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4898.04s)]
*  But it's a leap. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4900.2s)]
*  It's a leap and that's scary for a lot of people. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4901.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4902.76s)]
*  Like that car crash, bro. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4903.24s)]
*  You know how easy it is to get in your car and run into a fucking wall versus sitting [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4904.5199999999995s)]
*  down brainstorming, trying to come up with all these ideas, actually executing them [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4908.2s)]
*  to perfection, taking the time to do it. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4912.12s)]
*  Like it's just. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4913.88s)]
*  It's not as it's not as a within the boxing. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4915.88s)]
*  Could you access earlier? [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4918.84s)]
*  Like why get back into the boxing? [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4920.28s)]
*  Because that's just what I see boxing is an art. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4922.599999999999s)]
*  But what they're doing, no offense, it's not like, hey, we are elite boxes. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4926.04s)]
*  We're just like, hey, we're good. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4932.84s)]
*  Instagram bitches are fighting as a car crash. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4934.44s)]
*  No bullshit. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4937.8s)]
*  What I've seen Jake go from from. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4939.16s)]
*  He saw I said Jake. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4942.679999999999s)]
*  No, I mean, deadass. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4943.639999999999s)]
*  Like what I saw him go from from his first fight to what he's doing now. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4944.5199999999995s)]
*  Phenomenal. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4947.48s)]
*  It's phenomenal. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4948.04s)]
*  So I'm like, wow, this guy's taking the art seriously. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4949.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4951.4s)]
*  And it's like, it's a beautiful thing to fucking see somebody put that type of dedication [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4951.96s)]
*  into their craft. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4956.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4957.5599999999995s)]
*  So I don't look at it as car crash. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4957.799999999999s)]
*  Even what I've seen with even what I've seen with some of the the fucking. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4959.5599999999995s)]
*  Give me some buzzwords or something. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4966.2s)]
*  No, not even buzzwords. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4967.32s)]
*  There's a face UFC fighter UFC fighter. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4968.12s)]
*  No, not Sean, but shout out to fucking Sean. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4973.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Sean. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4976.12s)]
*  Unbelievable, bro. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4976.599999999999s)]
*  Un-fucking-believable. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4977.639999999999s)]
*  I can't believe I'm blanking. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4979.639999999999s)]
*  Come on, bro. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4980.679999999999s)]
*  Come on. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4981.32s)]
*  Who? [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4981.5599999999995s)]
*  Who? [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4981.799999999999s)]
*  Just like what do you do? [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4982.44s)]
*  Stylebender. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4983.4s)]
*  Is he? [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4984.12s)]
*  Stylebender? [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4984.44s)]
*  Is he? [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4984.92s)]
*  No, it's going to come to me. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4985.24s)]
*  But my point is, my point is seeing somebody dedicate themselves to a craft in an art is [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4988.12s)]
*  a beautiful thing. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4993.0s)]
*  And especially when you see the execution of that craft. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4993.799999999999s)]
*  I love that. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4996.76s)]
*  I agree. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4997.48s)]
*  We are drawn to a fight because we're human beings. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=4997.96s)]
*  And if there's a fight anywhere, we're going to watch it. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5001.32s)]
*  But at least if there's craft there. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5003.72s)]
*  Yes. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5005.72s)]
*  But every single fighter we speak to, they look at it like, hey, I'm in it for this period [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5005.96s)]
*  of time. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5012.2s)]
*  And I'm looking at my point where I get out of it. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5012.92s)]
*  But because there's a cost to fight. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5015.48s)]
*  Yes. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5016.92s)]
*  And the cost is the highest. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5017.16s)]
*  So why take that cost? [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5018.36s)]
*  Like why? [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5019.5599999999995s)]
*  Good question. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5020.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5021.32s)]
*  Why you put yourself up to that cost? [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5021.48s)]
*  I think it's because I am doing what I love. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5023.24s)]
*  I love to entertain. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5025.8s)]
*  I love the idea of being a modern day gladiator. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5027.08s)]
*  That's so fucking cool to me, dude. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5029.64s)]
*  Because I'm capable of it too, right? [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5031.320000000001s)]
*  I got this frame. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5033.08s)]
*  I got a good base of athletics to do this thing. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5033.88s)]
*  At least a little bit. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5039.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5039.8s)]
*  At least a little bit. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5040.04s)]
*  Enter the showmanship. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5040.84s)]
*  Enter the entertainment, the build up, the feeling of winning and accomplishing a goal. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5042.360000000001s)]
*  Like it's all there. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5046.04s)]
*  Which is why I'll sit here and say I don't want to be a full-time professional boxer. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5047.88s)]
*  I don't have these dreams of becoming the best boxer in the world because of the cost. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5051.8s)]
*  I'm not here forever. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5055.24s)]
*  If I have an opportunity to put on a couple big fights and entertain people, challenge myself, [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5056.44s)]
*  which is half of the... [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5060.76s)]
*  I'm not afraid of looking failure in the face. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5062.04s)]
*  I'm just not. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5063.8s)]
*  I've done it a hundred times. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5064.36s)]
*  And when I'm at those lows or highs is when I learn the most about myself and then can take that [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5065.4s)]
*  and become the best person I can. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5071.4s)]
*  Is there somebody that you have in mind? [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5073.0s)]
*  Let's assume that you beat Dylan. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5075.08s)]
*  And let's assume you have three, four, five more big fights. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5077.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5081.4s)]
*  Is there like an end goal? [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5082.04s)]
*  Or is there a dream fight? [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5085.88s)]
*  Nah, no, I would like to fight Connor. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5087.16s)]
*  I think it'd be really cool. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5090.36s)]
*  I think it'd be really cool. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5091.48s)]
*  Do you think you're too big for him? [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5092.12s)]
*  I could cut to 185 and he's like 181, 175. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5094.5199999999995s)]
*  What are you now? [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5099.08s)]
*  You probably are too... [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5099.72s)]
*  200 foot. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5100.76s)]
*  Okay. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5102.44s)]
*  So you could cut just if you're cutting water and everything. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5102.68s)]
*  I could get there. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5104.68s)]
*  I could get there. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5105.16s)]
*  No. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5105.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5105.96s)]
*  But size-wise, Connor was most effective at 145. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5106.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5111.639999999999s)]
*  But we'll always come back to like he's a professional fighter. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5111.88s)]
*  I'm a YouTuber, you know? [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5114.52s)]
*  And so that's supposed to be the give and take of it. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5115.64s)]
*  Like why would I, a YouTuber whose own one, [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5118.04s)]
*  have any business beating the great Connor McGregor? [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5120.84s)]
*  Like on paper... [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5123.64s)]
*  You did it. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5125.8s)]
*  You did it. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5126.36s)]
*  The great Connor McGregor. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5127.0s)]
*  I got to get an Irish accent down. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5136.04s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5139.4800000000005s)]
*  It's hard. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5140.04s)]
*  Some of those dialogues are hard. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5140.6s)]
*  All right. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5142.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5142.52s)]
*  Pivot real quick. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5143.24s)]
*  So we had Gideon here and I asked him... [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5144.12s)]
*  Yeah, why y'all beef? [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5146.36s)]
*  I don't like this. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5147.08s)]
*  I asked him personally like what that shit was. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5147.400000000001s)]
*  He gave his... [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5150.2s)]
*  When? [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5150.68s)]
*  He was on the pot. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5151.56s)]
*  Within the last day? [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5152.84s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5154.04s)]
*  They beefed afterwards. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5155.16s)]
*  They beefed at Manchester. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5157.0s)]
*  Gideon was at Manchester. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5158.2s)]
*  Yeah, but they beefed prior to that and then they beefed again after. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5159.24s)]
*  Oh, I thought you guys were beefing prior. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5162.12s)]
*  There was no beef, dog. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5162.92s)]
*  I mean... [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5164.4400000000005s)]
*  What happened at the fight? [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5165.08s)]
*  Gideon went ape shit on my brother. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5167.96s)]
*  I texted him because I was friends with him. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5171.0s)]
*  I said, I think you went a little too far. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5172.84s)]
*  If you ever want to handle something with Jake, just call me, dude. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5174.84s)]
*  There's no reason to go at his exes. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5176.76s)]
*  He went from zero to a hundred on my brother. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5180.28s)]
*  But break down the whole shit because you did... [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5185.16s)]
*  You were sitting on the couch. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5188.2s)]
*  You were home. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5189.16s)]
*  I don't know, but you did call him a bitch or some shit like that. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5190.04s)]
*  Wait, when? [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5192.28s)]
*  You called him a bitch. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5193.24s)]
*  You were sitting next to Jake and some other people. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5194.84s)]
*  Oh, no, it was about the... [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5197.4s)]
*  You talk about when I asked him to move? [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5198.84s)]
*  You guys were sitting next to each other at the fight. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5199.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5202.360000000001s)]
*  I didn't call him a bitch. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5202.6s)]
*  He called him something. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5204.12s)]
*  No, I didn't call him anything. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5204.84s)]
*  He broke it down on the fight and he was like, hey, you came at him and that's why he responded. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5205.400000000001s)]
*  No, Jake said that. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5209.88s)]
*  Hold on, can I pee? [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5210.52s)]
*  I want to pee, but I want to listen to this. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5211.320000000001s)]
*  No, I thought it was that. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5213.0s)]
*  It was Logan. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5214.12s)]
*  Hold on, hold on, hold on. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5214.84s)]
*  No, I didn't know if there was... [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5215.4800000000005s)]
*  You guys keep going if you need to. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5217.320000000001s)]
*  So why does he feel that... [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5218.4400000000005s)]
*  Why are you calling him two-faced? [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5220.4400000000005s)]
*  Explain the whole situation. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5221.8s)]
*  It's... First off, I hate giving this narrative any fucking fuel [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5222.76s)]
*  because I don't give a fuck. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5229.0s)]
*  I just don't. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5230.92s)]
*  We were at a UFC event. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5234.28s)]
*  He was sitting next to us and there was a camera, a live streaming camera in our face. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5237.08s)]
*  I didn't feel like being live streamed. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5243.96s)]
*  God strike me down. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5246.28s)]
*  So I politely asked him, very politely, and this is all on video. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5247.72s)]
*  I never called him a bitch. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5250.76s)]
*  He's my friend. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5251.64s)]
*  We worked together with Prime. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5252.6s)]
*  I was like, hey, bro, do you mind switching seats with me just so you could face the other way? [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5254.04s)]
*  Because I just don't feel like being live streamed all night. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5257.0s)]
*  Please don't be mad at me, Gideon. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5258.92s)]
*  This is coming from a nice place. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5260.04s)]
*  I'm not good at messaging. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5261.72s)]
*  Whatever I said, it was polite. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5262.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5264.6s)]
*  I think it rubbed him a little bit of the wrong way. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5265.56s)]
*  Because I get content creation, especially being a young creator. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5269.4800000000005s)]
*  He's in the heat of it, dude, and he's doing great. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5274.12s)]
*  His numbers are great. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5275.96s)]
*  He's got a loyal audience. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5277.72s)]
*  W's in the chat for Gideon. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5278.84s)]
*  And so I think it may have rubbed him the wrong way. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5281.16s)]
*  Hey, dude. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5285.0s)]
*  I'm out of it. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5286.76s)]
*  I'm out of it. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5287.56s)]
*  I'm not daily vlogging. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5288.12s)]
*  I'm not doing the live streams. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5289.16s)]
*  I value the time and privacy I have with my girl at these events that we come to a lot. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5291.08s)]
*  I think it rubbed him the wrong way a little bit. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5297.24s)]
*  Then he snapped on my brother. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5299.24s)]
*  And people can say that I'm a bad brother and all this shit, but I only have so much [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5301.4s)]
*  tolerance for people who are talking shit about Jake, including Bradley Martin recently, [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5306.92s)]
*  who came out and said some shit about Jake. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5310.04s)]
*  Wait, what happened with Bradley? [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5310.92s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5312.2s)]
*  I love Bradley. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5313.24s)]
*  No. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5313.96s)]
*  Stop, stop, stop. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5314.94s)]
*  So I texted Gideon. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5316.14s)]
*  I was like, hey, bro, I think you went a little too far with Jake. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5317.18s)]
*  Hopped on the phone. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5319.18s)]
*  I was like, Dave, you ever want to clear anything up? [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5319.82s)]
*  And he apologized or whatever. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5321.26s)]
*  Because he was talking about his ex and all the deepest cuts you could go for with Jake. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5322.86s)]
*  He did in one live stream. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5329.66s)]
*  But this was a mutual ex, right? [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5330.86s)]
*  No, it was Jake's. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5333.58s)]
*  It was Jake's. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5334.3s)]
*  It was like the controversy back then. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5334.94s)]
*  Anyways, anyways, I think both of those things, which I can say confidently, [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5338.14s)]
*  I was within reason. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5343.26s)]
*  I don't think either of those are out of the ordinary. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5345.5s)]
*  Kind of rubbed in the wrong way. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5349.98s)]
*  So when this Dylan shit started coming out, and by the way, that was the extent of my [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5351.58s)]
*  conversation with Gideon. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5356.14s)]
*  Then when this Dylan shit started coming out, Gideon's stoking the fire with Dylan. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5357.74s)]
*  Fucking get back on Twitter. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5362.54s)]
*  You're the funniest guy ever. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5363.58s)]
*  And so in my head, I'm like, you worked with us, with Prime. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5364.7s)]
*  You've been on my podcast. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5368.94s)]
*  We're friends. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5370.14s)]
*  We have open dialogue. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5370.78s)]
*  I even gave you advice with some stuff in your career. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5372.46s)]
*  Because of these two things that I think were very reasonable, why are you completely [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5375.9800000000005s)]
*  flipping to someone who is an evil human, especially as a person who is as supposedly [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5381.74s)]
*  good virtue as Gideon is? [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5388.7s)]
*  He's a good guy. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5390.3s)]
*  Why choose Dylan fucking Dennis, an actual evil human? [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5391.26s)]
*  Okay. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5396.78s)]
*  Why? [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5397.26s)]
*  So that's why. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5398.22s)]
*  Did you ask him that? [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5398.86s)]
*  I didn't ask him. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5401.02s)]
*  I was in Manchester, and I knew this was going to happen. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5401.74s)]
*  He was backstage. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5405.58s)]
*  He turped me. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5406.219999999999s)]
*  He's like, hey, Logan, can we switch seats real quick? [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5406.78s)]
*  He was trolling me in person. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5409.5s)]
*  And I was, I don't know, testosterone swine. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5410.78s)]
*  You charged up. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5413.34s)]
*  I was at this press conference. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5413.98s)]
*  I just threw a cake of Dylan Dennis, his head at Dylan Dennis. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5415.0199999999995s)]
*  And I was just like, yo, you're two-faced. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5418.139999999999s)]
*  And he's like, yo, dude, what about you and KSI? [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5419.98s)]
*  It won't be real with KSI. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5421.98s)]
*  I didn't understand what he was saying. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5425.099999999999s)]
*  And he says he doesn't need to be real with me because I'm not real. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5427.0199999999995s)]
*  But I've only kept it real with Jidi on. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5431.18s)]
*  I don't know the young man. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5434.700000000001s)]
*  I think you guys need to connect together. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5436.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I do need to connect. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5438.06s)]
*  He's a good guy. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5439.18s)]
*  He's a good dude. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5439.900000000001s)]
*  You're a good guy too? [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5441.18s)]
*  So what happened? [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5442.06s)]
*  Tell me what happened, bro. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5442.9400000000005s)]
*  I'm just saying, I asked him, and I'm asking you, and I'm hearing two different stories. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5444.22s)]
*  But it sounds like you told a different story. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5447.18s)]
*  I never called him a bitch until three days ago, ever. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5448.22s)]
*  He felt justified to respond in the way that he did. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5450.9400000000005s)]
*  That's insane to me. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5454.46s)]
*  Because even after I did that, he goes for the deepest cuts he can. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5456.06s)]
*  What's the deepest cut? [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5460.78s)]
*  Just saying, bro, I've done a lot. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5462.139999999999s)]
*  I'm roastable. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5466.219999999999s)]
*  There's some things that you can say and some things that you know. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5467.82s)]
*  Like, all right, I'm going for his fucking jugular. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5472.139999999999s)]
*  And he did that. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5474.62s)]
*  Like, what are you doing going zero to 100? [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5475.419999999999s)]
*  You know? [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5477.339999999999s)]
*  He's a young creator. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5482.62s)]
*  I think he's... [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5484.139999999999s)]
*  I'm not even... [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5486.219999999999s)]
*  I don't give a fuck, bro. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5486.94s)]
*  I'm not even gonna comment. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5487.82s)]
*  I have no business on trying to assume what's going on in his life. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5489.1s)]
*  God bless him. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5492.54s)]
*  We need to have a dinner together. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5493.26s)]
*  We need to have a no cameras, no nothing dinner together. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5494.780000000001s)]
*  Did you enjoy the press conference? [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5497.900000000001s)]
*  Did you feel like it was... [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5498.9400000000005s)]
*  I really liked it. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5499.820000000001s)]
*  Do you feel like it's productive and push the fight in the right way? [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5501.34s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5503.58s)]
*  Hold on one second. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5505.18s)]
*  Why? [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5505.820000000001s)]
*  I feel like you crossed the line with the cake. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5507.42s)]
*  No. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5510.3s)]
*  The cake? [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5510.54s)]
*  The things you said about his mom. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5511.34s)]
*  The cake? [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5513.26s)]
*  So I'm just saying... [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5514.22s)]
*  Logan Paul the cake? [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5515.26s)]

*  You're wild. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5526.14s)]
*  You don't think that's crossing the line? [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5526.78s)]
*  Brother, why do you think I said anything about his mother? [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5528.62s)]
*  Okay, but if you feel he crossed the line and now you're just meeting him at the line, [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5533.5s)]
*  you're equally as wrong. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5537.58s)]
*  Two wrongs don't make a right. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5539.1s)]

*  No, I'm just saying... [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5541.82s)]
*  What is the mom shit? [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5542.7s)]
*  I called her a parachute. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5543.74s)]
*  I'm just saying. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5547.02s)]
*  What does that even mean? [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5552.62s)]
*  If you crossed the line, not everything. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5553.900000000001s)]
*  No, what's a parachute? [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5555.58s)]
*  Someone tell me. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5557.58s)]
*  It doesn't matter what it means. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5558.22s)]
*  It's provocative. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5559.18s)]
*  It is provocative, but can you explain what that means? [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5559.74s)]
*  I call her parakeet. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5564.06s)]
*  A parakeet? [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5565.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's some word like that. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5566.46s)]
*  I blacked out. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5569.34s)]
*  But what I was saying was like, bro, I have to be honest, that's wild for you to say that. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5571.1s)]
*  Do you understand you're in New York? [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5577.1s)]
*  You say mother anything that's a fight. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5578.14s)]
*  What about my fucking fiance? [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5581.1s)]
*  Real talk, mom's kind of... [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5583.58s)]
*  Until it's wife, mom is there. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5589.26s)]

*  Okay. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5870.54s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5871.04s)]
*  Tell us, bro. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5871.58s)]
*  We swept these in here, bro. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5872.54s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5873.98s)]
*  So you left your concert. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5874.46s)]
*  Come on, son. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5875.74s)]
*  It was one of the greatest things ever, bro. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5876.14s)]
*  We were upset. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5877.34s)]
*  We couldn't have been, we couldn't go. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5877.9s)]
*  How'd you not pull up? [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5879.18s)]
*  I just didn't. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5880.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5881.58s)]
*  You were in a hot tub. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5881.9s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5883.9s)]
*  Okay. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5884.62s)]
*  You're putting him in, bro. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5885.9s)]
*  That's fucked up. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5887.18s)]
*  Yeah, that's fucked up. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5887.9s)]
*  You're putting him in hot water right now. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5888.94s)]
*  Bro, don't do that. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5890.54s)]
*  Are you trying to put me in hot water, bro? [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5891.58s)]
*  You're putting yourself in a hot tub. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5893.42s)]
*  You gotta stop that. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5894.54s)]
*  I wish we had a hot tub commons game right now, bro. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5896.14s)]
*  I wish we could go back. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5897.9800000000005s)]
*  You gotta stop that. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5898.86s)]
*  Mark, you gotta stop that, too. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5901.02s)]
*  I wish we could go back. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5902.14s)]
*  You gotta stop that. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5903.26s)]
*  If I had a hot tub time, you see I'd go back. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5904.54s)]
*  It'd take away my hot tub commons. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5907.34s)]
*  Listen, listen. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5908.9400000000005s)]
*  There has to be more respect. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5909.82s)]
*  Both lines have been crossed. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5911.5s)]
*  So maybe me and Dylan, maybe we make amends. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5913.9s)]
*  We call off the fight and become buddies [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5917.26s)]
*  and start a beverage company. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5919.1s)]
*  The greatest story told again. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5920.14s)]
*  How would you describe the intelligence of your audience? [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5925.42s)]
*  That's an awesome question. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5929.900000000001s)]
*  Like IQ range, where would they be? [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5931.18s)]
*  Sure, sure. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5934.780000000001s)]
*  If that's how you want to quantify intelligence. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5935.5s)]
*  I think our audience, this is what I think of our audience. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5937.900000000001s)]
*  I think our audience would listen to like a Lex Friedman podcast [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5942.3s)]
*  and be like, yeah, I get it. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5946.700000000001s)]
*  There's problems in the world. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5949.18s)]
*  But why are you guys being so gay about it? [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5950.38s)]
*  You kind of nailed it. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5954.54s)]
*  I genuinely think they would understand [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5955.900000000001s)]
*  a geopolitical argument between Israel, Palestine, [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5958.3s)]
*  saying, okay, yap, yap, yap, let's go. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5962.06s)]
*  Like, who cares? [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5964.860000000001s)]
*  But they would understand every single thing [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5965.740000000001s)]
*  that they're saying about it. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5967.18s)]
*  I think they're smart. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5969.02s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5970.22s)]
*  That's why I came on this podcast. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5971.1s)]
*  Bro, we know, my boy, we know, my boy. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5972.700000000001s)]
*  I want it to be heard. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5974.700000000001s)]
*  You're always heard. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5976.46s)]
*  No, by some people with brains. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5977.5s)]
*  What are you trying to say, dude? [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5979.34s)]
*  I feel like you're trying to say something about. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5980.54s)]
*  I think. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5982.62s)]
*  You gotta relax. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5982.94s)]
*  People are fucking stupid. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5984.94s)]
*  But you're not, what do you mean? [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5986.38s)]
*  How could I be any more clear about that? [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5990.38s)]
*  Do you think it impulsive the audience is dumb? [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5992.22s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=5994.78s)]

*  Just in the abyss. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=6216.32s)]
*  Rogan's a bad guy. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=6217.6s)]
*  Something's off about this. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFq3S5q6Hh0&t=6218.24s)]
