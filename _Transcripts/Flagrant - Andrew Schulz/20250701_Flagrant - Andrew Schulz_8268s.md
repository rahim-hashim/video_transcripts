**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [July 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y)
*  And we're back! Listen, we go away for one week and New York City turns into a Muslim Communist Utopia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=0.0s)]
*  What the f*** happened? When we went away, right? We had the guy that killed all the old people and was f***ing his employees. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. He was an upstanding guy! [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=15.32s)]
*  He was going to be mayor. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=16.62s)]
*  He should have been. That's a good guy. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=17.900000000000002s)]
*  I thought no matter what, we're still getting 11, right? If Cuomo or Mayor Adams wins, we get 11. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=19.900000000000002s)]
*  I don't even want to know what 11 looks like if Mom Donnie is going to be mayor. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=25.92s)]
*  Put a 9 in front of it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=29.92s)]
*  Alright, don't do that. Don't do that, guys. That's racist. That's racist. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=30.92s)]
*  I stand with Zolan. I'm sorry, dude. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=34.92s)]
*  That was really good. That was really good. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=37.92s)]
*  Hey, hey, hey. Do it a second time. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=40.92s)]
*  No, no, no. No sound tower. Go on, dude. That's crazy. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=42.92s)]
*  I don't know. I kind of thought it bombed. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=45.92s)]
*  Yo, what happened, man? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=47.92s)]
*  This guy had it, dude. Crazy momentum. People loved him. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=50.92s)]
*  You saw the thing happening. The last week or two before the election, I was like, oh, he got this. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=55.18s)]
*  I've been trying to tell you, man. He's out. He has people. They came to my door three times in the past two months. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=59.18s)]
*  Damn. So they know who got this. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=66.18s)]
*  So the rep was later. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=68.18s)]
*  No, but for real, how did they know to target you? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=70.18s)]
*  I mean, I live in Queens, so. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=73.18s)]
*  What? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=75.18s)]
*  I live in Queens. They want to come to me. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=76.18s)]
*  Yeah, but you're black. It's just like white kids that vote for him, right? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=77.18s)]
*  Isn't that the... [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=80.18s)]
*  No, I think it was white people and people also make over 100,000. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=81.44000000000001s)]
*  Okay! [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=85.44000000000001s)]
*  Damn! [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=87.44000000000001s)]
*  That's what they said, though. That's what they said. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=89.44000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I know. That's what they said. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=92.44000000000001s)]
*  That's what they said. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=94.44000000000001s)]
*  I didn't know I made that much. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=96.44000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, according to IRS, I do not. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=97.44000000000001s)]
*  It's... [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=99.44000000000001s)]
*  You just can't help it, right? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=101.44000000000001s)]
*  Isn't it just everybody with like $200,000 as student loans? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=103.44000000000001s)]
*  Like, isn't that... Exactly, right? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=106.44000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, probably. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=108.44000000000001s)]
*  I imagine this, and there's a guy named David Friedberg on All In who did a cool breakdown of it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=109.7s)]
*  Maybe we end up watching it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=113.7s)]
*  But this is kind of what I was feeling. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=115.7s)]
*  I didn't tie it to student loans, but when the socialist populism starts to happen, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=117.7s)]
*  usually it's when you just feel like there's no opportunity. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=122.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=126.7s)]
*  Right? That's usually what happens. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=127.7s)]
*  When you move to New York, you're coming here because you got some crazy dream [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=129.7s)]
*  and you're going to make it happen. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=132.7s)]
*  And when you come with like $200,000, $300,000 worth of debt, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=134.7s)]
*  you realize you have negative money, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=137.95999999999998s)]
*  and there's really no way that you're going to be able to escape that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=139.95999999999998s)]
*  So now you can't pursue this crazy dream of yours because you got this crippling debt. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  And then you got to go, okay, well, how can my life be kind of good as it is? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  And, well, now we need the government to tap in and make that happen. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  That's a very valid feeling, though. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  I completely understand everybody that has $200,000, $300,000 worth of student loan debt. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=158.95999999999998s)]
*  You know, not everyone. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=161.95999999999998s)]
*  Like if you decided to major in something crazy, like women... [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=164.22s)]
*  Women. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=171.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=173.22s)]
*  No, like if you just had some crazy major that there's no job you can ever get [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=174.22s)]
*  and you have $200,000 worth of student loans, like you're obviously being stupid. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=177.22s)]
*  But I do think there are a lot of people that maybe sold a dream with college [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=181.22s)]
*  and it just doesn't exactly work that way anymore. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=185.22s)]
*  And now they're in this situation where they're getting crushed by rent, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=187.22s)]
*  they're getting crushed by the cost of living, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=190.22s)]
*  and they really see no upward mobility. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=192.48s)]
*  So they're like, hey, I got to breathe here, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=194.48s)]
*  and this guy looks like he's going to give me a little wiggle room. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=196.48s)]
*  I completely understand why they're going for it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=198.48s)]
*  It's going to destroy the city and we're not going to get 11. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=200.48s)]
*  And it will happen, but that is okay. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=203.48s)]
*  It will happen. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=205.48s)]
*  Why do you feel it's going to destroy the city? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=207.48s)]
*  Because Venezuela or something the right-wing guys told me. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=209.48s)]
*  Right? Because it's going to be Venezuela. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=212.48s)]
*  That's what all the right-wing guys told me. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=214.48s)]
*  Inflation. Inflation. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=216.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's what they said. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=218.48s)]
*  I remember back in the 50s when there was like a 90% marginal tax rate [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=220.73999999999998s)]
*  and that's where the American dream started. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=222.73999999999998s)]
*  But Venezuela, guys! [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=224.73999999999998s)]
*  Venezuela is the issue. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=226.73999999999998s)]
*  We're going to be eating the zoo animals. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=228.73999999999998s)]
*  We're going to be eating the zoo animals. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=230.73999999999998s)]
*  Guys, we're not going to get a 9-11. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=232.73999999999998s)]
*  Dude, if they called New York's 11 9-11, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=234.73999999999998s)]
*  that would be insane, Mark. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=236.73999999999998s)]
*  You're so racist. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=238.73999999999998s)]
*  Two poles in the middle. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=240.73999999999998s)]
*  Everybody's... [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=242.73999999999998s)]
*  Two poles in the middle and exactly 9-20. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=244.73999999999998s)]
*  Hold up the money. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=246.73999999999998s)]
*  Exactly 9-20. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=249.0s)]
*  They just thought to combust. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=251.0s)]
*  This is not good to joke around. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=253.0s)]
*  This is extremely racist. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=255.0s)]
*  No, it's okay in Mumdani's New York. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=257.0s)]
*  Exactly. Mumdani's New York, we joke around. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=259.0s)]
*  Listen, we're globalizing the NTFATA. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=261.0s)]
*  I don't even know what the fuck that shit is. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=263.0s)]
*  I thought it was a new Groove movie. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=265.0s)]
*  I didn't know it either. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=267.0s)]
*  That shit sounds hard, though. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=269.0s)]
*  I don't know what it means, but it sounds hard. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=271.0s)]
*  It sounds terrifying. I'm not going to lie. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=273.0s)]
*  Globalize the NTFATA. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=275.0s)]
*  I was in a group chat and, oh, Tanya came after my ass. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=277.26s)]
*  What did she say? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=280.26s)]
*  She just chewed me a new one and then I did some research [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=282.26s)]
*  and was like, oh, I'm talking about a different situation. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=284.26s)]
*  A different answer. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=286.26s)]
*  Oh, now you texted my bag? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=288.26s)]
*  So what is globalize the NTFATA [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=290.26s)]
*  and why was our soon-to-be mayor saying that shit? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=292.26s)]
*  I don't know what his actual... [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=296.26s)]
*  Did he say globalize the NTFATA? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=298.26s)]
*  I think he just refused to denounce a movement or whatever. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=300.26s)]
*  It's one of those. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=302.26s)]
*  No, I think he said it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=304.26s)]
*  It's like a lot of these... [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=306.26s)]
*  ...swears. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=308.26s)]
*  Iraq and a hard place. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=310.26s)]
*  You know you can do that, Robby. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=312.26s)]
*  Just pick it up, throw it in a tank. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=314.26s)]
*  Iraq and a hard place is just Iran. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=316.26s)]
*  No, because a lot of it... [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=322.26s)]
*  You need some crazy ideas to shake shit up [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=324.26s)]
*  and make some noise when you're a candidate [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=326.26s)]
*  that's pulling a zero, right? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=328.26s)]
*  So you need to say some wild shit [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=330.26s)]
*  so that you can get the attention of people [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=332.26s)]
*  and get those beliefs. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=334.26s)]
*  Yes, he took your advice. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=336.26s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=338.26s)]
*  But you gotta do it for comedy and post clips. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=340.26s)]
*  You can't do it for mayor, okay? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=342.26s)]
*  We need to marry fingers as employees. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=344.26s)]
*  Or have swag. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=346.26s)]
*  Listen, Mayor Adam sat on that seat, man, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=348.26s)]
*  and there's nothing more I gotta say about it. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=350.26s)]
*  Like, you felt the energy, didn't you? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=352.26s)]
*  You did. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=354.26s)]
*  He did. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=356.26s)]
*  Look, I dress nice now. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=358.26s)]
*  He did change the way you dress. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=360.26s)]
*  Did he say flamingo for your nails? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=362.26s)]
*  No, he didn't. What the fuck is this? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=364.26s)]
*  There was another where they started with that. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=366.26s)]
*  No, he did lie right to Alex's face, though. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=368.26s)]
*  What did he say to you? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=370.26s)]
*  I asked, are you running as a Democrat? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=372.26s)]
*  He told me, yes, absolutely. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=374.26s)]
*  And then the next day he came... [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=376.26s)]
*  Buddy, not even the next day. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=378.26s)]
*  Soon as we walk out of the interview, we go home. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=380.26s)]
*  He's announced he's running as an independent. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=382.26s)]
*  He saw Alex's nails, he's like, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=384.26s)]
*  I'm done with these Democrats. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=386.26s)]
*  I can't be taking these fairies to the promised land. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=388.26s)]
*  Let Mom Donnie handle that. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=390.26s)]
*  But yeah, you gotta say some wild shit. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=392.26s)]
*  And also it's probably like, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=394.26s)]
*  I don't know, you gotta have some pretty... [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=396.26s)]
*  You have to have a little bit more extreme ideas, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=398.26s)]
*  and then you galvanize those people on the extremes. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=400.26s)]
*  But now, when you have an actual shot to be mayor, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=402.26s)]
*  you don't want to lose them. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=404.26s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=406.26s)]
*  Because if you go, I was just kind of being hyperbolic [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=408.26s)]
*  and I was being a little bit crazy, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=410.26s)]
*  they all go, what the fuck is wrong with you? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=412.26s)]
*  So I saw a video recently of him at some event, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=414.26s)]
*  and there was some dude [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=416.26s)]
*  who was like Palestinian, came back and goes, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=418.26s)]
*  what do you mean you recognize Israel? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=420.26s)]
*  I supported you because... [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=422.26s)]
*  This is before the primary, to be fair. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=424.26s)]
*  Oh, that video? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=426.26s)]
*  I'm fairly certain it was before the primary. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=428.26s)]
*  It was right after the debate. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=430.26s)]
*  Oh, okay, got it, got it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=432.26s)]
*  So here's this thing where it's like you're trying to land the plane, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=434.26s)]
*  and guys, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=436.26s)]
*  I don't want to do any more 9-11. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=438.26s)]
*  This is extremely... [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=440.26s)]
*  Can we fucking... [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=442.26s)]
*  And you better vote for Eric Adams. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=444.26s)]
*  No 9-11 during Eric Adams. Can you at least give him credit for that? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=446.26s)]
*  That's true. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=448.26s)]
*  Not one. Kept the city safe. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=450.26s)]
*  You did. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=452.26s)]
*  Canal Street looks like Sudan. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=454.26s)]
*  Okay? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=458.26s)]
*  How did the Sudanese take over [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=460.26s)]
*  the Chinese main export [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=462.26s)]
*  in America, which is fake shit? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=464.26s)]
*  When did this happen? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=466.26s)]
*  The Hill Road Initiative, they took it over. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=468.26s)]
*  I've only known Africans to be selling the fake shit. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=470.26s)]
*  I assume that was how it always was. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=472.26s)]
*  When I was growing up, it was Chinese ladies. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=474.26s)]
*  China bought Africa, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=476.26s)]
*  and now the Africans are working for the Chinese. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=478.26s)]
*  They outsourced their Chineseness? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=480.26s)]
*  They put them on the corners now? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=482.26s)]
*  Donnie, you got to do something about that. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=484.26s)]
*  You got to get these Chinese people their jobs back. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=486.26s)]
*  I'm sick and tired [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=488.26s)]
*  of these Africans [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=490.26s)]
*  stealing these Chinese people's jobs. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=492.26s)]
*  So now he's got to land the plane, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=498.26s)]
*  and now he's got to be delicate about this shit. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=500.26s)]
*  When you're the guy who's pulling at zero, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=502.26s)]
*  you can say whatever the fuck you want. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=504.26s)]
*  I would see the Israel stuff, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=506.26s)]
*  and he would say, I believe Israel has [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=508.26s)]
*  a right to exist as a country, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=510.26s)]
*  and then he would say what they're doing is crazy, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=512.26s)]
*  which is how most of us feel. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=514.26s)]
*  So I think even before, on that... [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=516.26s)]
*  He said they have rights to this [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=518.26s)]
*  as long as they respect international law. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=520.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=522.26s)]
*  Yeah, that's nothing crazy. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=524.26s)]
*  The rest of them, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=526.26s)]
*  when every one of them were tap dancing [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=528.26s)]
*  on that debate stage... [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=530.26s)]
*  And he was the one that didn't do it. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=532.26s)]
*  That's when I was like, okay, this kid got some balls. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=534.26s)]
*  He's not bald. This is cool. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=536.26s)]
*  I think that was massive. There were some really nice... [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=538.26s)]
*  His social media team did a great job. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=540.26s)]
*  Dude, there's one moment of his mom coming out [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=542.26s)]
*  while he's campaigning, and he gives her a big hug [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=544.26s)]
*  and a kiss on the cheek, and she's like, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=546.26s)]
*  he's eating junk food, and she's worried. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=548.26s)]
*  It's really sweet and endearing. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=550.26s)]
*  So that made him look nice, and then dunking on Cuomo [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=552.26s)]
*  with that fucking, you're right, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=554.26s)]
*  I'm not like... That's when I was like, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=556.26s)]
*  he's ready. He's gonna ruin the city, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=558.26s)]
*  but he's ready. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=560.26s)]
*  He's gonna do it in style. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=562.26s)]
*  And he's gonna do it in an accent [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=564.26s)]
*  that nobody with immigrant parents from Queens [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=566.26s)]
*  has ever had. I know accents. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=568.26s)]
*  I have three. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=570.26s)]
*  None of them, I have three accents. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=572.26s)]
*  Most New Yorkers have between [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=574.26s)]
*  two and four accents. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=576.26s)]
*  So he's a real New Yorker. No, but this one, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=578.26s)]
*  we don't have here. There's no politician [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=580.26s)]
*  accent in New York. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=582.26s)]
*  When did he move here? Cause he went to school [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=584.26s)]
*  in London or whatever. So where's that click click shit? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=586.26s)]
*  Why isn't he clicking? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=588.26s)]
*  That's what I want. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=590.26s)]
*  I want him to be frustrated with someone [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=592.26s)]
*  and suck his teeth. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=594.26s)]
*  If you do that, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=596.26s)]
*  if he said that to Cuomo, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=598.26s)]
*  you're such a fucking [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=600.26s)]
*  cracker, man. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=602.26s)]
*  Can't even make African jokes [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=604.26s)]
*  around you, dude. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=606.26s)]
*  You don't even know what the fuck we're talking about. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=608.26s)]
*  When you're seven, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=610.26s)]
*  he probably shouldn't have an accent from you. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=612.26s)]
*  He doesn't have a bowl hanging from his bottom lip. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=614.26s)]
*  Are you from [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=618.26s)]
*  Africa or not? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=620.26s)]
*  Do you know what I'm saying? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=622.26s)]
*  Where's the bowl [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=624.26s)]
*  on your bottom lip, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=626.26s)]
*  sir? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=628.26s)]
*  Look at this guy. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=630.26s)]
*  He's got a regular lip. He is handsome. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=632.26s)]
*  I love this guy, dude. He is handsome. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=634.26s)]
*  Between him and Ewan, Africans are taking over [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=636.26s)]
*  American politics. Non-African Africans [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=638.26s)]
*  are crushing it. I mean, they've been ducking us, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=640.26s)]
*  but I like them. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=642.26s)]
*  That's the other thing. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=644.26s)]
*  What is it? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=646.26s)]
*  Cards on the table. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=648.26s)]
*  Put a nail in it or something like that. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=650.26s)]
*  Clear the slate, whatever, like that. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=652.26s)]
*  Clear the air? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=654.26s)]
*  Put a bow in his nose? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=656.26s)]
*  What is it? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=658.26s)]
*  What are you trying to say? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=660.26s)]
*  Let's put a bowl in the lip right now. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=662.26s)]
*  Listen, let's ring up the neck. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=664.26s)]
*  Let's ring up the neck. I don't even know if that's in Africa. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=668.26s)]
*  It might be like an Asian truck. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=670.26s)]
*  It's Malaysian. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=672.26s)]
*  Okay, so listen, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=674.26s)]
*  I've had a lot of people reach out, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=676.26s)]
*  you're going to have Mumdani on, okay? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=678.26s)]
*  Yeah, we've been trying to have them on. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=680.26s)]
*  And Mumdani, maybe your comms people [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=682.26s)]
*  aren't getting back to you or whatever it is, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=684.26s)]
*  but they've been ghosting us. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=686.26s)]
*  Initially, I think they were reaching out a lot. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=688.26s)]
*  You were in touch with them. They were really trying to come on. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=690.26s)]
*  We had to go to Ibiza before [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=692.26s)]
*  they wanted to turn this into expanding [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=694.26s)]
*  the caliphate to New York City. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=696.26s)]
*  Don't say we. What do you mean we? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=698.26s)]
*  The royal. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=700.26s)]
*  The royal. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=704.26s)]
*  Mumdani. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=706.26s)]
*  So, listen, we all went on [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=708.26s)]
*  vacation, right? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=710.26s)]
*  And, okay, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=712.26s)]
*  and then I come back from vacation. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=714.26s)]
*  I'm trying to email a comms person. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=716.26s)]
*  I DM them. They gave me a little cold [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=718.26s)]
*  shoulder when I DMed, and then somebody else in the DMs [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=720.26s)]
*  was like, oh, actually, yeah, yeah, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=722.26s)]
*  we're in touch with some people, blah, blah, blah. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=724.26s)]
*  And then I'm like, I'm trying to get him, like, a month and a half ago, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=726.26s)]
*  brown to brown, man to man interview. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=728.26s)]
*  He wouldn't even, nothing. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=730.26s)]
*  I'm just saying, you know, this is the biggest podcast [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=732.26s)]
*  in New York City by far. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=734.26s)]
*  You know, you have the ability to [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=736.26s)]
*  touch all these different people. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=738.26s)]
*  You're going to do these little live streams and these other things. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=740.26s)]
*  It probably could be a good idea [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=742.26s)]
*  to come. So maybe, Zora, maybe [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=744.26s)]
*  your people aren't telling you, or [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=746.26s)]
*  obviously things are kind of busy, but if you want it, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=748.26s)]
*  you want it. It's simple as that. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=750.26s)]
*  You know what I mean? If you want to be mayor of the greatest city in the world, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=752.26s)]
*  you got to touch everybody. So. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=754.26s)]
*  Yeah, take it from Cuomo. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=756.26s)]
*  That's how you got to do it. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=758.26s)]
*  But if you want to win, you got to touch everybody. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=760.26s)]
*  We just want to put it out right now so we don't have any of this election shit, right? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=762.26s)]
*  He's been asked. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=764.26s)]
*  His people are not getting back to us. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=766.26s)]
*  They were asking to come on [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=768.26s)]
*  a lot. After the win, they've kind of gone ghost. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=770.26s)]
*  Win on the primary, they've gone ghost. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=772.26s)]
*  So, Zora, maybe [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=774.26s)]
*  this will reach you, maybe some of [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=776.26s)]
*  us. I've also asked other people to go reach out to him, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=778.26s)]
*  whatever. I don't want to say they're ducking us. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=780.26s)]
*  I do. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=782.26s)]
*  So listen, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=784.26s)]
*  we have a seat right here. We'd love to sit down [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=786.26s)]
*  and talk to you about some of your policies [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=788.26s)]
*  and how you've managed to galvanize [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=790.26s)]
*  white losers to support you. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=792.26s)]
*  Son, there's no minorities [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=796.26s)]
*  have voted for him. I looked at the demographics. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=798.26s)]
*  I don't vote, but yeah, I would have. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=800.26s)]
*  I'm telling you, they don't. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=802.26s)]
*  It's all white people. It's all of [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=804.26s)]
*  Brooklyn. It's all of white Brooklyn [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=806.26s)]
*  voting for him. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=808.26s)]
*  All of Queens. Queens is [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=810.26s)]
*  the most diverse [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=812.26s)]
*  out of neighborhoods. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=814.26s)]
*  He had all of Queens. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=816.26s)]
*  He had his little neighborhood, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=818.26s)]
*  which is the whitest neighborhood in Queens. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=820.26s)]
*  He lost the Bronx. Of course he lost the Bronx, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=822.26s)]
*  because there's no white people there. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=824.26s)]
*  The only white person in the Bronx [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=826.26s)]
*  is the Yankees. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=828.26s)]
*  So yeah, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=830.26s)]
*  I want to know how he's galvanized. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=832.26s)]
*  What I assume it is, it has a lot to do [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=834.26s)]
*  with the college luncheon. So it's just like people who [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=836.26s)]
*  go to college. Obviously no one in the Bronx has ever done that, but [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=838.26s)]
*  people obviously [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=840.26s)]
*  look at it. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=842.26s)]
*  Is that what the Bronx is known for? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=844.26s)]
*  Higher education? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=846.26s)]
*  I can't talk about shit. What? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=848.26s)]
*  That's the four or five train away. They won't come down [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=850.26s)]
*  and smack the shit out of you. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=852.26s)]
*  They would prove my point. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=854.26s)]
*  They're busy drilling, dude. They're drilling. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=856.26s)]
*  They're drilling. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=858.26s)]
*  Okay? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=860.26s)]
*  No one in Bushwick, Fort Greene, or Williamsburg is [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=862.26s)]
*  drilling. Williamsburg they're drilling. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=864.26s)]
*  The Jews. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=866.26s)]
*  They're getting underground. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=868.26s)]
*  Because of tunnels. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=870.26s)]
*  No, that, Mumdani, are you going to allow the Jews to build [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=872.26s)]
*  tunnels wherever they want? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=874.26s)]
*  Did you see what happened in Borough Park? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=876.26s)]
*  No. 99% voted [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=878.26s)]
*  against Mumdani. It's the highest [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=880.26s)]
*  non-Mumdani neighborhood. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=882.26s)]
*  What is Borough Park? It's all Hasidic. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=884.26s)]
*  Oh, but I heard there are some Hasidic communities, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=886.26s)]
*  or there are some Jewish communities that actually supported him. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=888.26s)]
*  Maybe, but the Hasids are like [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=890.26s)]
*  the most like, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=892.26s)]
*  they just vote all together at once. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=894.26s)]
*  Yeah, singular brain. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=896.26s)]
*  They're like those, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=898.26s)]
*  what is that? I hate when I say yeah. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=900.26s)]
*  He'll say something and I go yeah. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=902.26s)]
*  They do have a singular brain. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=904.26s)]
*  Like I think that's what makes them so effective [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=906.26s)]
*  as like a voting block. It's like there's the rabbi, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=908.26s)]
*  the rabbi says this is what's going down, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=910.26s)]
*  and then they do it. Look how they dress. There's no like individualism. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=912.26s)]

*  or Miles' dick. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=998.26s)]
*  I'll be there. Only to get my dick sucked, not to perform. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1000.26s)]
*  Alright, thank you guys. Peace. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1002.26s)]
*  I also think part of the reason he won is maybe [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1004.26s)]
*  I don't want to argue with Friedberg, but like when you feel cheated by [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1006.26s)]
*  mainstream politicians, for lack of a better word, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1008.26s)]
*  the guys on the outside are going to start [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1010.26s)]
*  seeming a lot more appealing. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1012.26s)]
*  He seems so much more authentic than Cuomo has [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1014.26s)]
*  since COVID, at least. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1016.26s)]
*  He seems more authentic than me than Eric Adams seems. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1018.26s)]
*  He seems like he cares. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1020.26s)]
*  You can say not authentic or like... [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1022.26s)]
*  I don't feel like he's authentic. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1024.26s)]
*  Okay, fine, but it feels like he cares. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1026.26s)]
*  I think he has plans and ideas [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1028.26s)]
*  that appeal [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1030.26s)]
*  to the frustrations of New Yorkers [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1032.26s)]
*  where these other politicians like the Cuomos [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1034.26s)]
*  or whatever, feels like it's just going to be [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1036.26s)]
*  the same old same old [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1038.26s)]
*  that has put these New Yorkers in the position [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1040.26s)]
*  they are right now. They're suffering. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1042.26s)]
*  The only problem is like a lot of the plans that he has, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1044.26s)]
*  some of them, and this is why I want to talk with him, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1046.26s)]
*  and not on some gotcha shit, but like from my little research, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1048.26s)]
*  implementing them would be quite difficult. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1050.26s)]
*  Like for example, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1052.26s)]
*  to pay for all of his plans, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1054.26s)]
*  he wants like increased taxes [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1056.26s)]
*  by 2% on like the billionaires. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1058.26s)]
*  Sure, great idea. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1060.26s)]
*  The mayor can't do that. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1062.26s)]
*  You have to convince the assemblymen to do that. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1064.26s)]
*  Taxation, even in the New York City, is done in Albany, right? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1066.26s)]
*  Which he was working in the state assembly [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1068.26s)]
*  and he didn't do [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1070.26s)]
*  while he was there. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1072.26s)]
*  So how is he going to get it done [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1074.26s)]
*  now that he's mayor? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1076.26s)]
*  He was in the position to raise taxes before, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1078.26s)]
*  for four years, whatever it is, and it didn't happen. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1080.26s)]
*  Now he no longer has that authority to make that change. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1082.26s)]
*  How is that going to happen? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1084.26s)]
*  There's certain circumstances also like understanding [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1086.26s)]
*  like this like rent freeze. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1088.26s)]
*  I get it, I get it. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1090.26s)]
*  Rent is fucking crushing people, I get it 100%. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1092.26s)]
*  There's downstream effects of that [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1094.26s)]
*  that cause rental problems in New York City right now. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1096.26s)]
*  Now I'm sure there's other things to refute this. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1098.26s)]
*  And it has been done before. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1100.26s)]
*  It has. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1102.26s)]
*  The rent freezes have been done before, 100%. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1104.26s)]
*  But the downstream effects create these [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1106.26s)]
*  like what are called ghost apartments, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1108.26s)]
*  like zombie apartments. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1110.26s)]
*  So when you have a limitation [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1112.26s)]
*  in the ability to increase rent, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1114.26s)]
*  and I'm not making the argument for increasing rent, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1116.26s)]
*  and there's a bunch of fucking scumbag landlords out there, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1118.26s)]
*  don't get me wrong. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1120.26s)]
*  I actually love this idea of finding ways to make [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1122.26s)]
*  it more affordable for New York, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1124.26s)]
*  but I think the way you do that is by increasing production. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1126.26s)]
*  You basically create more supply. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1128.26s)]
*  And then that brings it all down. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1130.26s)]
*  But right now what you're going to do is [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1132.26s)]
*  he has plans to build, but building takes time. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1134.26s)]
*  You can't just erect a fucking skyscraper [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1136.26s)]
*  in a month or two like they used to do back in the day. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1138.26s)]
*  You have building codes and all this other fucking shit. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1140.26s)]
*  So you have this situation where [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1142.26s)]
*  if you're not allowed to build a building, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1144.26s)]
*  where if you're not allowed to increase rent, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1146.26s)]
*  it doesn't incentivize the people who own the building [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1148.26s)]
*  to renovate those apartments. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1150.26s)]
*  It actually incentivizes them to leave them vacant [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1152.26s)]
*  until hopefully one day they change. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1154.26s)]
*  So there's 100,000 units that are rent controlled [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1156.26s)]
*  in New York City that are sitting vacant right now. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1158.26s)]
*  100,000 because of this change. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1160.26s)]
*  So these are the types of down river effects [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1162.26s)]
*  that we need to think about. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1164.26s)]
*  Like yes rent freeze makes you feel awesome now [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1166.26s)]
*  and as a voter you go, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1168.26s)]
*  well I don't care about down river effects, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1170.26s)]
*  I don't care about down river effects. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1172.26s)]
*  So as a voter you go, well I don't care about downstream. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1174.26s)]
*  My life is difficult right now. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1176.26s)]
*  I need to know that I'm not spending more money [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1178.26s)]
*  every single year on rent. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1180.26s)]
*  I get that 100%, but do we create a problem? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1182.26s)]
*  Does this solution create a much bigger problem [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1184.26s)]
*  down the road, which it looks like it has, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1186.26s)]
*  whereas freeing up places to build [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1188.26s)]
*  so you increase supply will naturally drive down rent. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1190.26s)]
*  So I would have to do more research. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1192.26s)]
*  I just don't see how it would incentivize a landlord [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1194.26s)]
*  to not rent out the apartment [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1196.26s)]
*  because a rent freeze is a huge problem. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1198.26s)]
*  So I would have to do more research. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1200.26s)]
*  So I would have to rent out the apartment [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1202.26s)]
*  because a rent freeze is year to year. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1204.26s)]
*  It's not like a long term thing, it's not a forever thing. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1206.26s)]
*  What does that mean a rent freeze is year to year? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1208.26s)]
*  It's like every year they decide [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1210.26s)]
*  how much rent will go up, what percentage. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1212.26s)]
*  But that exists already. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1214.26s)]
*  Yeah, so he's just talking about [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1216.26s)]
*  hey rent freeze, that's temporary. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1218.26s)]
*  So for this year we're not raising rent. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1220.26s)]
*  Next year we'll revisit. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1222.26s)]
*  So it just temporarily helps people [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1224.26s)]
*  who are already pretty hard month to month with rent. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1226.26s)]
*  And then how would that help those people next year? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1230.26s)]
*  No, but that's the thing. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1234.26s)]
*  Temporarily you help people. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1236.26s)]
*  If you're really check to check, now okay, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1238.26s)]
*  I know for the next year my rent's not going to go up [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1240.26s)]
*  and maybe I can allocate some money, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1242.26s)]
*  put some money away, whatever the case is. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1244.26s)]
*  It just helps people who are starving right now. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1246.26s)]
*  It gives you like, you know when you're playing [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1248.26s)]
*  the car racing video game [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1250.26s)]
*  and you pass the checkpoint [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1252.26s)]
*  you get another 30 seconds or 40 seconds. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1254.26s)]
*  It gives you that. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1256.26s)]
*  It's not like a solution to the problem in New York City [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1258.26s)]
*  which is a lack of units, right? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1260.26s)]
*  And we have right now millions of square feet, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1262.26s)]
*  millions of square feet of office [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1264.26s)]
*  in midtown New York [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1266.26s)]
*  that is zoned for offices. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1268.26s)]
*  It's zoned for commercial. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1270.26s)]
*  If we can change that zoning [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1272.26s)]
*  and we can start making residential properties there, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1274.26s)]
*  yeah maybe it's not like the most amazing place to live [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1276.26s)]
*  but like honestly, who gives a fuck? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1278.26s)]
*  You're in Manhattan. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1280.26s)]
*  It would be an amazing place to live, right? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1282.26s)]
*  Sure, sure, like whatever. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1284.26s)]
*  Like I said, those things take time. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1286.26s)]
*  So in the meantime, I can freeze rent [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1288.26s)]
*  while creating more affordable housing. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1290.26s)]
*  Because you said he wants to build. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1292.26s)]
*  He wants to increase supply [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1294.26s)]
*  to match the demand. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1296.26s)]
*  But while I do that, year to year, here's a rent freeze. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1298.26s)]
*  That's fair. And I did see him say that [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1300.26s)]
*  he has ideas to build. I think that [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1302.26s)]
*  you don't even need to build. I think you just need to rezone a lot of these buildings. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1304.26s)]
*  Which would be even faster. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1306.26s)]
*  And then like months, we're talking about transition of months. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1308.26s)]
*  So many people are not working in these office spaces. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1310.26s)]
*  I'm not saying a lot of people are working from home. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1312.26s)]
*  Obviously people have gone back in. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1314.26s)]
*  But if there's still vacant offices, and we know the issue is supply. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1316.26s)]
*  Supply, supply. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1318.26s)]
*  You can't just put this like artificial cap. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1320.26s)]
*  An artificial cap, like you said, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1322.26s)]
*  maybe it lasts a year or two years. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1324.26s)]
*  But you're going to really affect the market. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1326.26s)]
*  And then you're not going to incentivize the renovation of these units [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1328.26s)]
*  and the upkeep of these units. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1330.26s)]
*  Now you want to have fucking slumlords? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1332.26s)]
*  That's going to be next level slumlords forever. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1334.26s)]
*  And also I'll say like there's a lot like [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1336.26s)]
*  we have friends growing up that had the [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1338.26s)]
*  I had both situations. I had friends that grew up [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1340.26s)]
*  in control departments and there were like [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1342.26s)]
*  people that were like hardworking, struggling. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1344.26s)]
*  And the landlords were doing everything they possibly [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1346.26s)]
*  could to get them kicked out of there. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1348.26s)]
*  Like piece of shit landlords. So we know those people exist 100%. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1350.26s)]
*  I had a friend, my boy Carlos. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1352.26s)]
*  Who ended up being a cop. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1354.26s)]
*  You guys have all met Carlos. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1356.26s)]
*  And like the landlords stopped accepting rent [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1358.26s)]
*  from the family. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1360.26s)]
*  So that they could eventually claim [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1362.26s)]
*  that they weren't paying rent. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1364.26s)]
*  So what his family did, they were smart enough. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1366.26s)]
*  They just started putting the rent in escrow. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1368.26s)]
*  And just kept it there. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1370.26s)]
*  And then they went to court and they ended up winning. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1372.26s)]
*  But like these fucking landlords will do anything to do it. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1374.26s)]
*  They'll buy some of these buildings. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1376.26s)]
*  Trying to buy them out. So we know that there's a lot [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1378.26s)]
*  of scumbag landlords. But there's also a lot of New Yorkers [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1380.26s)]
*  that have rent control departments. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1382.26s)]
*  And then they have a fucking place [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1384.26s)]
*  upstate. Like I know a buddy of mine. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1386.26s)]
*  He had a rent control apartment that was in Brooklyn [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1388.26s)]
*  Heights. And then he had a place upstate. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1390.26s)]
*  And that rent control apartment is [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1392.26s)]
*  not for you. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1394.26s)]
*  It's not for people that can afford another place. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1396.26s)]
*  And if the government knew that they had [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1398.26s)]
*  that other place, they would have kicked them out [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1400.26s)]
*  of that rent control apartment. So there are a lot [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1402.26s)]
*  of people with wealth that are taking advantage [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1404.26s)]
*  of this system as well. So it's not just [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1406.26s)]
*  these landlords. Yeah, but his solution [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1408.26s)]
*  is a fucking global [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1410.26s)]
*  intifada. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1412.26s)]
*  What else do you want? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1414.26s)]
*  It's a global intifada. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1416.26s)]
*  Here's how I know he's good is Dove don't even hate [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1418.26s)]
*  him. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1420.26s)]
*  That's when I was like, this guy's good. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1422.26s)]
*  That means Dove's in on some massage [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1424.26s)]
*  project. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1426.26s)]
*  Bring him into the studio. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1428.26s)]
*  You can talk to him and just see what he has to say. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1430.26s)]
*  If he passed Dove's sniff test [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1432.26s)]
*  test, he's good. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1434.26s)]
*  Al thinks he wins [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1436.26s)]
*  the general election. I don't think he wins [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1438.26s)]
*  the general election. I mean, listen, nobody can win the general [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1440.26s)]
*  election without coming on flagrant. So obviously [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1442.26s)]
*  if he wants to have the same [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1444.26s)]
*  outcome as to give you a thousand [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1446.26s)]
*  dollars, got the last socialist that [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1448.26s)]
*  the socialist, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1450.26s)]
*  the yang yang twin, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1452.26s)]
*  the yang yang twin was giving everybody [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1454.26s)]
*  a thousand bucks, right? He was gaining a lot [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1456.26s)]
*  of steam because American, you know, New [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1458.26s)]
*  Yorkers were struggling, right? So not we, but [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1460.26s)]
*  some, many are struggling. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1462.26s)]
*  So that seems really good. And then [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1464.26s)]
*  you play it safe and you know, you [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1466.26s)]
*  play prevent defense prevents you from winning. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1468.26s)]
*  He's gonna come on. So you [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1470.26s)]
*  have an open seat to come [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1472.26s)]
*  on. I have quite a few un-responded to [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1474.26s)]
*  text messages. He'll come on. But [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1476.26s)]
*  thousand dollar bet? Yeah, done. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1478.26s)]
*  No question. He's not gonna win. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1480.26s)]
*  Here's what I don't think people, dude, I think [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1482.26s)]
*  it was awesome watching the momentum. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1484.26s)]
*  He never had a target on his back. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1486.26s)]
*  He didn't run with a target on his back because nobody [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1488.26s)]
*  saw him as a real threat. So he just got [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1490.26s)]
*  to talk his shit, be spicy. Yeah, he wasn't [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1492.26s)]
*  a baby in Gaza. Like, why would he? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1494.26s)]
*  Why would he have a target on his back, dude? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1496.26s)]
*  Yo, stop that shit, Sheldon! [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1501.26s)]
*  Sheldon goes away alone. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1503.26s)]

*  Like, Spain, they're like, they're almost [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1871.26s)]

*  Like, they don't even really know what they are. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1875.26s)]
*  You know, it's everything's been so mixed [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1877.26s)]

*  they go on drugs and then they party all the way [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1917.26s)]
*  in the morning. And then the other side is just like [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1919.26s)]
*  older people with money who just want to chill. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1921.26s)]

*  been done in history. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1937.26s)]
*  I remember thinking about like D-Day [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1939.26s)]
*  when they like just dropped the door and like [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1941.26s)]

*  they don't even know what it's like to travel with a baby. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1947.26s)]
*  There's nothing more [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1949.26s)]
*  difficult than traveling with a baby. I mean [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1951.26s)]
*  that and I will stand by that for the rest of my life. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=1953.26s)]

*  assimilate because there's not [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2089.26s)]
*  much to assimilate to. Yeah. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2091.26s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? Like it's... [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2093.26s)]
*  They pop over Trump. It's like, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2095.26s)]
*  you don't have to teach them how to not work. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2097.26s)]
*  Jesus. Like you do with whom? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2099.26s)]

*  No, no, no, no. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2113.26s)]
*  But yeah, that's dude, one landmass. Europe, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2115.26s)]
*  Middle East, Asia, all one, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2117.26s)]
*  like, we don't have that issue. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2119.26s)]
*  They got real diversity over there. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2121.26s)]
*  They divide them. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2123.26s)]
*  But it is interesting that like [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2125.26s)]
*  people are having, I don't know, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2127.26s)]
*  maybe it's a reflection of economic downturn [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2129.26s)]
*  and people are blaming it on immigration [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2131.26s)]
*  and you're just looking for a scapegoat [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2133.26s)]
*  for your problems, right? Like, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2135.26s)]
*  maybe it's a little bit of everything. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2137.26s)]
*  But maybe [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2139.26s)]
*  there was a very ambitious like immigration [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2141.26s)]
*  policy. Like maybe people had too much [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2143.26s)]
*  hubris. Maybe they had too much confidence. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2145.26s)]
*  You know, it's like, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2147.26s)]
*  when you let few people in, they're [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2149.26s)]
*  forced to assimilate. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2151.26s)]
*  If you let big numbers in, there's really [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2153.26s)]
*  not a force. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2155.26s)]
*  I still have my community. You have your community [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2157.26s)]
*  so you don't really have to break free of that. Like you see [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2159.26s)]
*  that in New York a lot of times. Like you can go to Queens. There's [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2161.26s)]
*  areas of Queens where like people have lived their [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2163.26s)]
*  entire lives. They do not speak English. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2165.26s)]
*  Like they just speak Spanish. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2167.26s)]
*  You've been Colombian. Everybody in your community is Colombian, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2169.26s)]
*  etc. There's no pressure. If that [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2171.26s)]
*  community didn't exist, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2173.26s)]
*  now there's a real pressure. If you want to get a job, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2175.26s)]
*  you've got to speak the language, you've got to do these things. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2177.26s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2179.26s)]
*  Not to mention this is like an ancient [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2181.26s)]
*  issue. Talk to me. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2183.26s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like the Spanish battling [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2185.26s)]
*  North African [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2187.26s)]
*  Muslim people living in Spain. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2189.26s)]
*  There's cities [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2191.26s)]
*  in Spain called, I think it's called [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2193.26s)]
*  Matamoros. It literally [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2195.26s)]
*  means more killers. More killers, yeah. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2197.26s)]
*  There's whole cities named after like, yo, this is where we [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2199.26s)]
*  killed all the Muslims. And the cities [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2201.26s)]
*  has the same name today. Dude, go to the [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2203.26s)]
*  south of Spain. You're going to see [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2205.26s)]
*  tons of like these beautiful [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2207.26s)]
*  like repurposed mosques [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2209.26s)]
*  and stuff like that. Like the south of Spain [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2211.26s)]
*  is North Africa. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2213.26s)]
*  You're talking about like a boat ride, like nothing. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2215.26s)]
*  So you get why they're going there. Like yeah, dude, we're just taking it back. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2217.26s)]
*  Come back home. This Spain is [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2219.26s)]
*  promised to us. Come back home. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2221.26s)]
*  Dude, they had a, I mean, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2223.26s)]
*  they had the Jews that were living all throughout Spain. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2225.26s)]
*  And then I think that it was [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2227.26s)]
*  like 1491, they [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2229.26s)]
*  elected Zoram. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2231.26s)]
*  No, but they kicked the Jews out in 1491. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2235.26s)]
*  And then 1492, they came to America, got rich. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2241.26s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2243.26s)]
*  They went to find them. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2245.26s)]
*  They're like, where the fuck did they go? [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2247.26s)]
*  You didn't explain the [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2249.26s)]
*  fractional reserve banking before you left. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2251.26s)]
*  We need to keep one of y'all. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2253.26s)]
*  Excuse me, please. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2255.26s)]
*  Explain how you make the more money [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2257.26s)]
*  after all of the money. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2259.26s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2261.26s)]
*  You have $10 and how do you make it into $19 without making nine more dollars? [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2263.26s)]
*  Damn, dude. It really is that. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2269.26s)]
*  They got rid of the Jews and they're like, we just need to go steal money from someone else. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2271.26s)]
*  We can't make the magic. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2273.26s)]
*  We can't make Jew magic money. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2275.26s)]
*  Or they got rid of the Jews, kept all their money and they were like, let's build a navy. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2277.26s)]
*  That might have been another thing that happened, you know. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2281.26s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2283.26s)]
*  Who was telling me about this? [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2285.26s)]
*  Who the fuck was telling me about this? [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2287.26s)]
*  Oh, this [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2289.26s)]
*  When the Jews got kicked out of England, did you hear about this? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2291.26s)]
*  No. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2295.26s)]
*  They got kicked out of England for coin clipping. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2297.26s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2299.26s)]
*  Did you hear about this? [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2301.26s)]
*  So like what people do, why do they have the ridges on the end of coins? [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2303.26s)]
*  Right? Because before they had the ridges, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2305.26s)]
*  people would clip the end of the coins. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2307.26s)]
*  And they were made of the actual material. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2309.26s)]
*  They were actually made of like net throw. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2311.26s)]
*  So it wouldn't look different. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2313.26s)]
*  But you could get whatever. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2315.26s)]
*  And [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2317.26s)]
*  And then somebody asked them, they're like, well, didn't everybody just do that? [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2319.26s)]
*  And then somebody says, yeah, but they clip the hardest. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2323.26s)]
*  You know who fucking told me that? [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2333.26s)]
*  Zora Mondale. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2335.26s)]

*  Listen, you know we don't play around [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2421.26s)]
*  when it comes to WWE, okay? [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2423.26s)]
*  Obviously, I was, you know, sabotaged. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2425.26s)]
*  I was sabotaged at Madison Square Garden, my home, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2429.26s)]
*  by a Judas, someone who I thought was a friend. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2433.26s)]
*  You know, honestly, I could take legal action [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2435.26s)]
*  probably against him. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2437.26s)]
*  But sometimes you gotta take action in these streets. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2439.26s)]
*  Point is, Summer Slam is gonna be wild, okay? [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2441.26s)]

*  Let's get back to the show. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2502.26s)]
*  We need to talk about your vacation. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2503.26s)]
*  We need to talk about your vacation. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2504.26s)]
*  Oh, dude, we went to Paris. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2505.26s)]
*  Paris is fire. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2507.26s)]
*  You just gotta have someone to tell you where to eat. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2508.26s)]
*  Because if you go on your own, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2511.26s)]
*  we went off of Google Review, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2513.26s)]
*  and then my wife met with her friend [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2515.26s)]
*  and their husband was actually great. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2517.26s)]
*  We got into a fight with two people next to us. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2518.26s)]
*  It was a whole fucking thing. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2520.26s)]
*  At a restaurant? [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2521.26s)]
*  Dog. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2522.26s)]
*  Strangers? [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2523.26s)]
*  Yeah, so we're at this restaurant. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2524.26s)]
*  It's like a fucking rainforest cafe. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2526.26s)]
*  My wife's friend makes a reservation. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2528.26s)]
*  She goes, it has good Google reviews. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2530.26s)]
*  And I'm like, that's a problem. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2531.26s)]
*  In Paris, in Rome, don't trust Google reviews. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2533.26s)]
*  It's a bunch of fucking idiots from Toledo [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2535.26s)]
*  being like, this is the best food I've ever had. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2537.26s)]
*  You don't know shit. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2538.26s)]
*  We go there. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2539.26s)]
*  It's $12 tacos and then also dumplings [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2540.26s)]
*  and then also basmati masala rice. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2543.26s)]
*  It's just like every cuisine in one thing. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2545.26s)]
*  I've never met these people. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2547.26s)]
*  I can't be like, where the fuck did you bring this from? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2548.26s)]
*  Are you at the airport? [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2550.26s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2551.26s)]
*  But this is not a nice restaurant. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2552.26s)]
*  I can tell. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2553.26s)]
*  The next table, exactly. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2554.26s)]
*  Next table, we are this close together, right? [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2555.26s)]
*  My wife's friend is like a very bubbly person, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2557.26s)]
*  so she gets a little loud. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2560.26s)]
*  But we've been loud at diners many times. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2562.26s)]
*  I know what loud is. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2564.26s)]
*  It's just having fun. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2565.26s)]
*  Girl next to us goes, hey guys, guys, guys, [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2567.26s)]
*  can you quiet down, please? [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2569.26s)]
*  She feels really bad. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2571.26s)]
*  I'm like, we don't say anything. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2572.26s)]
*  It's like, all right, fine, whatever. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2573.26s)]
*  We keep eating. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2574.26s)]
*  Then I'm talking and she says it again. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2575.26s)]
*  She's actually saying it to this girl, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2577.26s)]
*  but I thought she was saying it to me. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2578.26s)]
*  She goes, guys, guys, guys, can you quiet down? [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2579.26s)]
*  I go, no, I'm not doing that. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2581.26s)]
*  And then I start talking again. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2582.26s)]
*  I'm not trying to be on these people's side. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2584.26s)]
*  Imagine you're trying to eat and then you're just hearing [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2586.26s)]
*  double, double, double, double, double, double, double, double. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2591.26s)]
*  Double, double, double, double, double, double, double. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2595.26s)]
*  Double, double, double. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2600.26s)]
*  Dude, my wife's friends are not even Indian. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2604.26s)]
*  Bullshit. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2606.26s)]
*  I'm lying. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2607.26s)]
*  I knew it. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2608.26s)]
*  You know, we stayed true. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2609.26s)]
*  Come on, bro. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2610.26s)]
*  We stayed true. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2611.26s)]
*  I already saw the Instagram. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2612.26s)]
*  I peeped. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2613.26s)]
*  I saw the Instagram story. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2614.26s)]
*  I peeped it already. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2615.26s)]
*  I was ready. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2616.26s)]
*  OK, tell me. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2617.26s)]
*  So OK. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2618.26s)]
*  So second time, I'm like, we're just going to shut this down. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2619.26s)]
*  I go, we're not doing that. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2621.26s)]
*  And then I start talking. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2622.26s)]
*  And then she starts yelling, putting her hand close to my face. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2623.26s)]
*  Then my wife goes, don't talk to my husband like that. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2626.26s)]
*  Don't put your hand on my husband's face. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2629.26s)]
*  And I'm like, now we got a thing. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2631.26s)]
*  I know this is not going down from here. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2633.26s)]
*  Does she have a man with her? [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2635.26s)]
*  No, it's another woman. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2636.26s)]
*  Two friends. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2638.26s)]
*  You're good. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2639.26s)]
*  They're French or American? [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2640.26s)]
*  They're French. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2641.26s)]
*  OK. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2642.26s)]
*  But you're here at the fucking Rainforest Cafe. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2643.26s)]
*  The waitress is coming over in a printed t-shirt as a work uniform with a lizard on it. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2644.26s)]
*  This is not a nice place. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2648.26s)]
*  So my point is like, now we're all kind of, and I'm like, look, you're at a place with [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2649.26s)]
*  12 euro tacos. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2653.26s)]
*  Don't pretend this is going to be quiet. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2654.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2655.26s)]
*  Like you need to go somewhere else. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2656.26s)]
*  If you want a nice quiet meal, y'all can go spend money. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2657.26s)]
*  She starts yelling back and forth. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2659.26s)]
*  Immigration doesn't work, guys. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2661.26s)]
*  She then, this fucking, this is like, this is some true Karen shit. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2662.26s)]
*  She hits me, pokes me hard. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2666.26s)]
*  My wife goes, I'll slap the shit out of you, bitch. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2668.26s)]
*  Now it's a thing. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2671.26s)]
*  Now our waitress comes over, this dumpy looking bitch. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2673.26s)]
*  And she's like, what's going on? [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2676.26s)]
*  The other guy stands up, like, yo, she just hit our friend. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2678.26s)]
*  And then the lady goes, what did he do? [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2681.26s)]
*  And they go, they said we were being loud. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2685.26s)]
*  And the waitress goes, you were being kind of loud. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2687.26s)]
*  And I was like, this is crazy. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2689.26s)]
*  I loved it. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2691.26s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2692.26s)]
*  But I loved it. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2693.26s)]
*  So the friend goes, get the manager over here. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2694.26s)]
*  This lady is still screaming at me, still like touching me. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2697.26s)]
*  I'm like, do not fucking touch me. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2700.26s)]
*  My wife is going nuts. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2701.26s)]
*  We can step outside. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2702.26s)]
*  This is a whole thing. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2703.26s)]
*  Then she starts staring down this other poor girl who was just being loud, but hasn't said [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2704.26s)]
*  anything this whole time. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2709.26s)]
*  She starts staring her down. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2710.26s)]
*  Her husband is like, is this bitch looking at my wife? [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2711.26s)]
*  He gets in her line of sight like this. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2713.26s)]
*  Full stare down. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2715.26s)]
*  Manager comes over and there's an empty table. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2716.26s)]
*  So my friend who's pretty calm, the husband is like, just tell them to move down a table. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2719.26s)]
*  You can't hit somebody. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2723.26s)]
*  There's an empty table. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2724.26s)]
*  They can move down one. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2725.26s)]
*  And then the manager talks to them. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2726.26s)]
*  He comes over and he goes, I'm going to be honest. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2728.26s)]
*  You're right. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2730.26s)]
*  She's fucking crazy. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2731.26s)]
*  We're going to move them down a table. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2732.26s)]
*  Everything is cool. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2734.26s)]
*  The manager is a minority. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2735.26s)]
*  So he's not going to just, this white lady is obviously going to side with this. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2736.26s)]
*  But the white French people. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2738.26s)]
*  But the manager was like, this lady is fucking nuts. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2739.26s)]
*  Oh dude, also. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2742.26s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2743.26s)]
*  She's the only type of French there is. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2744.26s)]
*  I didn't know. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2747.26s)]
*  Miles, do you think the black people would be complaining about how loud that table is next to them? [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2750.26s)]
*  I didn't put a color to them at all. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2755.26s)]
*  Miles is a racist ass. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2758.26s)]
*  Yeah, I was so racist. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2759.26s)]
*  He was like, you guys are eating in a jungle. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2760.26s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2762.26s)]
*  I didn't put any color to them. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2764.26s)]
*  And then he said they were white. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2765.26s)]
*  And I was like, oh, they are white. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2766.26s)]
*  No, Miles is pictured all this. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2767.26s)]
*  He's like, I know, I know what it is. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2768.26s)]
*  I just didn't think about it. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2771.26s)]
*  Hey, Miles. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2772.26s)]
*  Hey, Miles. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2773.26s)]
*  Too progressive, bro. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2774.26s)]
*  You saw the French soccer team. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2776.26s)]
*  You're like, no, they're black. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2777.26s)]
*  French people are all black, obviously. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2778.26s)]
*  I just didn't even think of their color. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2779.26s)]
*  You didn't think of their colors? [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2781.26s)]
*  I didn't even think I had to explain. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2783.26s)]
*  She's complaining about noise. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2785.26s)]
*  Who does that? [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2787.26s)]
*  French people. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2788.26s)]
*  I just, like, it just seemed very European. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2789.26s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2791.26s)]
*  Anyway, keep going. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2792.26s)]
*  So what's the change? [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2793.26s)]
*  Do you think Alexandra Hamilton is actually being racist? [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2794.26s)]
*  Do you think Alexandra Hamilton is actually black? [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2796.26s)]
*  I need to know. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2797.26s)]
*  I feel like you saw this. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2798.26s)]
*  No, he wasn't. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2799.26s)]
*  So eventually they moved down. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2800.26s)]
*  Everything was cool. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2801.26s)]
*  But the craziest thing is while she's complaining and then my friend is like, yo, she hit my [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2802.26s)]
*  friend, whatever. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2807.26s)]
*  Her friend goes, he hit her first. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2808.26s)]
*  I said, are you, I go, are you fucking mine, bitch? [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2810.26s)]
*  I'll get arrested if you say that. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2812.26s)]
*  And she just goes, you're right. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2813.26s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2815.26s)]
*  And it was like, that's an insane thing to go out there. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2816.26s)]
*  And then just be like, you're right, my bad. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2819.26s)]
*  No, I love these two women. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2821.26s)]
*  She pumped the shit out of you. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2823.26s)]
*  You didn't do shit. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2828.26s)]
*  What I'm going to do? [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2829.26s)]
*  I'm going to knock her out? [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2830.26s)]
*  Knock that French bitch out. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2831.26s)]
*  They're practically men. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2833.26s)]
*  They don't shave and shit. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2834.26s)]
*  Fuck her. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2835.26s)]
*  You hit her with a halter and she's like, son, I really wanted to. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2836.26s)]
*  I really wanted to. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2842.26s)]
*  Your wife should have smacked her shit out that day. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2843.26s)]
*  She said she'll do it and then she kept touching you. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2846.26s)]
*  She's freaking out, dude. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2848.26s)]
*  My wife freaking out. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2849.26s)]

*  You don't get arrested here. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2853.26s)]
*  We just got a Birkin. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2854.26s)]

*  Sit the fuck down. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2856.26s)]
*  But as soon as she said, don't talk to my husband like that, I was like, here we go. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2857.26s)]

*  They ended up moving down. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2862.26s)]
*  And then I was just intentionally louder for the rest of the meal. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2863.26s)]

*  And they come through the door. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2877.26s)]
*  And they come through meal because they had to sit next to fucking Hindu stand. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2879.26s)]

*  Y'all should have brought out a hookah in the middle of the dinner. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2888.26s)]
*  Put your own hookah on the table. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2891.26s)]
*  Start hitting it, blowing into her face. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2893.26s)]
*  That's how you teach them a lesson about a global. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2895.26s)]
*  What they call the global globalist. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=2897.26s)]

*  They are so frustrated that them objectifying guys, dicks didn't drive us crazy. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3238.26s)]
*  But we looked at it as a permission slip. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3243.26s)]
*  So now the next day we're like, we got to look at the chimichangas. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3245.26s)]
*  The chimichangas are titty, right? [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3248.26s)]
*  Look at these French woman's dicks. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3250.26s)]
*  French dicks on tits. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3252.26s)]
*  And let me tell you, there was a lot of tits and it was about 15 minutes of that. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3254.26s)]
*  And then my wife shut that shit down. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3258.26s)]
*  Hit me with the, I feel rejected. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3260.26s)]
*  Like you don't love me. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3263.26s)]
*  That kind of shit, just because I'm looking at some gigantic girl's tits. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3265.26s)]
*  That's silly. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3268.26s)]
*  I love you so much. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3270.26s)]
*  You're just being objective. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3272.26s)]
*  When you go to a museum, you look at one painting. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3273.26s)]
*  No. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3275.26s)]
*  No. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3276.26s)]
*  You don't touch the paintings. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3277.26s)]
*  You can't steal them. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3279.26s)]
*  You can't touch them. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3280.26s)]
*  You can't take them with you. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3281.26s)]
*  But you sit in front of them and you jerk off all over. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3282.26s)]
*  That's why they have the plastic. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3285.26s)]
*  That's how they make the Jackson Pollock. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3286.26s)]
*  That's where it came from. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3288.26s)]
*  There's Impressionist art and then Mahajanak. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3289.26s)]
*  You're like a PETA protester, dude. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3293.26s)]
*  That's a great PETA protester. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3296.26s)]
*  Just fucking jerk off. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3298.26s)]
*  That is a good PETA protester. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3299.26s)]
*  Why is there white paint all over this painting, dude? [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3301.26s)]
*  That is fucking smart. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3303.26s)]
*  Bust on the Mona Lisa's face. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3306.26s)]
*  Not in Mona Lisa. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3308.26s)]
*  The model's walking down the runway. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3309.26s)]
*  They're wearing the fur. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3311.26s)]
*  You start jerking off on them. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3313.26s)]
*  Oh, you want animal products? [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3315.26s)]
*  This seems like a horrible thing. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3319.26s)]
*  Maybe we do need a Muslim rule. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3321.26s)]
*  Maybe we've gone too far. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3323.26s)]
*  Maybe we do need to expand the caliphate. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3325.26s)]
*  Maybe we need, on a global intifada, what is the meant to be? [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3327.26s)]
*  Regional intifada. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3330.26s)]
*  Regional, yeah. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3331.26s)]
*  Block by block intifada. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3332.26s)]
*  Block by block intifada. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3334.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3336.26s)]
*  Stop and frisk intifada. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3337.26s)]
*  What did you do on vacation? [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3338.26s)]
*  No vacation. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3339.26s)]
*  I went to Portland for shows and then I went to a prison with jelly roll. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3340.26s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3343.26s)]
*  You texted the group chat this yesterday. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3344.26s)]
*  I was like, what the fuck is Mark up to? [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3346.26s)]
*  I was in Portland. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3348.26s)]
*  Did you perform? [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3349.26s)]
*  He asked me to. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3350.26s)]
*  He asked me. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3351.26s)]
*  So I'm in Portland. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3352.26s)]
*  He just messaged me. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3353.26s)]
*  He's like, oh, blah, blah. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3354.26s)]
*  I'm in Portland. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3355.26s)]
*  I was like, let's fucking go. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3356.26s)]
*  So I went to the Portland Trailblazers training facility. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3357.26s)]
*  I watched them play basketball. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3359.26s)]
*  He didn't join in? [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3360.26s)]
*  No, I was like, you guys got it. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3361.26s)]
*  You guys can keep it up. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3362.26s)]
*  And Jelly Roll is just an angel of a human being. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3363.26s)]
*  I love him so much. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3366.26s)]
*  He's the best. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3367.26s)]
*  He's also so skinny now. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3368.26s)]
*  Yeah, he's losing. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3369.26s)]
*  Every time I see him, he's just half of the Jelly Roll. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3370.26s)]
*  He's not even a full Jelly Roll. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3373.26s)]
*  He looks amazing. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3374.26s)]
*  That was about the prison right now. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3375.26s)]
*  He goes, hey, you want to go to the prison tomorrow? [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3378.26s)]
*  I go, yeah, let's do it. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3379.26s)]
*  And he goes, do you want to do five minutes? [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3380.26s)]
*  I was like, nah, I'd rather not. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3381.26s)]
*  And he's like, no, no, you've got to do it. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3382.26s)]
*  Just please. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3383.26s)]
*  And so we show up. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3384.26s)]
*  I'm going through the set. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3385.26s)]
*  I'm like, what do I do? [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3386.26s)]
*  I was like, oh, fuck. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3387.26s)]
*  My opening would just be like, look, guys, I'm not going to pander to you motherfuckers. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3388.26s)]
*  With that being said, I think you're all innocent. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3393.26s)]
*  OK, that was just going to be an opening joke. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3394.26s)]
*  And so we show up at the thing. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3396.26s)]
*  Immediately, they're like, you can't wear your shorts. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3397.26s)]
*  You look like a prisoner. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3399.26s)]
*  I was like, what? [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3400.26s)]
*  Like, yeah, you're wearing blue denim shorts. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3401.26s)]
*  That's what all the prisoners wear. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3402.26s)]
*  So I was like, oh, fuck. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3404.26s)]
*  So I put on different pants. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3405.26s)]
*  And then we go inside. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3406.26s)]
*  And then they're like, the union boss said that they can't do comedy, only music. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3407.26s)]
*  And I was like, whew. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3410.26s)]
*  So then I just stood there. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3411.26s)]
*  The prison is like 500 dudes deep. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3412.26s)]
*  This is like the big event of the year. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3414.26s)]
*  They're so excited. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3415.26s)]
*  A lot of these guys are in there for life. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3416.26s)]
*  A lot of these guys were on death row for like 30 years. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3417.26s)]
*  And then they recently commuted their sentences, abandoned death row in Oregon. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3420.26s)]
*  I'm not doing that. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3423.26s)]
*  So now it's me and just a bunch of dudes. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3424.26s)]
*  They are unfortunate. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3426.26s)]
*  You've got nothing to lose. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3427.26s)]
*  Unfortunately, the nicest guys ever. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3428.26s)]
*  Yeah, they are. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3430.26s)]
*  I've never seen a pretty bitch in a prison like that. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3432.26s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3435.26s)]
*  You come with those locks? [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3436.26s)]
*  Those guys were stroking good that night. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3438.26s)]
*  Yeah, they were going to start protesting all over him. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3440.26s)]
*  They were good. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3442.26s)]
*  They were phenomenal. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3443.26s)]
*  They were phenomenally nice. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3445.26s)]
*  Jelly's on stage. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3446.26s)]
*  I'm just chatting with these dudes. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3447.26s)]
*  I didn't realize. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3448.26s)]
*  There was no security around you? [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3449.26s)]
*  No, there were just eight of these guys. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3450.26s)]
*  I'm just hanging in the mosh with all the prisoners. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3452.26s)]
*  They're so nice. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3454.26s)]
*  And Jelly starts singing. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3455.26s)]
*  He hit save me. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3456.26s)]
*  The whole yard is singing save me together. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3457.26s)]
*  I'm crying. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3459.26s)]
*  Everyone's crying. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3460.26s)]
*  It's me and a bunch of prisoners just all sobbing and crying. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3461.26s)]
*  I did whatever the opposite of scared straight is. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3463.26s)]
*  I went in there and I was like, I could do this for a while. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3465.26s)]
*  These guys are pretty cool, dude. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3467.26s)]
*  So I just hung in there. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3469.26s)]
*  I cried like a baby and I left. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3470.26s)]
*  And Jelly was like, all right, papa, that's it. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3472.26s)]
*  And then they took a private jet and flew off. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3474.26s)]
*  That was like the whole day. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3476.26s)]
*  I just got sunburned with a bunch of prisoners talking about their life stories and crying. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3477.26s)]
*  It was outside. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3481.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3482.26s)]
*  Damn. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3483.26s)]
*  You could have died, bro. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3484.26s)]
*  They could have killed you. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3485.26s)]
*  Yeah, probably. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3486.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3487.26s)]
*  Like nothing to lose. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3488.26s)]
*  You got life, nothing to lose. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3489.26s)]
*  And you walk in, you know. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3490.26s)]
*  Why would they kill him? [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3491.26s)]
*  Well, I would say a lot of these guys with lives, they got, they're in their little program. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3492.26s)]
*  They got the lifers program where they take care of the prison. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3496.26s)]
*  They run the whole yard. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3498.26s)]
*  They set up the whole event themselves and they organize everything internally, just give [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3499.26s)]
*  the information over to the warden. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3502.26s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, we're going to do this is how we organize it. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3504.26s)]
*  So they got it's probably good. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3506.26s)]
*  Keep them busy. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3507.26s)]
*  They got a bunch of autonomy. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3508.26s)]
*  They got like a Zen garden. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3509.26s)]
*  They got a healing garden is all the stuff. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3510.26s)]
*  Anybody try to get a little bit of a sense of what they're doing. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3511.26s)]
*  They had like this beautiful garden. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3513.26s)]
*  It was immaculate. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3514.26s)]
*  Banzai? [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3515.26s)]
*  All sorts of shit. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3516.26s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3517.26s)]
*  Better than regular people living in Portland. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3518.26s)]
*  Hold on, hold on one second. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3519.26s)]
*  Because I've recently become very interested in Banzai. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3520.26s)]
*  How disconcerting is this? [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3521.26s)]
*  He's a green thumb now. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3522.26s)]
*  He texted me, son, I think I'm getting into Banzai. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3523.26s)]
*  I was like, are you okay, dude? [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3524.26s)]
*  Son, I needed some relaxation, bro. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3525.26s)]
*  I'm stressed. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3526.26s)]
*  I'm traveling with a baby. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3527.26s)]
*  And then all of a sudden a Banzai video came up on my feed. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3528.26s)]
*  I'm like, these are the most majestic plants in the world. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3529.26s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to go to the forest. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3530.26s)]
*  I'm going to go to the forest. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3531.26s)]
*  I'm going to go to the forest. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3532.26s)]
*  I'm having a midlife crisis, but like not in the way where I buy like crazy cars and [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3534.26s)]
*  stuff. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3556.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3557.26s)]
*  You know, it's in the way where I think about purchasing a Banzai and then curating it. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3558.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3561.26s)]
*  I'm trying to find a way to make the trunk really thick. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3562.26s)]
*  Brooklyn Botanical Garden, they have 300 year old Banzais. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3563.26s)]
*  I know. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3566.26s)]
*  You can go see them. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3567.26s)]
*  I know all of them. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3568.26s)]
*  I know all of them by name. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3569.26s)]
*  I know how much money they are and I know how long they've been growing them. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3570.26s)]
*  These things, for generations they grow these things. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3572.26s)]
*  This guy once saw one Spanish cock and he was like, I need a Banzai. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3574.26s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3577.26s)]
*  He texted me that too like that. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3578.26s)]
*  He didn't sell me. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3579.26s)]
*  He's like, oh, it's living art. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3580.26s)]
*  Oh, now I got it. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3581.26s)]
*  Can I tell you one thing about the Banzai? [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3582.26s)]
*  If trees can feel things. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3585.26s)]
*  Son, I said the same. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3588.26s)]
*  He used to be in New York. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3589.26s)]
*  What the fuck has he turned into? [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3590.26s)]
*  We have to prepare for a new New York. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3591.26s)]
*  If trees feel like Ferngully, like they actually have feelings, this is the most cruel thing [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3596.26s)]
*  that's ever existed in America. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3602.26s)]
*  If trees have feelings, the Japanese should be bombed again and again and again and again. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3604.26s)]
*  It's a miniature of Nanking. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3610.26s)]
*  Every day they peel the skin off of them. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3612.26s)]
*  They cut the limbs. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3615.26s)]
*  They put them in pots that are way too small for their size. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3617.26s)]
*  But seeing something small that looks ancient, like a midget with a beard, is exciting. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3622.26s)]
*  You look at it and you're entranced by it. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3628.26s)]
*  There's wisdom in there. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3631.26s)]
*  I'm not entranced by it. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3632.26s)]
*  Can I just take you on a Banzai journey? [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3633.26s)]
*  Yes. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3635.26s)]
*  Because they have it in the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3636.26s)]
*  They have a Banzai section we can go. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3638.26s)]
*  I would love to take you and I'd love to help you relax there. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3639.26s)]
*  I think you'll have the best sleep you've ever had in your life. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3643.26s)]
*  I am willing to do this. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3645.26s)]
*  You do me a favor, on the way there, on the way back, let's have some therapy sessions, you and me. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3647.26s)]
*  I would love therapy. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3652.26s)]
*  Because I don't think everything is okay. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3653.26s)]
*  I need therapy. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3654.26s)]
*  I need to talk about a lot of issues. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3655.26s)]
*  But I'm going to put it away to the side and I'm going to get into Banzai instead. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3657.26s)]
*  I'm going to do what men do. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3661.26s)]
*  I'm not going to confirm my problems. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3663.26s)]
*  How many things can you f-paddle Banzai? [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3665.26s)]
*  At what point do you just be like... [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3666.26s)]
*  It's never enough! [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3667.26s)]
*  Let's just walk through it. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3668.26s)]
*  It's never enough! [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3670.26s)]
*  This one might be the one, dude. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3671.26s)]
*  It might be the one. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3672.26s)]
*  I think it's the one. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3673.26s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3674.26s)]
*  I think this will fix it. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3675.26s)]
*  It's so beautiful, these Banzai trees. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3676.26s)]
*  Not all of them. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3677.26s)]
*  I prefer a pine, like a Japanese pine. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3678.26s)]
*  But, yeah. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3679.26s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3680.26s)]
*  And can we... [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3681.26s)]
*  Was that funny to you? [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3682.26s)]
*  Yes. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3683.26s)]
*  Was that funny? [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3684.26s)]
*  It's horrifying to me, actually. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3685.26s)]
*  Why don't you bring one Banzai up and see if it doesn't relax every motherfucker on this [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3686.26s)]
*  couch right now. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3689.26s)]
*  Bring up one f-cking Banzai tree. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3690.26s)]
*  Dude, I think that has some of these... [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3692.26s)]
*  That one right there. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3693.26s)]
*  Yep. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3694.26s)]
*  Oh, look at that. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3695.26s)]
*  Look at the root structure. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3696.26s)]
*  Look how thick those trunks are. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3698.26s)]
*  Do you know how difficult it is to get those trunks? [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3701.26s)]
*  You wire the branches, force them to grow in certain ways, then you clip the wires. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3703.26s)]
*  Alex. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3708.26s)]
*  Yo, pray for shelves, bro. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3709.26s)]
*  Son. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3710.26s)]
*  This motherfucker's going through some... [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3711.26s)]
*  I can't have interest. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3712.26s)]
*  I can't have interest. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3713.26s)]
*  You got enough. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3714.26s)]
*  You got enough. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3715.26s)]
*  You got a baby. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3716.26s)]
*  What are my interests? [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3717.26s)]
*  I have a baby. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3718.26s)]
*  I spend every waking moment I can avoiding her. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3719.26s)]
*  I swear to God, he was texting me this, and I was like... [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3721.26s)]
*  To my wife, I was like, dude, I think Chulson's help. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3726.26s)]
*  I need to be there for him. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3728.26s)]
*  I have to find out who I can text. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3729.26s)]
*  I texted to Uyeda, and he's like, dude, all I want to do is retire and do bonsai. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3730.26s)]
*  That's because he's Japanese, dog fucking thing. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3736.26s)]
*  He's from the phone, dude. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3738.26s)]
*  He's going back home. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3739.26s)]
*  Of course he feels that way. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3740.26s)]
*  Yeah, but can I appreciate other cultures, and can I appreciate what they've given us? [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3742.26s)]
*  Think about bonsai like you guys think about cows or whatever. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3746.26s)]
*  You embrace them, you let them live, you don't just chop them apart and use them. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3749.26s)]
*  But they treat them cruelly, like you said. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3753.26s)]
*  Well, it depends. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3755.26s)]
*  You also starved them, so maybe... [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3756.26s)]
*  No, we don't. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3758.26s)]
*  Have you ever seen a cow in India? [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3759.26s)]
*  Have you seen a person in India? [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3760.26s)]
*  Yes, I have. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3762.26s)]
*  They don't give food sometimes. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3763.26s)]
*  Yeah, it is true. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3764.26s)]
*  Look how beautiful that tree is. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3766.26s)]
*  Jesus, so balanced. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3768.26s)]
*  I don't get it. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3769.26s)]
*  Wind swept. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3770.26s)]
*  See, imagine if you were just in prison, this is what you could do all day. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3771.26s)]
*  Right? [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3775.26s)]
*  I thought about it. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3776.26s)]
*  You listen to Jelly Roll, you work on your bonsai, it's pretty sick. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3777.26s)]
*  I thought about it, but then I don't get to see my little chicken. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3779.26s)]
*  No, you get visitation. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3782.26s)]
*  Yeah, but not enough. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3783.26s)]
*  It's once a day. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3785.26s)]
*  It's perfect. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3786.26s)]
*  Oh, look at them. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3787.26s)]
*  Look at how majestic they are. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3788.26s)]
*  Look at the root structure. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3790.26s)]
*  Dude, when Schultz retires, it's going to be so funny how much he changes. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3791.26s)]
*  Do oldest bonsai ever. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3794.26s)]
*  Let me tell you how quickly, the second I... [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3795.26s)]
*  There is like an adult paddle tour that I can be competitive at. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3797.26s)]
*  The XFL paddle. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3801.26s)]
*  If they have that, it's over. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3802.26s)]
*  It's over, I'm retiring. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3805.26s)]
*  Okay. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3807.26s)]
*  He's going to grow his hair out. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3808.26s)]
*  You can just start this, right? [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3809.26s)]
*  He's going to vote for Mondani. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3810.26s)]
*  It's going to be a whole... [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3811.26s)]
*  He's going to be very zen once he's done. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3812.26s)]
*  I cannot wait to vote for Mondani and then move to Florida. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3813.26s)]
*  I cannot wait to do this. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3817.26s)]
*  I don't love that one. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3820.26s)]
*  Scroll down, scroll down. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3822.26s)]
*  Oh, God. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3823.26s)]
*  What's the oldest one? [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3824.26s)]
*  Oh, look at it. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3826.26s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3827.26s)]
*  Look at that root structure. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3829.26s)]
*  Those guys have been tending it for thousands of years. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3830.26s)]
*  That's cool. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3832.26s)]
*  The oldest one is like a few hundred years old. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3833.26s)]
*  This one's estimated to be a thousand. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3835.26s)]
*  I don't believe it. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3837.26s)]
*  I think there was one in Hawaii. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3838.26s)]
*  There was one in Maui, I think. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3840.26s)]
*  And what's that place? [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3842.26s)]
*  Lanai or whatever? [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3843.26s)]
*  I think there was one like really old bonsai tree. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3844.26s)]
*  Yeah, Lanai. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3846.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3847.26s)]
*  Beautiful. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3848.26s)]
*  I mean, look at that. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3849.26s)]
*  These have been passed down for generations. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3850.26s)]
*  You have to upkeep these things. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3853.26s)]
*  How big is that thing? [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3854.26s)]
*  Probably a couple feet. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3855.26s)]
*  They do make bigger ones. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3858.26s)]
*  Those are a little bit more impressive, [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3859.26s)]
*  but they're not as special, some might say. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3860.26s)]
*  You're going to pass this down? [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3863.26s)]
*  No. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3865.26s)]
*  You're going to die with it? [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3866.26s)]
*  No, I'm going to free it like Jefferson did with his slaves or whatever. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3867.26s)]
*  Once I die, the bonsai can then go be a tree as it wants. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3871.26s)]
*  But I'm going to make it a little tic-a-poodle for this. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3875.26s)]
*  You have a bonsai. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3878.26s)]
*  Your little dog, that's a bonsai. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3879.26s)]
*  You realize we like little things, right? [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3881.26s)]
*  So they've mutated the dog. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3883.26s)]
*  You have a bonsai that sits and shits and pees. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3885.26s)]
*  I'll just get one that doesn't sit and shit and pee. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3888.26s)]
*  But that don't cuddle with you. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3890.26s)]
*  It says you. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3891.26s)]
*  It says you. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3892.26s)]
*  Not everybody needs cuddles. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3893.26s)]
*  Not everybody needs that. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3894.26s)]
*  Sometimes you just want to look at something beautiful. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3895.26s)]
*  There's a wonderful lesson in here. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3897.26s)]
*  I'm worried about them. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3900.26s)]
*  You're going to pass this on to your family. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3901.26s)]
*  They're going to be like, oh, all right. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3902.26s)]
*  Listen, I do think you should be worried about me, but outside of that, look at the juniper. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3903.26s)]
*  I think that juniper. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3908.26s)]
*  Go down, scroll down. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3909.26s)]
*  I think the juniper is going to be beautiful. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3910.26s)]
*  Oh, I hate it. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3912.26s)]
*  Keep going. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3913.26s)]
*  I like that. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3914.26s)]
*  That's something modern, dude. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3915.26s)]
*  Keep going, keep going, keep going. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3916.26s)]
*  The other way, the other way, the other way, the other way, the other way. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3917.26s)]
*  That's number one. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3920.26s)]
*  We got to number one. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3921.26s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3922.26s)]
*  Just majestic. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3923.26s)]
*  Thousand years old. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3924.26s)]
*  Truly majestic. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3925.26s)]
*  That root structure, where does it go? [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3926.26s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3928.26s)]
*  500, Al. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3929.26s)]
*  Yes. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3930.26s)]
*  How many generations? [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3931.26s)]
*  One Japanese generation. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3932.26s)]
*  One Japanese guy, his 500 years old stuff. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3933.26s)]
*  Okay, so you went to prison and then you did some shows in Portland. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3934.26s)]
*  Yeah, it was wonderful. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3935.26s)]
*  But they were fun. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3936.26s)]
*  Oh, they were great. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3937.26s)]
*  Portland actually has great comedy scene. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3938.26s)]
*  Fantastic. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3939.26s)]
*  Every type of mix of person you can imagine. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3940.26s)]
*  You have the non-gendered native barista, and then there's just a Mexican magi guy just [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3941.26s)]
*  sitting hand in hand. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3942.26s)]
*  It was beautiful. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3943.26s)]
*  No, it was great. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3944.26s)]
*  A lot of times, these super liberal cities, they're like, oh, I'm going to go to the [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=3945.26s)]

*  kid? [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4175.9400000000005s)]
*  Am I getting his name right? [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4176.9400000000005s)]
*  Joshua Van. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4177.9400000000005s)]
*  Joshua Van. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4178.9400000000005s)]
*  Sorry Joshua, sorry Joshua. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4179.9400000000005s)]
*  What do you think about him? [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4180.9400000000005s)]
*  That was like the first proper fight that I watched. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4181.9400000000005s)]
*  I heard good things and then I seen a couple highlights. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4184.66s)]
*  I'm like, oh man, this guy's good. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4186.860000000001s)]
*  Did you watch him three weeks ago when he fought? [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4187.860000000001s)]
*  I ended up seeing the highlights of that. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4190.06s)]
*  But then I knew how good Roy Valle is. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4191.46s)]
*  But then I end up picking Joshua Van just because I'm just like, man, just momentum [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4194.06s)]
*  right now, just on a tear. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4198.46s)]
*  I'm like, I think he's going to get it done. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4200.1s)]
*  You know, big, big week, international fight week. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4202.18s)]
*  He'll just turn it on and oh man, did they turn that on. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4204.660000000001s)]
*  How was that, mate? [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4207.740000000001s)]
*  That was, I reckon that's probably the best fight I've ever seen. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4208.740000000001s)]
*  Dude, it was unbelievable. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4210.26s)]
*  I mean, if you haven't seen it, like I recommend watching it because, and I'm excited to talk [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4211.26s)]
*  to you about it specifically because what I thought that he did so well, and this is [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4215.660000000001s)]
*  had to do well in your career is like timing, timing, timing. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4220.46s)]
*  He's not a tall guy. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4225.42s)]
*  He doesn't have long arms. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4226.42s)]
*  Like you actually have a lot of reach. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4227.42s)]
*  I think that's what people don't realize about you. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4229.18s)]
*  Yeah, we'll get back to that. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4230.9800000000005s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4233.06s)]
*  But like his ability to counter, first of all, almost the entire fight was just striking [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4234.38s)]
*  and very few kicks thrown. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4240.38s)]
*  And it was this like impeccable timing and counters that he was doing. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4242.02s)]
*  And Roy Vaughan is long, kind of tall for the division. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4245.46s)]
*  Like quick jab, but like what were you seeing with this van kit? [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4249.26s)]
*  That's why I can't wait to watch it back. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4254.9800000000005s)]
*  Like strategically. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4256.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, well, yeah, just watch it on like a TV, you know, and they'll give you all the [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4257.9800000000005s)]
*  better camera angles. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4261.42s)]
*  But exactly what you were saying, a just real van, especially early, he was like, he was [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4262.66s)]
*  just waiting, he's patient. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4266.54s)]
*  And Roy Vaughan was using that jab, doing that very nicely. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4269.82s)]
*  And they're just waiting for the right time to go. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4272.54s)]
*  Or when he did decide to go first, he was really good at still bridging the gap. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4275.94s)]
*  As you were saying, he's short, but he knows, he understands the distance. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4279.94s)]
*  If he wants to jab his way in, or when he wants to commit, he does the work for me when [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4283.34s)]
*  he comes in, I'm going to make him pay. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4287.9s)]
*  And he's quick, he can just do it. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4289.7s)]
*  Like mid combo, the guy's fine. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4291.62s)]
*  He's just going boom, boom, already free piece, like halfway through. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4293.9s)]
*  Great balance. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4297.22s)]
*  Oh mate, it's incredible. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4298.22s)]
*  When he chose to go forward or go first, he did a great job of even bridging the gap. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4300.42s)]
*  What was he doing to close the gap? [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4305.7s)]
*  I just bridged, rather than me just stepping with, as you did a bit of boxing, back foot [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4307.94s)]
*  and you're just sort of stepping that front foot in. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4312.7s)]
*  Bridging's going to be more of a leap, you're going to leap everything. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4315.62s)]
*  So your whole base has to go further. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4319.26s)]
*  I'm a little bit further back, so just me stepping with a normal jab is going to pull [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4321.22s)]
*  short. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4325.18s)]
*  But you bridge the gap, we call it. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4326.18s)]
*  You literally bridge your whole body, both feet. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4328.419999999999s)]
*  You're stepping in. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4331.58s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4332.58s)]
*  So both feet end up getting right where you want to be so you can fire the big shots as [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4333.58s)]
*  well. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4336.46s)]
*  And it was always well balanced like you said. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4337.46s)]
*  It was so much fun to watch. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4339.74s)]
*  The guy's on three weeks notice, right? [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4342.139999999999s)]
*  He had a big fight three weeks ago, won it in spectacular fashion. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4343.94s)]
*  And then I think he broke his toe, nobody said anything about it, which I like. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4348.86s)]
*  I know all you guys fight injured, so it is weird. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4352.0199999999995s)]
*  And it is cool after the fact, like when someone wins to acknowledge injuries. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4354.3s)]
*  But a thing I've noticed that's different obviously from MMA and boxing is like boxing [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4359.5s)]
*  is closer because you don't have to worry about the legs, right? [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4363.9800000000005s)]
*  So the fight is a little bit closer. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4367.12s)]
*  Like MMA, there's a little bit more distance. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4368.58s)]
*  So when you are bridging the gap, like you said, when you're committing, you're really [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4371.4800000000005s)]
*  putting yourself in the lion's den, which you have to do because everybody you fight [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4376.42s)]
*  is fucking six feet tall. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4379.66s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4381.14s)]
*  So when I'm watching, when I was watching these guys like manage that distance, I saw [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4382.3s)]
*  something I thought was really cool. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4387.06s)]
*  You know, a lot of times in boxing, you'll see like a pull counter like Floyd was magnificent [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4388.660000000001s)]
*  at this, right? [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4393.22s)]
*  Like a jab comes in, you'll embrace the jab. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4394.22s)]
*  You'll even kind of step back a little, not even step back, but like lean back and then [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4396.820000000001s)]
*  throw the right on top. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4399.860000000001s)]
*  It looked like Van was moving into the jab. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4401.26s)]
*  Like he wasn't even stepping back. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4406.1s)]
*  I imagine like in your career, you've had to kind of submit to that situation as well, [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4408.3s)]
*  where it's like the only way you're closing that gap is if you're moving into the punch [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4413.66s)]
*  that's coming at you. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4417.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, it depends on who you got. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4419.26s)]
*  Like you were just saying with him, he did a great job of still being in a position where [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4421.7s)]
*  he could hope that jab misses or whatever it is, but you're right, he would usually [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4426.06s)]
*  throw, I think from what I remember, it was like a hook even. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4429.1s)]
*  As he was throwing the jab, boom, boom, boom, and then just to be like a free piece as he [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4433.1s)]
*  was coming in, which was pretty impressive to land a hook in that sort of a, you know, [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4435.9s)]
*  where he was positioned. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4442.0199999999995s)]
*  But with myself, like with the last one- [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4443.82s)]
*  You're making money, bro. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4446.74s)]
*  That's all I am. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4447.74s)]
*  Oh, you're making money. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4448.74s)]
*  I was like, you blow, okay, okay. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4449.74s)]
*  I thought you had the reserve meal. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4452.74s)]
*  But for me, like with the last one, I had Diego Lopez, who's very similar, where he [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4456.82s)]
*  won't, like he won't even try and dodge your punch. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4463.339999999999s)]
*  And he's swinging, he's stepping up. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4467.179999999999s)]
*  Most people that want to counter, they're going to try and slip the punch and fire at [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4469.219999999999s)]
*  the same time, if that makes sense, where he was just, I'm just going to, as soon as [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4471.9s)]
*  you go, I'm just all offence. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4475.78s)]
*  I don't care about defense one bit, which makes them dangerous, but obviously they can [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4478.139999999999s)]
*  be hitable, but he had a good chin. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4481.7s)]
*  Where I just felt like Joshua Van did a great job of, you know, just waiting for, to Ray [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4483.299999999999s)]
*  Valle, really committed and then was able to sort of counter. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4488.9s)]
*  They weren't too far, like when you're saying with the distance, I try not to get too technical. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4492.7s)]
*  No, be technical. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4496.3s)]
*  Yeah, but with the range, sometimes MMA, they go a little bit further. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4497.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4500.66s)]
*  But because Ray Valle likes the boxing, he was trying to just stay just out of that boxing [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4501.66s)]
*  range, you know, but Joshua Van did a great job of just making everything he threw count [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4505.62s)]
*  at the right time. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4511.58s)]
*  And then it looked like the ram was getting away from him. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4512.66s)]
*  And then he would just go, blah, blah, blah, and just like, feet, reaction. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4515.38s)]
*  And then to finish it at the end of the third, like almost finish him. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4518.42s)]
*  Okay. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4521.46s)]
*  But it's got to watch that fight anyway. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4521.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's got to. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4523.22s)]
*  And then of course, obviously the toporia, your boy. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4524.22s)]
*  Have you watched, do you watch those fights? [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4530.860000000001s)]
*  Like when you get, what is that like for you? [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4533.3s)]
*  Like when you, I don't even know how to ask you these questions. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4535.900000000001s)]
*  Like when you get caught, like what is that when you're rewatching it? [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4539.78s)]
*  Can you watch, can you separate yourself from it and just look at it technically and be [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4544.5s)]
*  like, oh, I shouldn't have been in it? [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4548.66s)]
*  Definitely. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4550.42s)]
*  That's the only way I sort of look at it. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4551.42s)]
*  Like obviously you understand Ilya's power, but with that fight you're talking about, [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4552.58s)]
*  or even with the Islam fight, the second one, with the two knockouts, I just look at, you [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4557.46s)]
*  know, man, like, you know, I should have done this, should have done that. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4562.38s)]
*  They're pretty obvious to me anyway. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4565.1s)]
*  So it's easy. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4566.7s)]
*  The second Islam fight, I feel like your hand's here and he like clips like the top. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4567.7s)]
*  He earned that position. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4573.06s)]
*  He earned that knockout. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4574.26s)]
*  But to me that was like, it's not luck at all, it's skill, et cetera. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4575.26s)]
*  But I would say positioning wise, it's not like you were like grotesquely out of position [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4581.820000000001s)]
*  in that moment that you got caught. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4586.34s)]
*  Well, no, exactly. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4587.860000000001s)]
*  Well, the difference with that fight in the first fight, like I will try and, like I also [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4588.860000000001s)]
*  been a bit more clever when I wanted to get into range and, you know, I didn't want to [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4595.54s)]
*  just walk forward. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4599.22s)]
*  On first fight or second? [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4600.22s)]
*  On the first fight. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4601.22s)]
*  Second fight, you know, short notice, very, very short notice. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4603.18s)]
*  So I was like, all right, I can't just sit back and, you know, sort of just wait around [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4605.58s)]
*  and win rounds. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4611.22s)]
*  I don't, you know, I'm not going to win five rounds against Islam right now. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4612.22s)]
*  I didn't back myself because I didn't have the camp. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4615.18s)]
*  It was 11 days. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4617.1s)]
*  So I'm like, oh, you're saying cardio wise. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4618.42s)]
*  Cardio wise, I'm like, I'm not, you know, I'm not going to win a five decision against [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4620.26s)]
*  Islam. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4624.26s)]
*  Well, the chances are a lot slimmer because I'm not going to be as fit as I'd like to [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4625.26s)]
*  be. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4629.02s)]
*  So you're looking to get him out of there. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4630.02s)]
*  So that's what I wanted. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4631.02s)]
*  I'm going to press. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4632.820000000001s)]
*  That's why I'm going to come into range. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4633.820000000001s)]
*  So it means I'm going to be in range to be hit more. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4634.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4637.820000000001s)]
*  I knew that he would be kicking. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4638.820000000001s)]
*  I knew that he would spam the kicks, especially because I was going to come forward like that. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4639.9800000000005s)]
*  And even when he was kicking, I knew he was going to still go up your aisle. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4644.900000000001s)]
*  So I knew that was going to come. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4647.5s)]
*  But it was just what I hated about that is because I told myself, and this is, I guess, [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4649.22s)]
*  how I am. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4654.700000000001s)]
*  And I guess you need this sort of mindset and be able to do this. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4655.700000000001s)]
*  Like whatever decision I make, that's it. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4657.580000000001s)]
*  I'm locking. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4659.14s)]
*  I'm going to, you know, I'm going to tell myself. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4660.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4661.26s)]
*  And I'm going to tell myself and I'm going to believe it. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4662.26s)]
*  And I'm going to be delusional in a sense where that's all right. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4663.62s)]
*  I could be, this is going to be the most dangerous I've ever been because I'm going out there [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4666.22s)]
*  to take his head off. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4670.18s)]
*  You know, having had a camp, you know, I reckon this makes me more dangerous. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4671.700000000001s)]
*  And I believed it. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4674.5s)]
*  And then I go out there and I couldn't even pull the trigger. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4675.5s)]
*  And when I say I couldn't pull the trigger, I'm like sitting there and I'm like, it makes [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4678.5s)]
*  sense, right? [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4681.38s)]
*  You didn't have much of a camp, barely any sparring. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4682.38s)]
*  You know, and then you see your timing is just not going to be there. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4685.9800000000005s)]
*  So I wanted to be like, I'm going to be in his face and then just let the hands go and [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4689.099999999999s)]
*  I'll catch him. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4692.34s)]
*  So while I was there and then I just could not let him go. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4693.54s)]
*  So here I am, I just felt like I'm just standing in front of him waiting for something to happen, [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4696.0s)]
*  right? [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4699.78s)]
*  So yeah, just, and then he was going body. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4700.78s)]
*  I'm like even telling myself he's going to go high, he's going to go high. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4702.34s)]
*  Wait for it. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4704.78s)]
*  And then still just flex a bit. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4705.78s)]
*  I'm like, oh fuck. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4706.78s)]
*  You know, like I was still, it's weird because I was gone, but I knew exactly what was happening. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4707.78s)]
*  If that makes sense. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4714.7s)]
*  Did you have the vision wobble? [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4715.7s)]
*  No, no, not really. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4716.78s)]
*  It was like, I don't know if it sort of went dark and then it was a loud noise. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4717.78s)]
*  I remember just like, like these weird noise like that. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4721.94s)]
*  And I remember it's hard to explain, but then I've known, oh no, I'm rocked. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4726.099999999999s)]
*  Like I remember I'm like, no, no, no, try and survive, survive. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4730.34s)]
*  Next minute I'm on the ground like try and survive. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4733.54s)]
*  I don't think my body was doing what I wanted to do. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4734.98s)]
*  And I think I'm just wobbling around like this. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4736.9s)]
*  But it's, but yeah, that's the game we play. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4741.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4743.74s)]
*  All right. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4744.78s)]
*  I'm getting real technical today. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4745.78s)]
*  I know. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4746.78s)]
*  But with the, the fight, the Tupori fight, I, yeah, you know, I come, it was a quick [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4747.78s)]
*  turnaround, you know, I probably shouldn't have went into that fight so quick. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4753.42s)]
*  You know, you start, that was a proper concussion after the Islam one. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4758.3s)]
*  You got to take a little time off. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4761.099999999999s)]
*  So that's already, especially with a guy who can crack. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4762.26s)]
*  Exactly right. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4764.94s)]
*  So you should be letting their head rest. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4765.94s)]
*  And not only that, even me trying to get back into it, we did everything right. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4767.3s)]
*  Like in a sense where we made sure everything that was like, and made sure, you know, we [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4771.14s)]
*  did the steps to move forward. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4775.9400000000005s)]
*  But even when I first started getting back into camp, I hear I am watching, I need to [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4777.58s)]
*  be careful of getting caught. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4781.38s)]
*  I don't want to get hit. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4782.700000000001s)]
*  So you're already going into camp bad habits. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4784.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4785.9400000000005s)]
*  And then a month or two later you're fighting someone and then you could even just see the [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4786.9400000000005s)]
*  way I'm fighting. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4789.9400000000005s)]
*  I was, I just look back at that and be like, ah, I understand. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4790.9400000000005s)]
*  It felt more cautious. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4794.02s)]
*  Like you were in and out. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4795.38s)]
*  I wanted to go and then I go and the, you know, it's like, I have a go or don't go [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4796.38s)]
*  or if you're all right, if you're worried about it, shoot for the takedown then. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4800.94s)]
*  So why are you like second guessing halfway through? [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4804.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4806.7s)]
*  You could put yourself in a worse position and be like, I better get the fuck out of [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4807.7s)]
*  here. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4809.9s)]
*  Then what adjustments did you make in your next fight after Deporia? [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4810.9s)]
*  Well that's a good question. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4813.94s)]
*  So luckily I drilled so much of a, because it's not like Diego Lopez doesn't hit hard [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4815.34s)]
*  at all. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4820.18s)]
*  And like we said, how he fires, he's just going to sit on them. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4821.18s)]
*  So a lot of good drilling we had to do, like really good drilling. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4824.46s)]
*  So I was lucky enough to have the team that I did around me for the training. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4827.22s)]
*  So you take extra time off this time to make sure you're not in that mentality. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4830.740000000001s)]
*  I had a massive break, biggest break I've ever had. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4832.700000000001s)]
*  You know, it took that real serious and then had a massive camp. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4835.54s)]
*  So I did a, you know, well above and beyond. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4838.780000000001s)]
*  Usually everyone knows I train hard, you know, that's always going to be the case. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4841.740000000001s)]
*  But this time, even with my diet, I didn't have a cheat meal for like 16 weeks. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4844.740000000001s)]
*  I didn't have a drop of alcohol for the 16 weeks. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4848.5s)]
*  No bubbler? [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4851.34s)]
*  No, no bubblers, no bubblers. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4852.34s)]
*  That's for probably more than 16 weeks. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4854.46s)]
*  But you still remember that one. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4858.06s)]
*  Well, never forget that. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4860.46s)]
*  Fair enough. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4861.780000000001s)]
*  But yeah, so it was just, yeah, we did everything, went above and beyond for that one. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4864.42s)]
*  And you know, we're well, but with him, he had to... [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4869.26s)]
*  He's got a great short, it's like a right hook. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4872.06s)]
*  The punch that he caught Charles with. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4876.1s)]
*  I think... [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4880.3s)]
*  You're talking about Ilya? [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4881.3s)]
*  Ilya, sorry. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4882.3s)]
*  It's like this, he steps in with it. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4883.3s)]
*  It's like he doesn't even throw like a long extended jab. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4884.62s)]
*  It's almost like a fake left hand, but he sits down. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4887.14s)]
*  But what's interesting is that in one of the first exchanges with Charles and him, Charles [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4890.78s)]
*  threw like a kind of long straight right hand that beat Ilya's right hook. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4895.54s)]
*  And it looked like it kind of landed. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4901.94s)]
*  It didn't like hurt him, but in the exchange where Charles gets knocked out, he throws [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4904.14s)]
*  the same punch and it just missed it. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4908.9s)]
*  But it was interesting. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4912.86s)]
*  I wonder if people watch that. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4914.02s)]
*  I think Ilya is phenomenal, but I wonder if there are people that watch that who are taller. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4915.3s)]
*  Because now he's going to be fighting taller guys. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4921.02s)]
*  You go up in weight, like we're talking about a 10 pound difference, that's like, that could [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4922.5s)]
*  be six inches. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4925.46s)]
*  I wonder if there are people that see that and go, I might be able to catch him coming [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4927.34s)]
*  in. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4933.780000000001s)]
*  The cost of not catching him coming in is lights out. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4934.780000000001s)]
*  You've got to punish him for coming in or else he'll just keep walking straight, right? [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4939.660000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4942.740000000001s)]
*  But then again, you're playing into his world as well. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4944.46s)]
*  But you know he's going to fight and he's going to counter, so obviously he can get [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4947.139999999999s)]
*  caught. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4951.62s)]
*  But with Charles, I just thought he probably had more other ways of winning. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4952.62s)]
*  He probably should have avoided the crash. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4956.219999999999s)]
*  You know, when he just did it and he just decided to crash. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4958.62s)]
*  And I knew that. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4961.62s)]
*  That's why I picked a first round finish. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4962.62s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4964.46s)]
*  Yeah, I thought Ilya was going to knock him out. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4965.46s)]
*  I don't know if you noticed though in the fight, what he did great was he ended up pulling [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4967.26s)]
*  Charles into it. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4972.3s)]
*  When he was going to jab, Charles would want to follow up. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4974.42s)]
*  So he jabs through the body and then Charles didn't end up following. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4977.0599999999995s)]
*  But then he ends up jabbing again, goes high and then he shifts. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4979.74s)]
*  I don't know if you watch it back and you'll see him shift actually to his left. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4984.42s)]
*  So off the center line. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4988.0599999999995s)]
*  Off center, he shifts to his left. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4989.0599999999995s)]
*  But he jab, shifts knowing and as soon as he come knowing that he was going to at least [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4990.98s)]
*  step and maybe fire, even if he didn't step and fire, he was always stepping back into [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=4995.18s)]
*  that range because he went back and then Charles wanted to be back here and just use [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5000.26s)]
*  that to come straight in. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5004.9400000000005s)]
*  And Charles is a very like back and forth straight. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5006.66s)]
*  He's not really hitting with angles. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5010.46s)]
*  And you know, you said that the right miss, could it have been that shift? [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5011.46s)]
*  Now he's just circled Charles more into his own right hand. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5015.9800000000005s)]
*  Oh, there it is. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5020.58s)]
*  Yeah, you know what I mean? [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5021.58s)]
*  And then is that what it is? [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5022.58s)]
*  And then goes in and then just did that little bit. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5023.58s)]
*  So if he went in a straight line, probably could have still slipped and maybe missed. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5026.06s)]
*  Shifting off as he wanted to step into that right line, he stepped into Charles, I'm sorry, [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5030.18s)]
*  Ilya's right hand. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5035.38s)]
*  So if you watch him, watch him when he shifts, he even shifts off center. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5037.3s)]
*  So he's moving Charles off center while he's shifting. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5040.780000000001s)]
*  As he shifted, knowing that he was going to follow. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5043.740000000001s)]
*  So whatever he did that on purpose, I don't know. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5046.06s)]
*  But it seems like it was pretty strategic, even the way he didn't just shift back, you [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5049.700000000001s)]
*  see him shift off center. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5052.700000000001s)]
*  So usually it's easy to shift to your right. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5056.22s)]
*  It would be harder to shift to your left. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5059.18s)]
*  Yeah, it's like in boxing, the guys who are great body punchers, like there's a guy named [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5062.860000000001s)]
*  Miguel Cotto. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5067.620000000001s)]
*  Do you remember Miguel? [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5068.620000000001s)]
*  He had a really strong jab, but then he would shift and put his weight over his left foot [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5069.620000000001s)]
*  and then just rip those body punches. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5074.5s)]
*  And I think the concern in MMA, I would imagine, is like shifting left, there's a foot or a [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5076.900000000001s)]
*  shin that's going to come right to the top of your head potentially. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5083.06s)]
*  In boxing, when you shift over, there's not much that can hit you. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5086.22s)]
*  Like maybe an uppercut can be under, but like if I'm this way and you're a conventional [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5090.14s)]
*  fighter, what do you throw? [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5096.18s)]
*  Like a knee or something? [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5098.02s)]
*  So if you keep dipping that way, you're saying? [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5099.54s)]
*  If I dip this way and you're conventional, you're fighting orthodox, that fucking game [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5101.860000000001s)]
*  over. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5108.26s)]
*  So it's like a risky move too. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5109.26s)]
*  So with the shifter, I mean she sort of shifted back out of range, but out. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5111.5s)]
*  So not really with the slip, he ended up slipping with the punch when he decided to throw the [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5117.58s)]
*  two. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5121.46s)]
*  Now I'm going to get real technical. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5122.46s)]
*  Alright, so when he even shifts off center, the only thing is when you shift to your left, [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5124.22s)]
*  he shifts and then... [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5130.58s)]
*  He can stand if he wants. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5131.58s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to stand. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5132.58s)]
*  Is that alright? [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5133.58s)]
*  No. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5134.58s)]
*  Still in? [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5135.58s)]
*  I'm Charles. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5136.58s)]
*  So yeah, so he's sort of, when he's shifted back and then he sort of went bang and then [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5137.58s)]
*  he sort of shifted here. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5140.58s)]
*  But now look at arm side, if I walk straight, then you're... [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5142.3s)]
*  But I'm off center here. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5145.78s)]
*  So there's nothing I can throw at you. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5146.78s)]
*  Even I feel like off here, but you notice he shifts back and then as soon as he comes [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5150.22s)]
*  in he goes boom and he even shifts his hips straight in. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5153.78s)]
*  So he shifts back and then just goes boom. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5156.62s)]
*  So now you're walking straight into the right and you don't have anything with power to [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5160.3s)]
*  kind of... [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5163.58s)]
*  I guess I'm like reaching over. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5164.58s)]
*  Yeah, so you've got an angle and then again I pulled you. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5165.58s)]
*  Pulled that way. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5169.1s)]
*  Oh, you're fixing that. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5170.660000000001s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5171.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5172.660000000001s)]
*  So he's shifted this way, but again, far from here, of course your body would have been [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5173.660000000001s)]
*  hard, so he even shifted and as soon as he went he just went bang. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5177.3s)]
*  And then I'm walking straight. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5180.9800000000005s)]
*  So he's even shifted his... [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5181.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5182.9800000000005s)]
*  You know, you slipped his head with that left foot. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5183.9800000000005s)]
*  So what's the strategy against a guy like Ilya? [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5186.620000000001s)]
*  I hope that makes sense. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5188.620000000001s)]
*  Hopefully that makes sense. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5189.620000000001s)]
*  Watch it anyway, it makes sense. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5190.620000000001s)]
*  Tell us, so what's the strategy against a guy like Ilya? [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5192.620000000001s)]
*  Let's say you guys run it back again. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5194.54s)]
*  Wrestle the bloke, mate. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5196.14s)]
*  You got to get him. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5197.14s)]
*  Get him down, right? [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5198.14s)]
*  Yeah, that's what you want. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5199.18s)]
*  You want to see what's going to happen with his gas tank. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5200.18s)]
*  So even with Ilya, great fighter, like even a lot of the things he does, like I'm sure [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5202.660000000001s)]
*  a lot of it's well trained and then he's got so many good instincts as well. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5210.54s)]
*  Like even him just shifting that way, he's probably trained for that, but then just as [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5215.3s)]
*  soon as he wanted to square his hips up with the right hand, the power was there and put [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5218.5s)]
*  him in a safer position while he was following too. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5222.34s)]
*  So just little things like that he probably trains for or it's just great instincts. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5224.86s)]
*  But yeah, we want to see the gas tanks, see what happens with it. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5230.38s)]
*  Because I thought Charles when he was taking him down and forcing the sort of wrestle and [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5234.099999999999s)]
*  the grapple, I felt like it was starting to wear on him a little bit. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5238.66s)]
*  So even when he sort of ended up on top with the grapple, I don't know if you remember [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5242.46s)]
*  Ilya gets up and then, well I remember he was just starting to stay up and then was [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5248.339999999999s)]
*  kicking him. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5252.54s)]
*  He waited, he waited, I'm going to wait 30 seconds, kick his legs, get my breath back [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5254.22s)]
*  because you know, that probably took a little bit out of him, which I thought was clever. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5258.78s)]
*  And then the ref stood him up and then he's like, right back to work. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5263.62s)]
*  So now you get a little break. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5266.62s)]
*  So you would attack the gas tank and you do that by like grappling cardio? [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5267.62s)]
*  I guess you would have to. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5271.46s)]
*  So again, when you're right, you want to catch him coming in because he wants to commit as [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5273.42s)]
*  well. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5279.62s)]
*  But there's that danger of him landing as well. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5280.62s)]
*  100%. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5282.0199999999995s)]
*  Charles, you know, he should have known that, all right, this guy's just going to try and [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5283.5s)]
*  take my head off. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5286.46s)]
*  I've got world-class jiu-jitsu and Charles is pretty strong. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5287.46s)]
*  He's improved his wrestling as well. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5291.5s)]
*  I might take it there. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5293.46s)]
*  You know, take him in the championship rounds if I have to or I finish him early. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5294.46s)]
*  I feel like a lot of these guys though, it's like you've had so much success and maybe [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5297.780000000001s)]
*  you felt this too, like you have so much success throughout your career doing something. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5301.42s)]
*  And like, it's very hard to make that change because it might chip away at your confidence. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5306.5s)]
*  You're like, I give a lot of credit to Ankalayev. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5311.9s)]
*  Like when Ankalayev fought Perdida, I think all of us were going, there's no way he's [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5314.5s)]
*  actually going to bang with this guy. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5318.299999999999s)]
*  And then he outstruck him. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5320.62s)]
*  So like, I imagine if you're Charles, you're like, I'm one of the best fighters in the [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5322.78s)]
*  world. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5326.5s)]
*  Like, why would I change what I do for a guy who's coming up 10 pounds? [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5327.5s)]
*  You know, does that chip away your confidence at all when you go, I have to not do what [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5330.46s)]
*  I normally do against this guy? [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5334.099999999999s)]
*  Depends on the fighter, I guess. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5335.74s)]
*  And yeah, you're right. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5337.42s)]
*  It seemed like he's not, I'm going to press him and I'm going to show the weight, you [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5338.7s)]
*  know what I mean? [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5342.139999999999s)]
*  But then I just thought that's what I thought was going to happen. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5343.139999999999s)]
*  That's why I thought Eli was going to knock him out. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5344.82s)]
*  And that's it. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5346.94s)]
*  Because he's not so defensive. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5347.94s)]
*  He's, you know, he's all offense, Charles. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5348.94s)]
*  So he's easy. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5351.86s)]
*  Can you already know what time it is? [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5355.38s)]
*  You see the lighting. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5356.98s)]

*  a noodle or whatever. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5382.099999999999s)]

*  Also, it's trackable. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5434.58s)]
*  Someone steals your wallet, fall them back to their house, steal whatever they have. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5435.58s)]
*  That's illegal. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5438.5s)]
*  Okay? [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5439.5s)]

*  Who do you want next, bro? [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5487.7s)]
*  Well, it's a weird one, right? [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5488.7s)]
*  Because I've got a few guys, you've got some exciting guys that don't really deserve them, [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5489.7s)]
*  and you've got a guy that... [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5493.139999999999s)]
*  What about Bonnie Blue? [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5494.139999999999s)]
*  What about that? [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5495.139999999999s)]
*  She's doing some rounds, isn't she? [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5496.139999999999s)]
*  You got a gas tank, dude. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5497.139999999999s)]
*  You know what that about, gas tanks? [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5498.139999999999s)]

*  Yeah, that might be a good match. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5506.139999999999s)]
*  That's a money fight, though. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5512.099999999999s)]
*  Like, that's not for Bell. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5513.099999999999s)]
*  It's not for anything. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5514.66s)]
*  But if you were the guy that could take out Bonnie Blue, like a thousand have tried. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5516.5s)]
*  Yeah, I ain't going there. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5519.5s)]
*  That's for sure. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5521.5s)]
*  No, who do you want next? [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5522.5s)]
*  Who do I want next? [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5524.5s)]
*  All right, well yeah, look, Mobzar's probably the guy that I think deserves it, right? [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5525.5s)]
*  That's what I've always been about. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5530.46s)]
*  I've always been about who deserves it. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5531.46s)]
*  I'm about you making money. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5532.86s)]
*  That's what I'm about. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5535.139999999999s)]
*  That makes sense. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5536.139999999999s)]
*  I see you with the girls. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5537.139999999999s)]
*  Most of the times it's contract fights anyway. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5538.139999999999s)]
*  So they have a say in... [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5542.46s)]
*  Well, it's contract. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5544.26s)]
*  So you get a piece of that paper view. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5545.26s)]
*  Paper view, yeah, you're right. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5547.66s)]
*  But yeah, let's get into that a little bit more. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5549.38s)]
*  The paper view system isn't as good as it used to be. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5552.02s)]
*  Talk to me. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5554.5s)]
*  Well, I can't give too much away with it. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5555.5s)]
*  Well, give me an idea. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5557.54s)]
*  No, I just mean it's just the way it works is just a little bit different now. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5558.54s)]
*  That's why you're seeing the paper views now, you know, they're starting to look like they're [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5562.3s)]
*  dropping drastically because it's just the way the system is. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5566.54s)]
*  And there's still millions and millions of views, but you only get paid on certain paper [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5570.54s)]
*  views. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5576.46s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5577.46s)]
*  So it's a hard sort of way. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5578.46s)]
*  Asker explained it a lot more, but you're not... [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5579.86s)]
*  When you see the paper views buyers, you're only seeing only a couple of countries and [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5583.42s)]
*  it's only over $40 as well. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5589.0199999999995s)]
*  They're the only paper views, not including your say in England, it's a subscription base. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5592.38s)]
*  So you're not including any of those. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5597.86s)]
*  There's only like, I think, three or four countries that actually... [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5601.82s)]
*  That contribute to the actual paper view. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5605.0599999999995s)]
*  How does that change financially? [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5606.94s)]
*  Are you like, I can still make as much as I could before or can you not make quite as [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5609.179999999999s)]
*  much as you could before? [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5613.179999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean, you can still make money. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5614.179999999999s)]
*  Like, again, the right fight, it's just very hard. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5615.9s)]
*  If you've got a Conor McGregor on the card or someone like John Jones, I'm like, all [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5617.98s)]
*  right, now you can really, really make some, you know, they can tie up some of that money [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5621.219999999999s)]
*  compared to what you're fighting for. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5625.139999999999s)]
*  But it's just, it's pretty hard. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5628.3s)]
*  So even now, good cards, like the paper views that you're seeing, good cards at like 300, [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5629.86s)]
*  400, that's considered really good now. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5634.1s)]
*  Really? [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5636.42s)]
*  When you say 300, 400, you mean 300, 400,000 buys. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5637.42s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5640.54s)]
*  Whereas like, the huge monumental fights might have been at a million. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5641.54s)]
*  Yeah, 1.3. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5645.74s)]
*  I'll say it exactly. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5646.74s)]
*  So it's hard, I don't know, again, I probably shouldn't be talking this because I don't [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5647.86s)]
*  know enough about it, but it's just not sort of how it used to be. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5651.66s)]
*  Now we've all the different deals, like TV rights deals and all that. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5655.74s)]
*  I think it's just a little bit different. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5661.26s)]
*  And now again, you've probably got all the streamings and all that as well, right? [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5663.46s)]
*  So I don't think everyone, the only way to watch it is to buy a pay-per-view. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5666.3s)]
*  There's other ways people are probably trying to watch it too, right? [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5670.3s)]
*  So there's a lot of things that factor into it nowadays, but yeah. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5673.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's tricky because, I don't know, I've heard some people say that, I've heard [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5677.86s)]
*  some people say like currently the UFC has like a star problem, like they don't have [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5683.7s)]
*  like as many stars as they did. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5687.78s)]
*  I think that what people need to understand is that like this happens in all fight sports, [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5690.06s)]
*  even the ones that are predetermined. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5696.24s)]
*  Like it happened in wrestling. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5699.1s)]
*  Like you go through ebbs and flows. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5700.62s)]
*  Even non-fight sports, when Jordan retired, there was a ratings drop. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5702.58s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5705.82s)]
*  We didn't have a Jordan yet, then we got Kobe, then we got LeBron, LeBron's gone, same thing. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5706.82s)]
*  So it's not like, oh my God, is the UFC over? [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5709.7s)]
*  It's like, no, no, no. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5713.0599999999995s)]
*  What's going to happen is we had a time where there's you, there's Izzy, John Jones, a [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5714.0599999999995s)]
*  fight, like there was like a five, six year period where it was like every division had [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5719.3s)]
*  multiple the Diaz, but it's like multiple guys that you needed to watch. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5723.72s)]
*  And now some of you guys are getting up there. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5728.8s)]
*  Some people are retiring, some people are losing some fights and a new crop needs to [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5731.54s)]
*  come up. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5736.0199999999995s)]
*  And you refuse to let that happen in your division. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5737.14s)]
*  There's this guy with his beautiful haircut and a great backstory and you're like, I'm [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5739.62s)]
*  not out yet. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5745.740000000001s)]
*  So I'll just take the belt back to fucking Australia. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5746.740000000001s)]
*  He's a great story, but my story's still going. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5748.740000000001s)]
*  I know dude. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5750.9800000000005s)]
*  They had this guy's story so fucking down pat. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5751.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm watching this thing, I'm getting emotional. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5754.62s)]
*  I see you coming out, I'm like, nah, Valk's not giving it to him today. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5756.26s)]
*  I'm almost 40, but you ain't having it yet. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5760.700000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5762.5s)]
*  Nah, it's a, there is a lot of people, like you're right though, exactly what you said. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5763.5s)]
*  Like that's just how it sort of goes. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5767.1s)]
*  But there is so many good fighters coming through. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5769.18s)]
*  Like I'm watching, like even Joshua Van, another good example. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5772.620000000001s)]
*  But I mean, even my division, you've got, you've got Pico that's just come in. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5775.9800000000005s)]
*  Obviously he has a couple of- Aaron? [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5782.18s)]
*  Is it Aaron Pico? [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5783.18s)]
*  Aaron Pico. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5784.18s)]
*  He has a couple of like really good boxing and wrestling background. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5785.18s)]
*  So that'll be interesting to see. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5788.8s)]
*  I haven't watched enough of him, but it will be interesting to see how he goes. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5789.8s)]
*  But then you have, oh, I'm having a brain fight now. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5792.68s)]
*  This is the fighting nerds. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5797.240000000001s)]
*  Oh, oh, oh God. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5800.96s)]
*  In Featherweight. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5802.96s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5803.96s)]
*  You guys did a face off recently. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5804.96s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5806.4400000000005s)]
*  Do you remember his name? [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5807.4400000000005s)]
*  Not Kyle, Kyle. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5808.4400000000005s)]
*  Silver, silver, silver. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5809.4400000000005s)]
*  He's phenomenal. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5810.4400000000005s)]
*  And he's a great fighter. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5811.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5812.4400000000005s)]
*  Great fighter. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5813.4400000000005s)]
*  You've got a lot of them actually coming. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5814.4400000000005s)]
*  So I don't think it's too long till you get a lot of names there. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5815.4400000000005s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5818.68s)]
*  The next generation comes up. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5819.68s)]
*  But it might still go and not let them in. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5820.68s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5821.68s)]
*  Or am I done by then? [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5822.68s)]
*  We'll see. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5824.360000000001s)]
*  But I don't think it's too far away where you're going to start to see this new school. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5825.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, the fighting nerds, even Ruffy and that as well. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5828.6s)]
*  Have you watched Ruffy? [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5832.52s)]
*  Yeah, phenomenal. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5833.52s)]
*  Have you guys watched him? [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5834.52s)]
*  Yeah, amazing. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5835.52s)]
*  Just watch his training footage and that as well. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5836.52s)]
*  Watch his latest knockout. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5837.52s)]
*  Oh, EVL. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5838.52s)]
*  Yeah, watch his fights. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5839.52s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5840.52s)]
*  And his. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5841.52s)]
*  No, there's a lot of good guys coming out. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5842.52s)]
*  Another thing that's interesting with fighting specifically though is that fighters, the [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5844.92s)]
*  fighters that I think that we've gravitated to throughout history are the ones where you [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5850.68s)]
*  don't know the next thing that's going to come out of their mouth. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5856.16s)]
*  Right? [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5858.96s)]
*  Like, Mike Tyson, Mike Tyson just going like, I'm going to, I'm going to eat your kids. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5859.96s)]
*  I'm going to fuck you till you love me. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5864.88s)]
*  Like, the reason why Tyson can have a podcast, can do whatever he wants is because we never [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5866.68s)]
*  know the next thing he's going to say. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5871.92s)]
*  And so there's like, there's heels as you would have in wrestling and there's like baby [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5874.72s)]
*  faces like you, the good guys that we all root for. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5879.280000000001s)]
*  Have you heard that wrestling term? [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5881.280000000001s)]
*  Baby face. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5883.04s)]
*  That means like a good guy. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5884.04s)]
*  Good guy. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5885.04s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, sweet. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5886.04s)]
*  You know, like you're the guy that, that, you know, we root for. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5887.04s)]
*  You're the guy that's like, wait a minute, he's, he's not even close to as tall as Zach. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5889.88s)]
*  How the fuck is he going to be? [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5893.400000000001s)]
*  And then you fucking do it. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5894.400000000001s)]
*  Right? [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5895.400000000001s)]
*  And you're, you remind us weirdly, you shouldn't at all because you're a professional athlete [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5896.400000000001s)]
*  before this, but like, I think you remind us a little bit of ourselves. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5899.76s)]
*  You're like, holy shit, like he's going up against all odds. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5902.240000000001s)]
*  You know, that first fight with Markachev. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5904.4800000000005s)]
*  You're like, how the fuck did this happen? [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5906.200000000001s)]
*  So we need that. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5908.639999999999s)]
*  But you also need the Diaz brothers. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5910.2s)]
*  You need Nate to just go out there and say crazy. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5911.96s)]
*  You need Connor to rile shit up. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5914.04s)]
*  And I think one thing that people might say about like the Dagestanis is as prolific as [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5916.04s)]
*  they are, they're so disciplined in like the press conference. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5920.4s)]
*  They're not really saying anything that's going to make you go. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5924.24s)]
*  They're not going to say, I'm going to eat your kids. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5927.4s)]
*  You know, they're going to be like, I respect him. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5928.4s)]
*  He's a very nice person. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5930.92s)]
*  Everything's good. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5931.92s)]
*  You know, whereas Connor's going to go, Hey, your wife's a towel, man. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5932.92s)]
*  He's just going to say. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5937.44s)]
*  So it's like, I think we might need those, like a Strickland, for example, like fills [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5938.36s)]
*  that void a bit. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5943.5199999999995s)]
*  Like he's going to say wild stuff. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5944.5199999999995s)]
*  And because of that, people are going to either want to see him win or lose, but they're going [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5946.96s)]
*  to pay the price of admission. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5950.04s)]
*  So maybe there's a version of that. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5951.679999999999s)]
*  And it goes back to sort of what you were saying with the stars and non-stars. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5953.04s)]
*  Could you imagine if everyone tried to do that? [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5959.139999999999s)]
*  It'd be exhausting. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5961.12s)]
*  You need to have a balance. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5962.12s)]
*  You don't have, and then someone comes through and then like, like Ilya started doing a [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5963.12s)]
*  bit of the trash. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5966.4s)]
*  He's actually a very respectful guy. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5967.5199999999995s)]
*  Now I don't think you need to do it. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5968.72s)]
*  So like now you probably will see him pull back from the trash talk because he's already [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5970.76s)]
*  a star and he's actually a really, really good dude. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5975.54s)]
*  So you probably won't see that. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5978.599999999999s)]
*  But I mean, when you've got someone talking trash like that and they're full of confidence [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5979.88s)]
*  and get knockouts, you know, they just blow up. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5984.22s)]
*  Connor McGregor, right? [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5986.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5987.72s)]
*  So, and, but when you see people, it's so force and it's just, you just sit there. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5988.72s)]
*  I mean, and then everyone hates it. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5992.08s)]
*  A lot of people hate it. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5993.36s)]
*  So I guess, but in saying that even though they hate it, they want to see him lose. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5994.36s)]
*  And I guess that's still got people watching. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5997.68s)]
*  So it's still, but I mean, imagine if everyone was doing it. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=5999.16s)]
*  Exhausting. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6001.92s)]
*  So I mean, I'm glad that it's, you sort of go through stages because when someone does [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6002.92s)]
*  come, they really do, you know, you really do come. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6007.8s)]
*  I was just thinking of Bonnie Blue as soon as I see her. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6010.08s)]
*  I'll beat them too. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6014.52s)]
*  Maybe they'll be able to. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6016.32s)]
*  So what happens with, yeah, that is interesting. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6020.24s)]
*  You know, we're kind of done with the Connor era. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6023.5599999999995s)]
*  You know, he, like everybody was calling him out as the money fight and obviously it's [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6026.92s)]
*  going to change your life. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6031.2s)]
*  But I think now we've all realized that he's moving on, you know, and the sport is going [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6032.32s)]
*  to have to, it's no longer, I'm going to call out Connor. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6037.36s)]
*  I'm going to make that happen. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6039.5199999999995s)]
*  Do you feel that? [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6041.2s)]
*  Oh yeah, of course. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6042.2s)]
*  Yeah, like no one's even, yeah, you're right. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6043.2s)]
*  I don't think you're going to hear the call outs. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6044.599999999999s)]
*  And do we see him again? [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6046.639999999999s)]
*  What's the big money fight? [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6048.28s)]
*  Because it used to be Izzy, right? [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6049.32s)]
*  It's like everybody would call Izzy because you know, if you're fighting Izzy, you're [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6050.719999999999s)]
*  going to fucking make that money. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6053.04s)]
*  And you know, obviously Izzy's had an unfortunate last few fights and but like, who is the person [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6055.16s)]
*  that you call out now? [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6060.2s)]
*  Like not even you, like who is the guy? [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6061.639999999999s)]
*  John's out. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6063.719999999999s)]
*  Like we need to figure out who that. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6064.719999999999s)]
*  I mean, you could say Ilya would be that guy. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6067.04s)]
*  It's got to be Ilya, right? [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6069.16s)]
*  Yeah, so Ilya's right up there now. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6070.16s)]
*  You know, you still got your, you got Max Holloway. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6072.04s)]
*  I love Max. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6076.92s)]
*  And Dustin. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6077.92s)]
*  They're about a fight. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6079.56s)]
*  Obviously you got Gage in that as well. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6080.56s)]
*  That but I mean, if Max wins, does that put him back at top? [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6082.4400000000005s)]
*  Could you imagine a rematch at lightweight? [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6086.76s)]
*  I think that's a, that's a, between Max and Ilya. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6090.12s)]
*  Ilya at lightweight. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6093.72s)]
*  So that'd be a massive fight. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6095.36s)]
*  But again, you're going to get, I think the guys would be someone like Ilya because he's [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6097.84s)]
*  a champ, I guess. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6103.4s)]
*  So you know, it gives you a reason to, but then you probably got guys that'd be like, [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6104.4s)]
*  Yeah, fuck that. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6107.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't know if I want to fight him. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6108.5199999999995s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6109.5199999999995s)]
*  Like maybe you got guys that, me, I'll fight anybody. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6110.5199999999995s)]
*  We know. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6111.92s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6112.92s)]
*  That's how I am. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6113.92s)]
*  But not everyone's like that. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6114.92s)]
*  When you say that Ilya is a nice guy, after you fight somebody, and I'm talking about [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6115.92s)]
*  guys that you've beaten as well, is there like a, do you guys talk, like you had this [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6120.0s)]
*  interesting thing with Islam where like, it seemed like you guys had a kind of like cool [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6126.2s)]
*  relationship. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6130.799999999999s)]
*  Like your daughter says like, this is great thing. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6131.799999999999s)]
*  You could, you'd say. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6135.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6136.5599999999995s)]
*  That's the, that was a funny story as well. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6137.5599999999995s)]
*  But yeah, I get along with everyone. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6138.839999999999s)]
*  But yeah, there was, that's how we started sort of chatting. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6141.08s)]
*  Always good. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6144.799999999999s)]
*  Like after the fight, we ended up having like, we were at the same cafe, I think it was set [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6145.799999999999s)]
*  up for the photo. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6150.32s)]
*  Good marketing on their part because then they ended up going to be viral that photo. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6152.28s)]
*  But yeah, so that was funny because, I'll tell you the story then, with Ariane, you [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6156.839999999999s)]
*  know, kids, you know, they, when they're trying to go to go to sleep, they start, I need to [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6161.08s)]
*  get a toilet and you know, they start carrying on and then you're just like, look, just go [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6164.36s)]
*  to sleep, you know, it's bedtime. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6168.08s)]
*  Oh, I'm scared. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6169.08s)]
*  I'm like, what are you scared of, darling? [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6170.08s)]
*  Oh, what if someone breaks in? [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6171.799999999999s)]
*  I'm like, no one's going to break in. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6173.08s)]
*  And like, oh, what if someone breaks through the window? [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6174.599999999999s)]
*  And then I'm like at a stage where I'm like, I'm getting a bit cocky sort of. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6176.32s)]
*  I'm like, darling, I'm a UFC world champion. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6182.0s)]
*  If someone breaks in, I think I'll sort it out. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6186.5199999999995s)]
*  She goes, what if it was Islam Martial Arts? [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6188.28s)]
*  And I'm just like, oh, I never just cracked up and he got wind of it. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6191.4s)]
*  And then he ended up going, oh, you know, I'd never come to the house, you know, uninvited [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6195.04s)]
*  and then gave him dolls. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6198.5599999999995s)]
*  Now the girls absolutely love him. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6200.08s)]
*  You know, that's what that's. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6201.4s)]
*  That's almost worse. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6202.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6203.5199999999995s)]
*  But with Ilya, so, mate, like, she's a hater. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6206.5199999999995s)]
*  My oldest, Ariane. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6210.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6211.28s)]
*  Like with Ilya, I'm like, I'm darling. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6212.28s)]
*  Like she's always saying stuff, like, I guess, you know, for losing. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6213.28s)]
*  I'm like, I bet you if he buys you a doll, you're gonna be best friends again. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6217.24s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6221.36s)]
*  But I think she's growing on him now. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6222.36s)]
*  But like, she'll get like that. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6224.88s)]
*  Obviously, she loves her daddy, you know. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6226.84s)]
*  And he took daddy's belt. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6229.08s)]
*  So that's how she looks at it. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6230.679999999999s)]
*  So she's a little bit more. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6231.679999999999s)]
*  But now I've got it back. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6233.08s)]
*  I think she's sort of easing up on him. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6234.08s)]
*  But you guys, you guys have spoken afterwards. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6236.24s)]
*  You say he's a respectful guy. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6238.76s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6239.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6240.76s)]
*  So yeah, man, like, we were even chatting a bit before. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6241.76s)]
*  Obviously, we were saying things. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6243.12s)]
*  I'm like, I hear cool. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6244.12s)]
*  And you'd be surprised, man. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6245.12s)]
*  Some people still go, look, you know, all respect. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6246.24s)]
*  Things might be said, but nothing but respect, you know. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6249.0s)]
*  So that's sort of how it's going to go a lot of the time. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6251.36s)]
*  And yeah, as we're going, you know, the camera's rolling, you're still, you know, saying your [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6254.36s)]
*  things but shaking hands with all respect. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6259.08s)]
*  And then after the fight, man, like, it's just nothing but respect, really. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6261.96s)]
*  Really? [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6265.72s)]
*  He's actually, yeah, him and his brother, really, really respectful dude. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6266.72s)]
*  So yeah, again, I'm a nice guy. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6268.599999999999s)]
*  So I'll do that. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6270.639999999999s)]
*  And then still fight. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6272.24s)]
*  Everybody loves Hock. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6273.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6274.24s)]
*  So that's sort of where we're at. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6275.28s)]
*  That's tough. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6276.28s)]
*  It's probably not good because, you know, if I ever do get a chance to run it back. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6277.28s)]
*  Yeah, if I like win, because I obviously want to earn my shot at the title. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6282.4s)]
*  Sure. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6287.0s)]
*  And lightweight for me to go up. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6288.0s)]
*  So if I get a chance, it's at a position now where he's all like, man, I like him too much. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6289.639999999999s)]
*  I don't want to fight now. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6293.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm probably going to be able to fight. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6294.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6295.5599999999995s)]
*  Or maybe that's what you do. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6296.5599999999995s)]
*  No, maybe strategic. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6297.5599999999995s)]
*  You know. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6298.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, yeah. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6299.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6300.88s)]
*  It's not strategic, but I guess, yeah, I don't know. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6301.88s)]
*  It's a tricky one, but at the same time, I don't know if that's going to happen. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6305.72s)]
*  Every time one of your opponents thinks that you're playing mind games by being like a [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6309.64s)]
*  nice guy, I just want to remind them that you used to drink your own pee on Mondays. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6313.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6317.52s)]
*  So it's not. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6318.52s)]
*  Are you careful? [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6319.52s)]
*  Are you careful that was me that did that? [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6320.52s)]
*  Now it's not you. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6322.52s)]
*  I've seen it. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6323.52s)]
*  I've seen it. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6324.52s)]
*  I saw it happen. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6325.52s)]
*  I saw it happen. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6326.52s)]
*  I never did one. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6327.52s)]
*  You never did one. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6329.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6330.4800000000005s)]
*  I could tell you so many stories. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6331.4800000000005s)]
*  I won't because Indy's going to attach some stories. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6332.4800000000005s)]
*  Tell us. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6335.4800000000005s)]
*  Tell us. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6336.4800000000005s)]
*  When was last Manic Monday? [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6337.4800000000005s)]
*  When was that? [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6338.4800000000005s)]
*  Huh? [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6339.4800000000005s)]
*  When was the last Manic? [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6340.4800000000005s)]
*  I had a mad Monday for a... [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6341.4800000000005s)]
*  A mad Monday. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6342.4800000000005s)]
*  It was probably a good thing. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6343.4800000000005s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6344.4800000000005s)]
*  Like that's when you... [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6345.4800000000005s)]
*  Are UFC guys like not even close to as big partiers as the rugby guys? [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6346.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's probably not as close. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6348.92s)]
*  Was it Aussie Roos football or rugby? [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6350.92s)]
*  I mean, obviously, you know, what is it? [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6351.92s)]
*  Train hard, play hard. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6354.92s)]
*  You know, you're going to still get that, but it's just a whole other level. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6355.92s)]
*  Sometimes we're with rugby league and the football, I guess the team sports. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6359.36s)]
*  Are those all team sports like that? [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6362.36s)]
*  I think so. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6363.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6364.36s)]
*  It would be, yeah. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6365.36s)]
*  It's like... [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6366.36s)]
*  It simulates almost war in that like we accomplish this thing together and now, you know, to [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6367.36s)]
*  the victor go the spoils and for you guys spoils are pay all over you. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6371.2s)]
*  Most of us, I think, just drink, right? [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6375.5599999999995s)]
*  Like we accomplish something good. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6377.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, we'll have like some drinks or whatever. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6378.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, we just do that now, you know. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6380.5599999999995s)]
*  Did you have any of your buddies go, why did you share that with the world? [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6382.5599999999995s)]
*  No, because I didn't single anyone out. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6387.68s)]
*  So it's all right. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6389.68s)]
*  Well, there's always an opportunity now if you want. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6390.68s)]
*  Because they're like, oh, no, they just said it was you. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6392.68s)]
*  So it's all good. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6394.68s)]
*  That's why he doesn't need Bonnie Blue, dude. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6396.68s)]
*  He's got his own mouth, right? [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6398.68s)]
*  That's what you need. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6400.68s)]
*  OK, so you said you want Avluav next. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6403.68s)]
*  I just think, look, man, he's fighting Pico. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6406.68s)]
*  So we've got a couple of big fights. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6409.68s)]
*  Diego is fighting Silva. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6411.68s)]
*  So a couple of big fights. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6412.68s)]
*  Is that 100% Garrett? [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6414.68s)]
*  That's already locked in for September. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6415.8s)]
*  I thought that they were going to make... [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6417.8s)]
*  Who's the guy who does Taekwondo? [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6419.8s)]
*  Yair Rodriguez? [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6421.8s)]
*  Yeah, Yair. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6422.8s)]
*  I thought that they were going to do Yair versus... [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6423.8s)]
*  That's who they wanted me to... [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6425.8s)]
*  That sort of seemed like who I was going to fight. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6426.8s)]
*  Like because of the Mexico card, it was meant to be pay-per-view. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6428.8s)]
*  But then the stadium, they had a... [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6430.8s)]
*  Like something fell through and the stadium wasn't going to be ready. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6432.8s)]
*  So it's not a pay-per-view anymore. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6434.8s)]
*  So now it's a fight night. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6436.8s)]
*  So they've sort of just said, oh, we don't... [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6438.8s)]
*  Like, I don't know, they haven't pushed Yair now. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6440.8s)]
*  Me, I'll fight anyone like how I always am. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6442.8s)]
*  And that's what they were sort of mentioned. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6444.92s)]
*  And obviously he was doing the rounds. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6447.92s)]
*  What about you versus Marab? [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6449.92s)]
*  Marab? [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6452.92s)]
*  I mean, look, again, I'd fight anybody. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6454.92s)]
*  I know you would. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6456.92s)]
*  He's... [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6457.92s)]
*  We get along really well again. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6458.92s)]
*  I couldn't imagine. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6460.92s)]
*  You and him, we got to get both of you in a pod. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6461.92s)]
*  Because the two of you together, I think we'd be a manic Monday. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6463.92s)]
*  Oh, yeah, man. He's hilarious. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6466.92s)]
*  He's a fun guy, right? [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6468.92s)]
*  He's a ball of energy. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6470.92s)]
*  But he's a good dude. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6471.92s)]
*  Really, really good dude. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6472.92s)]
*  I mean, he's in a position where, you know, he's had a few defences. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6474.04s)]
*  He probably could move up soon, right? [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6477.04s)]
*  It'd be fair. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6479.04s)]
*  But at the same time, he's said, he's like, oh, no, I'd never fight Volk anyway. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6480.04s)]
*  Really? [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6484.04s)]
*  Yeah, he said that. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6485.04s)]
*  So I'm like... [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6486.04s)]
*  And he said that... [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6487.04s)]
*  It's good because I love the guy as well. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6488.04s)]
*  So even though you have to do it, you have to do it. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6490.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6492.04s)]
*  But him and Aljo were teammates, obviously. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6493.04s)]
*  But they also said that they would never fight each other. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6495.04s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6497.04s)]
*  I think there is a kind of, like, bond with friends. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6498.04s)]
*  I mean, you've got to respect that as well. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6500.04s)]
*  They were pressured a lot to fight and they ended up, you know, [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6502.16s)]
*  just didn't fall into it. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6506.16s)]
*  Aljomain even moved up a division to let him have his go. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6509.16s)]
*  Or he was even going to do that even while he was champion. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6512.16s)]
*  I think he was going to beat... [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6515.16s)]
*  If he beat Sean O'Malley, I think he was going to vacate [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6517.16s)]
*  so that Mirab can take it. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6520.16s)]
*  So, I mean, you've got to respect that in a sense [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6522.16s)]
*  because you are going to be talked into things sometimes. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6524.16s)]
*  And if you can stick to your guns and look how much has paid off for Mirab, [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6527.16s)]
*  maybe not so much Aljomain, like, you know, he's been... [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6531.28s)]
*  which he's a cool dude as well. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6535.28s)]
*  But Mirab, I just love seeing, like you said, good guys... [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6537.28s)]
*  Do well. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6540.28s)]
*  Do well. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6541.28s)]
*  And then now he's starting to get his flowers as well. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6542.28s)]
*  Everyone does his funny skits and that as well. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6544.28s)]
*  He's a cool ball of energy, [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6547.28s)]
*  so there's plenty of content out there of him. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6549.28s)]
*  He's good fun. He's a good dude. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6551.28s)]
*  What about O'Malley? [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6553.28s)]
*  I'm not making enemies with nobody. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6555.28s)]
*  I know. We've got to make some enemies. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6557.28s)]
*  Who wants to take my belt? [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6559.4s)]
*  Nah, you're too nice, man. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6561.4s)]
*  That's how you protect it, man. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6565.4s)]
*  Yeah, and then he goes, I go, hey. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6567.4s)]
*  But then there's no paychecks, you know? [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6569.4s)]
*  Yeah, we need the paychecks. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6571.4s)]
*  How many more paychecks you want? [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6573.4s)]
*  That's a question I've been trying to ask this whole time. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6575.4s)]
*  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6577.4s)]
*  No, I didn't want to know. Stop. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6579.4s)]
*  Yeah, look, man, it's a tricky one. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6581.4s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6583.4s)]
*  It's something that you are going to always think about. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6585.4s)]
*  I'm not going to lie to you and be like, [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6587.5199999999995s)]
*  oh, I've got heaps more left in me. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6589.5199999999995s)]
*  You know, that's not the case. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6591.5199999999995s)]
*  But I know it's not too far away [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6593.5199999999995s)]
*  where we probably will be hanging the gloves up. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6597.5199999999995s)]
*  But I've still got some fight left in me. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6599.5199999999995s)]
*  So we'll do that. We'll see each fight as it goes. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6602.5199999999995s)]
*  Three more, two more? [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6605.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, I felt great in the last camp. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6607.5199999999995s)]
*  You looked fantastic. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6609.5199999999995s)]
*  Exactly, man. I really took it serious. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6611.5199999999995s)]
*  I wouldn't do it as long. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6613.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, I've been in the long-ass camp. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6615.64s)]
*  But I would like to bring the weight down early. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6617.64s)]
*  I felt that was a great idea for me [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6619.64s)]
*  to bring the weight down early [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6621.64s)]
*  so I felt sharper early. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6623.64s)]
*  Because again, if I went through camp [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6625.64s)]
*  feeling a bit heavy and sluggish, [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6627.64s)]
*  was that going to get me thinking, [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6629.64s)]
*  oh, man, I'm feeling old, man? [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6631.64s)]
*  Was that going to happen? [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6633.64s)]
*  I was glad I didn't do that. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6635.64s)]
*  I felt right. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6637.64s)]
*  The first part of camp, I was doing really well. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6639.64s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6641.64s)]
*  It got me in a good headspace going through camp. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6643.76s)]
*  So I felt great. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6645.76s)]
*  So I'm like, oh, I've got a few left in me. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6647.76s)]
*  So we'll see. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6649.76s)]
*  If that drastically changes next camp, all right. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6651.76s)]
*  Maybe we'll think about it being earlier. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6653.76s)]
*  I think you're slowly going to find a hobby. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6655.76s)]
*  That's what's going to happen. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6657.76s)]
*  I'm cooking. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6659.76s)]
*  Cooking. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6661.76s)]
*  You don't bring anything, bro. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6663.76s)]
*  You could have brought some biscuits or some shit. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6665.76s)]
*  You're dieting? [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6667.76s)]
*  You got a train here. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6669.76s)]
*  I'm not breaking any news. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6671.88s)]
*  I'm not breaking any news here. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6673.88s)]
*  There's no broken news. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6675.88s)]
*  Some people have speculated [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6677.88s)]
*  that maybe Volk would also be in Street Fighter. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6679.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6681.88s)]
*  Obviously, I'm not saying anything. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6683.88s)]
*  We would never say something like that [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6685.88s)]
*  on a podcast that's going to go out to millions of people. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6687.88s)]
*  We would never share that kind of information here [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6689.88s)]
*  because we have contracts with the studios. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6691.88s)]
*  But listen, I told them, [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6693.88s)]
*  if you hire me for a movie, [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6695.88s)]
*  I'm going to say some shit and I probably shouldn't. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6697.88s)]
*  Don't let there be some fake kisses on screen. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6700.0s)]
*  Who would you hypothetically play? [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6704.0s)]
*  I'm a hypothetical one. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6706.0s)]
*  Who could I play? [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6708.0s)]
*  Who's a short bolthead fellow? [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6710.0s)]
*  Let's get the cast. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6712.0s)]
*  Let's see some pictures of these Street Fighters. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6714.0s)]
*  Joey, get us some stuff up. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6716.0s)]
*  That's all right. The movie. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6718.0s)]
*  Make you look tall. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6720.0s)]
*  Make you look like you've got nice blonde hair. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6722.0s)]
*  Whatever it is. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6724.0s)]
*  He wants to be Guile. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6726.0s)]
*  I've called Ryu Ryu my whole life. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6728.12s)]
*  I'm not switching to Ryu. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6730.12s)]
*  It's going to be Ryu. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6732.12s)]
*  Are we going to be a Rasenal? [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6734.12s)]
*  Are you going to be a Rasenal like that? [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6736.12s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to say... [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6738.12s)]
*  There's other things I'll call him too. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6740.12s)]
*  We've got Roman Reigns. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6742.12s)]
*  He's going to play Akuma. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6744.12s)]
*  That makes sense. That's great. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6746.12s)]
*  We've got... [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6748.12s)]
*  Felina Liang as Chun Li. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6750.12s)]
*  Jason Momoa is going to be Blanca. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6752.12s)]
*  Sick. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6754.12s)]
*  Orville Peck as Vega. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6756.24s)]
*  This is fire because he does wear a mask. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6758.24s)]
*  Do you guys remember the Vega character? [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6762.24s)]
*  But he actually does wear one. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6764.24s)]
*  He's a country music superstar. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6766.24s)]
*  So he's going to play Vega. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6770.24s)]
*  Why does he wear a mask? [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6772.24s)]
*  Say again? [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6774.24s)]
*  COVID. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6776.24s)]
*  He just wears the top part. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6778.24s)]
*  He's a patriot. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6780.24s)]
*  And then Noah Centineo as Ken. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6782.24s)]
*  None of us knew that Ken had a last name. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6784.36s)]
*  So it's good to know that he's going to be doing that. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6786.36s)]
*  Oh, okay. Ken Maher. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6788.36s)]
*  And then the boy! [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6790.36s)]
*  50% is ball-rung! [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6792.36s)]
*  They got 50 in Australia for two months! [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6794.36s)]
*  This ain't no Street Fighter. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6796.36s)]
*  Might be the best game ever. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6798.36s)]
*  It seems like they were just like, [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6800.36s)]
*  you want to be a Street Fighter? [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6802.36s)]
*  Everyone was like, fuck yeah. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6804.36s)]
*  The second they said it, I was like, yes. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6806.36s)]
*  And they were like, you're going to play this character. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6808.36s)]
*  He was pretty much a joke. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6810.36s)]
*  He was made just to make fun of another video game, [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6812.48s)]
*  he was trying to rip us off. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6814.48s)]
*  And I was like, still yes. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6816.48s)]
*  That's actually bad. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6818.48s)]
*  I basically played like Ken's manager. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6820.48s)]
*  Oh, hell yeah. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6822.48s)]
*  I'm like a scummy manager. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6824.48s)]
*  I don't want to give too much away from him. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6826.48s)]
*  But I will, because I have a microphone on me. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6828.48s)]
*  So I'm going to play Dan Hibiki. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6830.48s)]
*  So how are you training? [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6832.48s)]
*  You got to be shredded, right? [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6834.48s)]
*  So here's the thing, you tell me. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6836.48s)]
*  This is what I've... [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6838.48s)]
*  What do you need? [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6840.599999999999s)]
*  I need peptides. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6842.599999999999s)]
*  Steroids. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6844.599999999999s)]
*  I need to not cook with Volk for at least six weeks. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6846.599999999999s)]
*  I have four weeks to get in shape. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6848.599999999999s)]
*  To play a comedic character, [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6850.599999999999s)]
*  we'll never have his shirt off. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6852.599999999999s)]
*  But since everybody else, maybe Volk, [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6854.599999999999s)]
*  look at what this guy looks like. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6856.599999999999s)]
*  Go to that image. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6858.599999999999s)]
*  He had to lift the weights away. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6860.599999999999s)]
*  It's Pride Month. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6862.599999999999s)]
*  So, yeah, I'm just Pride Month right here. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6864.599999999999s)]
*  That's fire, dude. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6868.72s)]
*  That's a perfect idea. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6870.72s)]
*  Great casting. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6872.72s)]
*  Get out there, Tim. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6874.72s)]
*  You're going to get buff. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6876.72s)]
*  So this is what I'm thinking, okay? [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6878.72s)]
*  I don't think I could gain weight [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6880.72s)]
*  in six weeks. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6882.72s)]
*  But I think that, like, I'm looking at [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6884.72s)]
*  any movie character. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6886.72s)]
*  And I was talking to Jordan Shouse, [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6888.72s)]
*  talking to Muscle Doc, and he's like, [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6890.72s)]
*  Yo, Ryan Reynolds in Deadpool [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6892.72s)]
*  is 170 pounds. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6894.72s)]
*  I think what happens in movies, [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6896.84s)]
*  like, Brad Pitt in Fight Club [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6898.84s)]
*  was probably like 150 pounds. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6900.84s)]
*  So people look muscular, [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6902.84s)]
*  they're just skinny. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6904.84s)]
*  Probably just lean as well. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6906.84s)]
*  Shading, shadows. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6908.84s)]
*  That's what I'm saying, give me that 300. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6910.84s)]
*  They were just putting, [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6912.84s)]
*  so I'm going to get skinny [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6914.84s)]
*  and try to look shredded [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6916.84s)]
*  and then let them Photoshop [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6918.84s)]
*  some pecs on me or whatever. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6920.84s)]
*  But I'm going to do my best. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6922.84s)]
*  Anovar. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6924.96s)]
*  Also steroids. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6926.96s)]
*  You don't know anything about steroids. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6928.96s)]
*  You're a clean athlete. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6930.96s)]
*  They got rid of... [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6932.96s)]
*  I'm going to help you have a diet, cook a wee vodka, [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6934.96s)]
*  and help you with a diet. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6936.96s)]
*  Losing weight, I can help you with. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6938.96s)]
*  Putting on weight, not so good. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6940.96s)]
*  I had to do it, and I had to eat like 4,000 or 5,000 calories. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6942.96s)]
*  When you were playing rugby. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6944.96s)]
*  When I tried to fight Islam, [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6946.96s)]
*  I just put on weight. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6948.96s)]
*  Obviously, everything's natural. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6950.96s)]
*  I'm a major against. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6953.08s)]
*  You can do it. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6955.08s)]
*  If people want to do it in their own time, that's good. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6957.08s)]
*  But when it comes to competing. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6959.08s)]
*  If you want to do it for a movie scene, that's fine. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6961.08s)]
*  But when it comes to competing, I'm major against it. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6963.08s)]
*  I'm a big hater of it. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6965.08s)]
*  I was worried about taking steroids [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6967.08s)]
*  because it could affect your sperm. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6969.08s)]
*  Then I realized my sperm is already affected. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6971.08s)]
*  I have no loss. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6973.08s)]
*  You should be glowing, dude. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6975.08s)]
*  But then my wife was like, [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6977.08s)]
*  it will give us an unfair advantage in our fights. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6979.08s)]
*  Who's the armistice? [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6983.08s)]
*  I'm a Russian guy. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6985.08s)]
*  No, I'm going to... [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6987.08s)]
*  It's hard, man. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6989.08s)]
*  Zangief. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6991.08s)]
*  You could be Zangief. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6993.08s)]
*  I could see you play in Zangief. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6995.08s)]
*  Or M. Bison, see what he's got the beat. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6997.08s)]
*  I don't know if I'm big enough. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=6999.08s)]
*  Who are you going to play in Street Fighter? [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7001.08s)]
*  I know the other Street Fighter characters. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7003.08s)]
*  Dude, I've been pushing so hard for Volker in Street Fighter. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7005.08s)]
*  I've been pushing so hard. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7007.08s)]
*  You know what I sent the producers? [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7009.08s)]
*  I sent the producers [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7011.2s)]
*  Old Volk. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7013.2s)]
*  Oh. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7015.2s)]
*  I was like, listen, [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7017.2s)]
*  this guy can actually act. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7019.2s)]
*  Don't watch him in interviews at all. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7021.2s)]
*  If you give him a script, [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7023.2s)]
*  because that shit was funny. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7025.2s)]
*  Really funny. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7027.2s)]
*  You were actually acting. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7029.2s)]
*  I actually really enjoy it. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7031.2s)]
*  You've got to watch this. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7033.2s)]
*  The fighting he's going to do better than everybody. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7035.2s)]

*  Yeah, you're what if one of your parent is a citizen? [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7803.599999999999s)]
*  Then I think you're good. I think you're good. So at least one of your parents got to be citizens [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7807.88s)]
*  Now let me think about this rule is this rule that bad and do other countries operate in the same way the actual Supreme Court [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7812.719999999999s)]
*  ruling I think was that like you can't [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7820.179999999999s)]
*  An injunction only applies to the people that are suing [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7822.96s)]
*  So if people are suing president Trump for trying to sign this order and then a court says no [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7827.12s)]
*  We were like president Trump can't pass the order. We're gonna protect these people that are suing for now. It's only these people [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7832.66s)]
*  There's no like precedent beyond the people that are actually suing got it [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7838.6s)]
*  And then it would be state to state and I think what they're trying to say is [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7842.200000000001s)]
*  Non-us citizens who have kids don't get automatic citizenship now not just the kids do the kids get citizenship [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7847.120000000001s)]
*  No, they do not just because you're born here if you're born to a non-us citizen. I [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7854.0s)]
*  Assume one of them is a citizen. You're okay, but if it's too non you know that includes visas [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7858.120000000001s)]
*  I think that includes like a lot of part of me. That's like [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7863.160000000001s)]
*  I don't know if it's that crazy because there are people who will just get pregnant and then month seven come to America [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7866.08s)]
*  You can stay here for three months on a tourist visa and then you have a kid that's born here [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7873.36s)]
*  And then they have American citizenship and they're taking advantage of American citizenship [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7877.8s)]
*  Obviously, yeah, and they're not only people that are coming from third world countries [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7881.32s)]
*  We're talking about people coming from Europe just so they can stack on [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7885.0s)]
*  Okay, so our people who are here legally but on a visa so they're not a citizen, but they're working [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7888.68s)]
*  Visa I can't you be a citizen. Yeah, if you're here on a work visa, we all look at your work [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7894.92s)]
*  Are you doing good work? [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7900.4400000000005s)]
*  Yes, yeah, hey, hey, hey, it's like a corporate indentured servitude [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7903.68s)]
*  I feel like if you're working here [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7911.76s)]
*  Yeah, if you're working here and then your your partner is also on a visa [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7913.76s)]
*  So you're both working here and then you have a kid then yeah that kid [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7920.44s)]
*  She's on a board visa and you're allowed to bring your partner that kid if the kid is born here [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7923.88s)]
*  I think you should be a citizen [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7927.92s)]
*  I don't think it's crazy to people who just like come here when they're nine months pregnant to have a baby [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7928.88s)]
*  And then yeah, I'm not super mad at that and I get the idea that someone comes here illegally and then has a kid [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7932.88s)]
*  Why is that kid and then their whole family gets a say? [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7937.84s)]
*  Like I get that's so the shitty part is don't take it away. Just refine it [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7940.4s)]
*  So what's the best version of it? [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7945.36s)]
*  I think like what we said like I think if you're here on why people get to do it [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7947.28s)]
*  Why people get to do it? That's the best version. Yeah, and Nigerians and Indians. That's it. Oh, that's odd [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7951.72s)]
*  Yeah, the best of the world. Yeah the best [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7957.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's true because you want to create a system where the best people from all over the world want to come here [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7961.84s)]
*  But also to gap up the loopholes that they can't just exploit the system and come over nine months [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7966.5199999999995s)]
*  This was a loophole gap in the beginning [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7972.08s)]
*  Well, I think wasn't this so to make it so that [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7973.96s)]
*  Children of slaves were considered American citizens. I believe it was the 14th amendment [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7978.32s)]
*  so like the idea was that you know, you are a citizen of the United States of America and [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7983.28s)]
*  I [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7989.56s)]
*  Believe that there are legals that are taking advantage of that rule that was put in place to give citizenship to [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7990.8s)]
*  13th amendment stopped shadow slavery and then the 14th amendment was basically like how do we make these people citizens? [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=7996.68s)]
*  Yeah, and the 14th was birthright. Well what I would what I so here's this is this is actually a really interesting point [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8001.84s)]
*  So I hate you [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8009.12s)]
*  For what reason? [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8011.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, yeah, so here's so maybe here's a good option like [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8021.6s)]
*  If you want to gain citizenship through your if you want your kid to be a citizen [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8025.4800000000005s)]
*  But you're illegal you have to be a slave for a little [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8032.08s)]
*  Because that is the 14th amendment [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8036.6s)]
*  If you're gonna use the 14th amendment, which was specifically put in place so that the kids of slaves would get citizenship [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8039.16s)]
*  You are using that without going through the slaving [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8046.28s)]
*  So if you slave it up a little bit, then it should apply to you and your family [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8049.56s)]
*  But if you're doing it without the whole purpose of it [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8053.7s)]
*  Yeah, then it feels like you're taking advantage of the system Al would you like to speak on this? [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8057.12s)]
*  And keep in mind that you might get some Serbian slaves out of this [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8060.68s)]
*  You can get white slaves first thing I thought about [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8064.200000000001s)]
*  Racist toward black people to not make [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8069.52s)]
*  Fair you guys had to go through this right and then these other people don't have to go through it [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8072.4800000000005s)]
*  But then they get the citizenship they imagine the atrocities that you have to enjoy equality. I'm okay wanted [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8077.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, that's it slaves black slaves all slaves [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8082.02s)]
*  so we bring back slavery in an effort to naturalize the kids of [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8085.360000000001s)]
*  Illegals or things and then what is the term of slavery? [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8091.240000000001s)]
*  mmm seven years based on movies I've heard of [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8095.08s)]
*  I think it depends like what we need to get done. Like some of these projects like her [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8111.52s)]
*  Is gonna take a little while? Yeah. Yeah, what do we need done? [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8116.280000000001s)]
*  What are the big things we need done? We need housing. We need housing. We need them to build house [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8119.24s)]
*  That's the next that's the Mexicans all construction projects [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8123.679999999999s)]
*  Who is who are the best builders in the world? [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8127.4s)]
*  Like should they come here on an indentured servitude term and their kids that they do have end up becoming citizens [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8129.12s)]
*  I don't know if white people can be the the owners that feels too weird to me [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8136.0s)]
*  So I think it's only non whites can own the slaves like that [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8139.36s)]
*  I know and so it's y'all y'all can have slaves and that's kind of whatever you guys want to build [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8142.24s)]
*  We'll just bring ours from India we got that's what I'm saying [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8145.96s)]
*  This is [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8164.36s)]
*  Full circle moment takes a hundred years [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8167.08s)]
*  They see [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8170.0s)]
*  Can can we just have an acknowledgement of how racist you feel watching squid game when [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrT0NRCs_Y&t=8172.24s)]
