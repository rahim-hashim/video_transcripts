# Kendrick Fires Back & Schulz is Roasting Tom Brady
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [May 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU)
*  What's up everybody? Welcome to Flaygrant. I know you guys are tuning in so we can talk about what's happening in these protests at college campuses all over the world. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=0.0s)]
*  I know that's the discussion that you want to listen to. I know while you're sitting at work trying to get a little bit of distraction, you just want to hear about college kids. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  That's all you want. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=14.36s)]
*  Yeah, you just want to hear what they have to say about the world. You need that. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  You need it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=17.92s)]
*  You need that. But you know what we're going to talk about? LeBron James putting his white bitch in her place. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Because she was shook. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=23.8s)]
*  There's a great video, which I'm sure all you've seen, but I've never loved LeBron so much. That was his victory lap for me. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=25.599999999999998s)]
*  Awesome. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=32.08s)]
*  You know when you have that one season that Kobe had where everybody says goodbye? You can't beat that. You go out on top. That is LeBron going out on top for me. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=32.56s)]
*  Some white woman in the audience, these white ladies have gotten way too comfortable talking to athletes. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=41.4s)]
*  But like there's one thing about dudes talking to athletes because you're aware that after, you know, shout out to Ron Artest. Ron came to the show in L.A., by the way. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=46.92s)]
*  Oh, awesome. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=56.080000000000005s)]
*  And he's like the most sweet, adorable, kind guy. But I was hanging with him and I was like, you can go south. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  At any minute you say the wrong thing, boom. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=64.2s)]
*  You don't even have to say it. He could punish someone else. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=66.80000000000001s)]
*  That's it. That's it. So so so basically guys know now if you talk shit, there is a potential outcome where you get fucked up. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=68.36s)]
*  And women know that there is no or believe that there is no potential outcome. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=77.11999999999999s)]
*  And that moment right there was just precious. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=80.75999999999999s)]
*  Like he must have been so infuriated. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=83.92s)]
*  The girl's like five, six. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=85.92s)]
*  And he literally just goes, you can't even do that to your wife. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  Because she's doing this is so infuriating. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=91.6s)]
*  That is fucked up. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=93.64s)]
*  Like you're the greatest player on earth. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=94.0s)]
*  Arguably top two, maybe one ever. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=96.6s)]
*  And some fucking idiot girl is just doing this to you. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=99.08s)]
*  And it's like you don't even know basketball. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=101.56s)]
*  When did when did white chicks get so comfortable at basketball games? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=102.72s)]
*  So they've been dating all the players, I think. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=106.96s)]
*  Yeah, they messed me. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=108.48s)]
*  You know, that is funny. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=110.36s)]
*  Like maybe LeBron dropped a load on her back in the day and she's still upset about it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=112.12s)]
*  She finally worked her way back onto the front. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=115.72s)]
*  Like she's on the floor. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=118.2s)]
*  What a wasted ticket. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=119.92s)]
*  This is a closeout game. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=121.32s)]
*  And there's a lady that doesn't know the rules that is on the front. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=122.8s)]
*  Maybe she's the girl from that Jamal Murray video. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=126.67999999999999s)]
*  What is that? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=128.76s)]
*  The one where Jamal Murray is getting head. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=129.44s)]
*  We don't remember. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=131.24s)]
*  I thought it was Patrick Mahomes getting head. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=131.8s)]
*  No. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=133.8s)]
*  This whole time, I thought Patrick Mahomes' wife was the one that was doing that. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=134.52s)]
*  And I was like, I get it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=137.56s)]
*  I swear to God, I was like, I was like, she's a little bit, you know, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=139.72s)]
*  we watched it on the podcast. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=143.36s)]
*  No, I remember exactly. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=144.72s)]
*  She was getting crazy dome. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=145.88s)]
*  But my brain switched it to Patrick Mahomes. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  And any time she would be like a little bit too gregarious, I'd be like, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=150.56s)]
*  yeah, but the head is crazy. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  Alex Earl. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=155.96s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=157.16000000000003s)]
*  That's nuts. Anyway. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=158.28s)]
*  Yeah, we're not going to watch that shit in slow mo as well. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=161.12s)]
*  Anyway, so the fact that LeBron does this in most likely his final game. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=164.0s)]
*  I mean, he has a his career is stainless. Right. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=170.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. We always say like, there's not a single thing he's done wrong in his [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=173.48s)]
*  entire career. This is potentially his last game. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=176.2s)]
*  If he just Sparta kicked that girl in the chair, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=179.23999999999998s)]
*  would it would it diminish his reputation at all? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=184.12s)]
*  Or would it elevate elevate by a lot? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=186.44s)]
*  This is fantastic. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=188.51999999999998s)]
*  And think about what he would have done for us. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=189.28s)]
*  Now we don't have to bring our wives courtside. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  My wife actually asked me, my wife was like, hey, if you get courtside [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=193.84s)]
*  tickets, who are you going to bring? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=196.92000000000002s)]
*  And I looked at I was like, don't even. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  There's like a list of five people that are sitting next to me before you. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=201.52s)]
*  And like my dad, Jameel, Jason. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=205.36s)]
*  I have a doorman who likes the Knicks kind of like there's multiple people [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=209.24s)]
*  that I'm bringing before you guys. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=213.36s)]
*  Kind of. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=216.36s)]
*  This is not his last game because he's going to want to play with his son. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=218.32000000000002s)]
*  But this is maybe the tune up. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  And then last game with his son, Sparta kick right in the face. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=222.96s)]
*  See you later. Oh, my God. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=225.68s)]
*  Even the I was looking at the comments, even people who hate LeBron were like, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  no, I got to hand it to him. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=230.32s)]
*  That's just hilarious. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=231.36s)]
*  Because there's a scene also afterward, or there's a part of the video [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=232.24s)]
*  where he's looking at her, he calls her a scary ass. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=235.16s)]
*  He starts laughing at her and he he does this and then [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=237.36s)]
*  he like. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=240.32s)]
*  I'm trying to understand culturally, though, like, OK, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=244.56s)]
*  I understand women are more into sports and Caitlin Clark and the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=247.28s)]
*  NCAA. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=250.60000000000002s)]
*  Like everybody's blowing it up, right? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=251.8s)]
*  And don't get me wrong, being at a game is fun, even if you don't know the rules. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=253.60000000000002s)]
*  Like I would still enjoy going to a soccer game. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=256.8s)]
*  I don't know exactly what's going on. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=258.76s)]
*  I don't know the fucking place. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=260.0s)]
*  But I don't think I would be on the front lines [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=261.36s)]
*  talking shit because they can't get hit. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=265.04s)]
*  Dude, I watched the Super Bowl with some people. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=267.40000000000003s)]
*  Playoff time. It's crazy. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=268.88s)]
*  Anything goes play. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=270.64s)]
*  Well, what do you mean? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=271.56s)]
*  Like, I feel like everybody's talking shit. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  And so she's just trying to be like a fan. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  So it's mob mentality. Yeah. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  She realized. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=278.28000000000003s)]
*  So, yeah. So this is what's happening at the university. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=278.92s)]
*  You see it? We're back to it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=280.92s)]
*  We satisfied what you guys need from the pod. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=282.8s)]
*  OK, so you're just so caught up in it. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=287.0s)]
*  It's a home game. You're winning. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=288.72s)]
*  It's a closeout. Yeah. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=289.92s)]
*  And everybody else around you is talking shit. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=291.16s)]
*  So you start to think it's OK. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=292.84000000000003s)]
*  And there's no repercussions. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  Even when we do talk shit, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=296.32s)]
*  none of us have been close enough where it matters. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=298.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=300.12s)]
*  You're not climbing up to the 300s to get there. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=302.28000000000003s)]
*  It's fine. Yeah. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=305.32s)]
*  The shit talk should get more polite the closer you get. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=306.32s)]
*  Even though Rod Artes kind of went up into the stands. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=309.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=311.92s)]
*  He went to like Robbie like road test. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=312.92s)]
*  To get the motherfucker to beat that shit. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=318.24s)]
*  You're the wrong guy. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=319.96s)]
*  And then you're reading the article and you're like, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=320.96s)]
*  someone in the 100 aisle. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=322.64s)]
*  You're like, the 100. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=324.0s)]
*  Safe zone, right? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=327.0s)]
*  The 100s. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=328.8s)]
*  It threw that beer though. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=330.92s)]
*  Wasn't him it threw the beer. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=332.08s)]
*  But it was close enough for somebody to throw a beer. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=332.96s)]
*  I believe that there should be a guy as a little guy. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=335.08000000000004s)]
*  There's a line I don't cross because I could get fucked up. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=337.24s)]
*  And I'm aware of this at all times. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=340.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=342.12s)]
*  When no one has that governor, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=342.88s)]
*  that's when women are fucking doing that. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=344.88s)]
*  Arguably the greatest player of all time. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=347.04s)]
*  You need a fucking security. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  Should you do this? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=350.8s)]
*  What is going on inside? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=352.16s)]
*  This is the guy who's been so polished. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=354.08000000000004s)]
*  Like his image has been so curated and he has never really fucked up. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=356.04s)]
*  Like people saw him reading the book upside down or doing these things. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=360.08000000000004s)]
*  But all of those decisions he made were to put out the most perfect, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=363.96000000000004s)]
*  pristine products. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=367.64000000000004s)]
*  And in the final game, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=368.88s)]
*  there's some chunky white bitch that looks like the chick got kicked off the plane. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=370.72s)]
*  He's like, no, she's going to get the pump. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=375.64000000000004s)]
*  Because I think he was frustrated at the game. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=377.72s)]
*  The Denver Nuggets are just better. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=380.04s)]
*  No matter how well the Lakers play, the Nuggets just always seem to win. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=381.40000000000003s)]
*  And he was like, I'm fucking frustrated. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=384.88s)]
*  Raps aren't giving me the calls I want. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=387.36s)]
*  And this white bitch is talking to me. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=388.76s)]
*  You already got the dove coming, bitch. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=390.84000000000003s)]
*  You know, you know, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=392.76s)]
*  it's funny if she was black, he's not pumping. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=393.84s)]
*  No chance. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=396.47999999999996s)]
*  She wouldn't have flinched because she fight. Yeah. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=397.71999999999997s)]
*  You think Jordan would have done this? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=404.08s)]
*  Bro, I don't think. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=405.47999999999996s)]
*  Wait, let me let me actually back up. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=407.23999999999995s)]
*  Was Jordan so it's kind of become like trendy to hate [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=409.12s)]
*  LeBron a little bit among certain people. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=412.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=414.79999999999995s)]
*  Like I imagine her like, actually, hold up. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=415.32s)]
*  If she's like the wife of the owner, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=420.08s)]
*  I wonder if that gives her a little bit more leeway with the shit talk, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=422.56s)]
*  because like she's got a lot riding on this as well. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=425.92s)]
*  Hmm. OK, maybe not. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=429.36s)]
*  Let me see. Let me think. Let me think about it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=432.08s)]
*  If she was a wife of the owner, we also would have heard it by now. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=434.04s)]
*  True, true, true. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=436.12s)]
*  But it's become like socially trendy to like hate on LeBron, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=437.08s)]
*  like because the Internet exists, so all the opinions are out. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=439.92s)]
*  And then you don't feel alone with your opinion. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=442.48s)]
*  You're like, OK, I'm comfortable doing this. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=444.32s)]
*  Where back in the day, even if there was anti-Jordan sentiment, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=446.2s)]
*  where would it exist? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=451.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=452.67999999999995s)]
*  Sports Illustrated got tried it once and then they never got to interview again. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=453.0s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, really? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=456.76s)]
*  I didn't know. Oh, dude, when he played baseball, they had a cover story. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=457.64s)]
*  I said, bag it, Michael. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=461.2s)]
*  And it's like the greatest player ever is playing baseball. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=462.52s)]
*  Why or something like that? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=464.67999999999995s)]
*  And then he never did Sports Illustrated again. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=466.08s)]
*  That was when he was playing baseball. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=467.79999999999995s)]
*  He came back on three more chips and was like, you're getting nothing. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=469.28s)]
*  And at the time, Sports Illustrated was the biggest man. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=471.76s)]
*  I was like, everything. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=473.96s)]
*  I would argue Sports Illustrated was bigger than like [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=475.44s)]
*  any newspaper coverage on sports. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=478.52s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=480.92s)]
*  Like that. Yeah. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=481.71999999999997s)]
*  It's yeah. It's like, yeah, I don't even know what you would compare a magazine to now. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=482.88s)]
*  Like the biggest meme page. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=486.8s)]
*  Yeah. Bleacher Report. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=488.68s)]
*  OK. So and then ESPN is like, this guy's giving us all our views and ratings. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=490.76s)]
*  We're not shitting on him. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=494.24s)]
*  The NBA is going to protect. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=495.0s)]
*  So like, I don't know if anybody. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=496.8s)]
*  New Yorkers hated him because he would kill us. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=499.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. But outside of that, it was like. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=501.48s)]
*  And with no social media, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=505.64s)]
*  he he didn't have to like LeBron has to be out in front of the camera. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=507.24s)]
*  You know, protect the brand. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=510.92s)]
*  And we're so common. He didn't have to do any of that. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=512.08s)]
*  Yeah. So he could just fall back, say generic shit in interviews and get out. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=514.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And then you had no idea what he was really like. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=517.0s)]
*  Yes. All this sentiment existed for these people. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=518.6s)]
*  Like the same thing with Taylor Swift. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=520.84s)]
*  Like, I'm sure there's an artist back in the day, Michael Jackson, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=522.0400000000001s)]
*  that there's probably sentiment that existed for Michael. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=525.72s)]
*  But it couldn't really galvanize. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=528.44s)]
*  Yeah. Like where would it exist? Yeah. Yeah. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=530.24s)]
*  No, you know, a little bit is different. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=532.64s)]
*  Back in 90s was like real fouling. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=534.8s)]
*  Now they do a lot of the crying and pussy calls and stuff like that. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=538.76s)]
*  So that's what she was mocking for. The crying. Yeah. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=541.92s)]
*  They do flopping back in the day. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=544.52s)]
*  But flopping early 2000s, if you fail, you fail. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=545.8s)]
*  Early 2000s, there was flopping. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=549.6s)]
*  Rest in peace, Kobe would flop. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=551.3199999999999s)]
*  But it was like nobody cared. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=552.92s)]
*  You know, people would. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=554.08s)]
*  But you know what flopping came in the league when the Euros come in? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=555.92s)]
*  Thousand percent. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=558.96s)]
*  Dirk was my average. Even before Dirk. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=560.0s)]
*  Vlady. Vlady. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=562.56s)]
*  Oh, I hated that. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=563.92s)]
*  So like the Euros brought the. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=564.92s)]
*  Like from like soccer culture. Yeah. Oh, that's hilarious. Yeah. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=566.56s)]
*  Yeah. And it was effective. Yeah. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=568.84s)]
*  Like they would get calls and the refs didn't know what to do [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=570.4s)]
*  because they're seeing seven foot masculine men go like this. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=572.56s)]
*  And they're like, it must have been a foul. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=576.36s)]
*  Like no one would act gay on purpose. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=578.4399999999999s)]
*  This is the 90s. Yeah. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=580.6s)]
*  So they got every single call and they literally had to like [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=582.0s)]
*  reconfigure their brains. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=585.12s)]
*  Yeah. To how, you know, these players bodies would move. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=587.04s)]
*  You see Joel Embiid, who is like. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=590.28s)]
*  I mean, the guy is the most frustrating player to watch. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=593.96s)]
*  Fuck, Joel. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=596.4s)]
*  But here's like like that. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=597.48s)]
*  So here's the thing, I'll say two things. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=599.04s)]
*  He's the most frustrating player to watch because he does all the like [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=600.92s)]
*  annoying, like tries for foul shit that James Harden does. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=604.04s)]
*  But he's in slow motion. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=607.52s)]
*  So he's not interesting when he does it. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=609.72s)]
*  That being said, his IQ is out the fucking wazoo. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=612.2s)]
*  Like he's I've never seen a seven footer that has that type of game IQ. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=617.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like to be able to in a moment go, OK, I'm going for foul or OK, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=621.96s)]
*  I'm creating separation and shoot like it's he's annoying to watch [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=625.96s)]
*  and we're playing him and it drives me fucking crazy. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=629.0s)]
*  But I'm also like if he was on our team, I'd be like, well, that's fundamentals. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=631.2800000000001s)]
*  And he might be coming to your team and it would be perfect [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=637.08s)]
*  with Jalen Brunson in the fourth. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=638.9200000000001s)]
*  So I got to be very careful. Yeah. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=640.0s)]
*  But you got to clear that Bell's palsy up. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=641.8800000000001s)]
*  Motherfucker got a disease from the 1800s. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=643.5600000000001s)]
*  Did you hear this? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=647.4000000000001s)]
*  No, they're like, he goes, they go, half his face is paralyzed. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=648.0s)]
*  I think half his body may send this. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=651.5200000000001s)]
*  I should make some look meaner. I like that. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=653.5600000000001s)]
*  He touched it. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=657.0s)]
*  You got Harvey Dicks, right? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=657.72s)]
*  During the interviews, he's just me mugging niggas like, keep that up. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=659.4000000000001s)]
*  I like that. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=662.48s)]
*  Son, I saw him talking shit and then I saw you wear sketchers. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=663.12s)]
*  And I was like, now we can't lose a motherfucker to wear a sketchers. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=667.24s)]
*  Right. I should be heartbreaking. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=670.44s)]
*  Yeah, you can't do it. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=671.7600000000001s)]
*  You saw when he was on the floor and he like tried to grab dude. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=673.48s)]
*  Yeah, that shit was a little crazy. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=677.28s)]
*  No, he should be kicked out for that. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=678.88s)]
*  Yeah. Mitchell Robinson, who sat out last game because of it, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=680.12s)]
*  like jumped up and he grabbed me, kind of like bent his leg. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=684.4s)]
*  He had a couple of flagrants. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=687.28s)]
*  Like, that's crazy. Yeah. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=688.4s)]
*  But they don't want to ruin the season. Yeah, I know. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=690.36s)]
*  And that would be the fucking series for sure. Yeah. But [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=691.96s)]
*  you know, it's terrifying. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=696.84s)]
*  We're going to close it out tonight. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=697.72s)]
*  Yo, Nick, that's right. We're recording this on Tuesday right now. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=698.8000000000001s)]
*  Nick, I keep doing what you're doing. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=701.04s)]
*  I'm not ever going to refer to you as a Knicks fan. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=702.6s)]
*  You're a Knicks fan. You had season tickets. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=704.6800000000001s)]
*  This guy is a fucking loser. He's such a fucking loser. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=706.36s)]
*  I hate him so much. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=709.4s)]
*  You've had season tickets, unattended seats for years. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=710.76s)]
*  But fuck both of you guys. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=713.64s)]
*  Fuck you more, though. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=716.0400000000001s)]
*  At least he had season tickets. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=717.44s)]
*  What was the last time you showed up before this? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=718.6s)]
*  He's rich. What the fuck? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=720.2s)]
*  Go to the 300. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=722.6s)]
*  How many great contests you've been to in the last three years? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=723.9200000000001s)]
*  How many? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=725.96s)]
*  I mean, 17 great contests. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=726.84s)]
*  Is that a single Nick game? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=729.36s)]

*  So funny. Was open for me. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=735.88s)]
*  He was like, yo, I went to the Drake concert. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=737.24s)]
*  I saw Al. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=739.4000000000001s)]
*  This N-word knew every word to every Drake song that came on. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=741.0s)]
*  He had his nails painted. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=744.5200000000001s)]
*  I was like, I don't know this N-word. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=745.84s)]
*  I think it was there too. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=749.48s)]
*  So I'll say. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=750.48s)]
*  Yeah, but you're a Drake fan. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=752.2800000000001s)]
*  I'm a Drake fan. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=754.08s)]
*  Kudos to you. You're not a Knicks fan. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=754.96s)]
*  I'm a Knicks fan. I went to two Knicks games. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=756.44s)]
*  One was in L.A. One was here. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=758.96s)]
*  You're a fucking loser. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=762.68s)]
*  No, but this season I went to two games. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=763.56s)]
*  That's more than you did, more than he did. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=765.28s)]
*  No, I'm not a Knicks fan. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=767.24s)]
*  All right, so boom. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=768.96s)]
*  Listen, we're busy. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=772.08s)]
*  And also, you know, this is a tricky one this year. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=772.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=776.2s)]
*  This is a tricky one. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=777.2s)]
*  They're going to close out today. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=778.0s)]
*  They're going to close out today. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=779.12s)]
*  Third game of the season. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=780.08s)]
*  You know, as funny as it. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=781.12s)]
*  So we got the shows this weekend, obviously, MSG. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=782.2s)]
*  And I remember when I was booking the shows, they said, listen, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=784.68s)]
*  there's a chance that the Knicks make a late playoff run that [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=787.48s)]
*  you could potentially get bumped out of your dates. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=791.2s)]
*  Is that a risk you're willing to take? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=793.88s)]
*  And I remember saying to the to the person at MSG on the phone, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=796.0400000000001s)]
*  I go, I've been a Knicks fan my whole life. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=799.52s)]
*  I've never been more comfortable with this. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=801.88s)]
*  I said, book the goddamn shows. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=803.52s)]
*  Ain't no fucking way. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=807.9200000000001s)]
*  Oh, my God. Some six foot Lyskyn [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=809.0s)]
*  motherfucker is going to come in and drop 50 every goddamn game. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=811.08s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=814.6800000000001s)]
*  Bro, my mom called me. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=815.44s)]
*  She was like, yes. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=816.48s)]
*  So I see that like the there's a playoff game on the same day as the show. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=817.1600000000001s)]
*  Like, what's up with that? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=820.4s)]
*  And I was like, oh, well, like they have it like double booked [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=821.4399999999999s)]
*  because if the game doesn't happen, then the show happens. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=823.52s)]
*  I don't know. And she goes, so like the games are just rigged. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=825.1999999999999s)]
*  I love it. I love it. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=829.56s)]
*  She's like, well, like they are. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=831.4s)]
*  They already know the outcome of the games because they're not going to. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=832.28s)]
*  Like, it makes no sense. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=834.68s)]
*  I love it. Two things on the same day. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=835.4399999999999s)]
*  Like once you believe that [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=837.04s)]
*  everything is conspiracy, everything does become she got a good point. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=839.3199999999999s)]
*  It's a great point. I was like, are you fucking right? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=842.4s)]
*  I mean, it is rigged to the point that Joel and B didn't get kicked out [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=844.72s)]
*  the fucking series immediately after injured. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=848.28s)]
*  And you saw him kick homeboy as well. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=850.3199999999999s)]
*  I was felt that was dirty. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=852.92s)]
*  That's just like some rough play. That was cool. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=854.68s)]
*  The nut kick. Yeah. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=857.4s)]
*  And not crazy. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=859.0s)]
*  I think like a hard foul or like I'm OK with but a nut kick is weird. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=859.92s)]
*  Like I don't think he was strictly going for the nuts. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=864.0799999999999s)]
*  He was just trying to create contact. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=866.28s)]
*  Yeah. Just hit him a little bit. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=867.92s)]
*  I don't know. That's playoff ball. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=869.52s)]
*  But the shit on the floor like that, he could have heard him. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=871.4s)]
*  And then that would have fucked our whole season. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=873.92s)]
*  Son, I love it when New York is. Yeah. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=876.28s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=878.32s)]
*  Now, the city I've never lived here when the Knicks were good. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=879.64s)]
*  It's the city is going to be. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=882.12s)]
*  I remember Lynn Sanity, the city was buzzing. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=883.76s)]
*  Bro, that was all the only taste. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=885.6800000000001s)]
*  I was not punching Asians for two weeks. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=887.72s)]
*  Wow. Really? Yep. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=889.72s)]
*  Yeah. There was a combo. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=892.0s)]
*  But not Lynn Sanity was crazy. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=897.6800000000001s)]
*  It's it's really because outside of like Puerto Ricans and Dominicans, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=899.2s)]
*  the only sport all of us play growing up is basketball. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=903.88s)]
*  And Puerto Ricans and Dominicans will hoop a little bit, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=907.48s)]
*  but usually they play baseball. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=909.3199999999999s)]
*  White people in New York don't play anything but basketball. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=910.72s)]
*  Black people don't play nothing but basketball. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=913.48s)]
*  That's the only sport. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=915.28s)]
*  I've never heard a high school football conversation in New York. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=916.52s)]
*  Soccer isn't even there. Yeah. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=918.88s)]
*  So the whole city only cares about one thing. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=920.76s)]
*  So it is the closest, in my opinion, to like Europeans with football. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=924.16s)]
*  And that there's one sport that the city cares about. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=930.2s)]
*  Whereas like when you start going down south, they like football, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=934.28s)]
*  they play golf. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=937.4s)]
*  There's all these other activities that people can play. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=939.64s)]
*  Yeah. I don't even think New Yorkers fuck with baseball like that that much. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=941.72s)]
*  I think when the Yankees win, it's mostly people from like [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=945.6800000000001s)]
*  Long Island and Jersey to come down. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=948.92s)]
*  The one pushback I'll give you, your point stands. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=951.48s)]
*  But in terms of having something else to root for, like in Alabama, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=953.96s)]
*  the only thing they can possibly root for is college football. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=957.36s)]
*  Alabama, you know, I think I think that is like soccer in Europe. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=960.76s)]
*  Yeah. And they play everything, but that's all we have to root for. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=964.8000000000001s)]
*  And specifically, like they might not even know the players on the team. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=968.48s)]
*  But they love the team. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=973.52s)]
*  And in Europe, they might not even know the players on the team. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=974.88s)]
*  But they love it. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=978.24s)]
*  Might not be a good team. It don't matter. Third division. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=979.08s)]
*  Brian Simpson, Chalice of Brian, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=982.76s)]

*  the asshole army, to roast Tom Brady, man. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1256.04s)]
*  That next week. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1259.2s)]
*  It's gonna be crazy. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1260.04s)]
*  That's fire, I'm excited for that one. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1261.16s)]
*  That's gonna be cool. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1262.72s)]
*  You ready? [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1263.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1264.4s)]
*  I saw Tony working some shit out at Mothership. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1266.68s)]
*  Oh good, yeah, yeah. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1269.24s)]
*  Tony's gonna be there. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1270.52s)]
*  There's gonna be Kevin Hart's hosting it. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1271.68s)]
*  There's gonna be a bunch of other people there. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1273.64s)]
*  They told me, they told me I can't really talk about. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1275.76s)]
*  I feel like everyone's gonna be there. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1280.56s)]
*  If Tom Brady's getting roasted, with like. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1281.8s)]
*  How hard are you going? [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1283.84s)]
*  Here's the thing, I'm, yeah, it's gonna be fun. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1285.96s)]
*  It's gonna be fun. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1288.16s)]
*  How hard, how hard? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1289.48s)]
*  No, no, it's gonna be fun. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1290.32s)]
*  It's gonna be fun. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1291.84s)]
*  It's, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's live. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1292.68s)]
*  Yeah, buddy. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1296.4s)]
*  So you just, you know, you go for it. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1297.3600000000001s)]
*  I think it's a horrible decision by Netflix. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1299.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I've told them this. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1303.44s)]
*  It's just like, with roast, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1304.6s)]
*  you're gonna have fucking NFL players reading. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1306.36s)]
*  Like that's never a good combo. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1308.6799999999998s)]
*  So it's just like, why would you do this live? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1310.1999999999998s)]
*  You film it, then edit it down to the best version, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1313.36s)]
*  and then put it out. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1316.7199999999998s)]
*  They're doing a few live things. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1317.7199999999998s)]
*  They really are leaning into the live. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1318.8799999999999s)]
*  Cat Williams special's gonna be live, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1320.36s)]
*  which I think Cat will knock that out of the park, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1321.6799999999998s)]
*  but still, like Chris Rock walked off upset [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1323.28s)]
*  when he saw the live. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1326.24s)]
*  He was upset about a couple lines he fucked up. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1327.08s)]
*  Why not just edit? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1328.8s)]
*  Yeah, but for their argument for the rock thing, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1329.6399999999999s)]
*  it was like the most viewed thing that they've ever had. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1332.56s)]
*  And then, so I understand where they're coming from. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1335.44s)]
*  Like there's gonna be excitement, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1337.8s)]
*  but I also think like Tom, roasting Tom in general [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1339.0s)]
*  is just gonna be such a crazy thing [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1342.44s)]
*  that people would watch that you could film it [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1344.16s)]
*  and then put it out a week later, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1346.24s)]
*  and it wouldn't make any difference. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1348.2s)]
*  My opinion. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1351.04s)]
*  But yeah, it'll be fun. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1352.04s)]
*  Now they got me going last, which is the worst position. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1353.6399999999999s)]
*  It's not like, so here's the thing. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1356.28s)]
*  It's respectful. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1361.6399999999999s)]
*  I'm like, oh, that's cool, but I don't care to go last. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1364.2s)]
*  I'm not like, you gotta put me at the end. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1367.0800000000002s)]
*  The reason why you don't wanna go last [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1368.96s)]
*  is because you lose jokes throughout the whole thing. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1370.1200000000001s)]
*  Lisa Lambanelli talked to me about this. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1371.96s)]
*  I randomly talked to her backstage at a show [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1373.64s)]
*  for a couple hours, and she said, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1375.2s)]
*  when she was going last at the roast, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1376.2s)]
*  and she's like, so many comics wouldn't wanna go last, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1377.88s)]
*  so I would have to. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1380.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, no comic wants to go last. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1380.92s)]
*  Think of all the jokes that are getting done. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1382.5600000000002s)]
*  She's like, you have your list and you're just scratching. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1384.16s)]
*  You invariably are scratching off so many jokes. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1386.4s)]
*  You're like, well, I can't do that. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1388.8400000000001s)]
*  Or they hit the same Giselle joke 50 times or whatever, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1390.0400000000002s)]
*  and you're like, well, fuck, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1393.44s)]
*  now I gotta do something different. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1394.28s)]
*  So are you talking with the other comedians [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1395.52s)]
*  in terms of what bars they got? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1397.3600000000001s)]
*  I think that that should be what the show does, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1399.3200000000002s)]
*  but there's no real process for that, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1402.0s)]
*  and then people don't really share. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1403.76s)]
*  The comedians aren't gonna be honest. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1404.96s)]
*  They're gonna keep their shit in the tub. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1405.96s)]
*  If I was doing it, I would have everybody submit [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1407.04s)]
*  to an entity what you're gonna do, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1411.52s)]
*  and then that entity would filter out and make a decision [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1414.72s)]
*  and be like, hey, there's crossover here, let's not. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1418.48s)]
*  That would make the best show, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1421.04s)]
*  especially if you're gonna do live, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1422.2s)]
*  but it doesn't seem like there's that process. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1423.64s)]
*  And also, obviously, the players are all gonna have [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1426.24s)]
*  the things they say, but keep in mind, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1428.88s)]
*  it's different than just doing a stand-up show. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1430.52s)]
*  When you do a stand-up show, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1432.32s)]
*  you just talk about all the different topics. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1433.24s)]
*  You're just talking about the motherfuckers on the dais, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1435.72s)]
*  and this is gonna be long. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1438.32s)]
*  But at the same time, it's Tom for motherfucking Brady. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1441.3600000000001s)]
*  It's a pretty sick thing to do. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1443.28s)]
*  Where is it gonna be? [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1445.16s)]
*  The Forum. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1446.28s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1447.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1447.96s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1448.8s)]
*  I thought it was like a theater. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1449.96s)]
*  How many times are you gonna perform [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1451.1200000000001s)]
*  at the Forum this year, dog? [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1452.16s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1453.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1454.2s)]
*  That's fire. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1455.04s)]
*  So, no, it's cool. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1455.88s)]
*  You have any bar that didn't make the cut [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1456.88s)]
*  that you could tell us here? [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1459.24s)]
*  Nothing that I'm thrown out yet, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1462.3600000000001s)]
*  because again, I don't know where shit will be. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1464.16s)]
*  I have a set that I've been working out, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1465.8400000000001s)]
*  and it's like, I almost kinda wanna, no matter what, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1468.24s)]
*  release the set, because I'll probably have to scratch shit [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1472.64s)]
*  off as we go through, but there's a version [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1476.32s)]
*  where it's just like, this is fire. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1478.96s)]
*  I want y'all to see this. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1481.44s)]
*  So I might film it or release it or something like that. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1482.28s)]
*  I've heard it's crazy. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1486.0s)]
*  I talked to a buddy of mine that was at the Cellar [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1486.84s)]
*  about how much he ran it. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1488.08s)]
*  He was like, bro. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1489.4s)]
*  It's wild, bro. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1491.24s)]
*  Counterattack shit. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1492.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1493.72s)]
*  I mean, let's hope that we get there [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1494.56s)]
*  and there's still jokes. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1495.88s)]
*  I'm excited for it. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1497.76s)]
*  I'm excited for it. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1499.16s)]
*  Cool weekend, busy ass motherfucking weekend, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1500.0s)]
*  but we're gonna be good. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1501.8s)]
*  And then you're gonna be out there, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1503.16s)]
*  and you're gonna be out there for the fest. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1504.2s)]
*  So, yeah. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1505.64s)]
*  Improvs, both shows sold out. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1506.88s)]
*  Got them. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1508.3600000000001s)]
*  Thank y'all so much for HGL. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1509.2s)]
*  And then Mark. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1510.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna be doing my buddy Kid Super's show. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1511.24s)]
*  Hell yeah, dog. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1512.56s)]
*  Kid Super's doing the Paris Fashion Week fashion show [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1513.3999999999999s)]
*  for Netflix. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1516.52s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1517.3999999999999s)]

*  after the Kid Super Show. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1737.14s)]
*  In the dress, though. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1738.38s)]
*  Show up in the dress. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1739.22s)]
*  Me and Tom in the dress. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1740.0600000000002s)]
*  All right, what do we got? [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1742.5800000000002s)]
*  What do we got? [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1743.42s)]
*  Yeah, I know, bro. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1744.26s)]
*  Why they do this? [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1745.22s)]
*  Why they put black men in dresses? [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1746.0600000000002s)]
*  Back to the show. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1747.8200000000002s)]
*  Okay, guys, we have an official rap beef. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1748.94s)]
*  Finally. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1752.26s)]
*  It's happened. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1753.14s)]
*  Kendrick Drag, I'm such a prisoner of the moment, bro. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1754.42s)]
*  I'm such a prisoner of the moment. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1757.8200000000002s)]
*  I love this. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1759.1000000000001s)]
*  Bro, I'm such like. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1759.94s)]
*  I love this. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1760.7800000000002s)]
*  The last thing I hear is the best thing I heard. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1761.6200000000001s)]
*  And I put that shit on today. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1764.5400000000002s)]
*  I don't even know what he said. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1768.94s)]
*  I don't even know. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1771.26s)]
*  He's got the voice breaking and whatever. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1772.34s)]
*  You know that thing where he does the puberty shit? [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1774.86s)]
*  And I'm like. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1776.5s)]
*  The puberty shit. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1777.34s)]
*  Whatever it is. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1778.58s)]
*  When your voice cracks a little, right? [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1779.42s)]
*  And he's just. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1781.54s)]
*  I've seen this. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1782.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1783.7s)]
*  I've seen this. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1784.54s)]
*  Right? [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1785.3799999999999s)]
*  But he had some bars that I don't remember that were fire. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1786.22s)]
*  Like, I don't remember nothing, but it was he. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1789.46s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1792.5s)]
*  Okay, so the beginning starts. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1793.58s)]
*  It literally just dropped like about an hour ago. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1795.3s)]
*  We ain't really taken in that much. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1797.82s)]
*  But yeah, there were a couple bars that stuck out. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1799.8999999999999s)]
*  The first one. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1803.2199999999998s)]
*  Which one? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1804.4599999999998s)]
*  The one. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1805.3s)]
*  He said the shit in reverse. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1806.1399999999999s)]
*  If you play the intro backwards, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1807.6999999999998s)]
*  it says everything they say about me is true. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1809.86s)]
*  I believe. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1813.86s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1814.6999999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1815.54s)]
*  You're right. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1816.3799999999999s)]
*  So let's just start with that. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1817.1999999999998s)]
*  Does that mean like the family stuff that he mentioned? [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1818.02s)]
*  Does that mean? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1821.82s)]
*  Well he said fabricate stories on the family front. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1822.6599999999999s)]
*  So that's what's weird. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1824.1399999999999s)]
*  So then what is it? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1826.1399999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1826.9799999999998s)]
*  I think it says if you don't say lies about me, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1828.82s)]
*  I won't say truths about you. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1830.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1832.06s)]
*  Fire bar. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1832.8999999999999s)]
*  That was a nice one. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1833.72s)]
*  Now he knows something. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1834.56s)]
*  Is he saying that about Drake? [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1835.6599999999999s)]
*  Everything they say about me is true? [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1837.02s)]
*  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1841.06s)]
*  Okay, just so we can, just so, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1843.6599999999999s)]
*  what you mean is he's not saying that as Kendrick. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1845.62s)]
*  He's like. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1848.02s)]
*  Yeah, as Drake. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1848.86s)]
*  Wait, is it in Drake's actual voice [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1849.7s)]
*  or is it in Kendrick's voice? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1851.62s)]
*  I thought it was Kendrick's voice. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1852.82s)]
*  I love this. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1855.26s)]
*  You had to be a detective. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1857.06s)]
*  This combines conspiracy theories and rat beef [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1859.02s)]
*  and it's so fun. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1861.62s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1862.4599999999998s)]
*  Okay, so go. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1863.28s)]
*  I'm calling bullshit on the [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1864.12s)]
*  don't make me talk about your truth stuff [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1865.6999999999998s)]
*  because this is fucking six minutes and 40 seconds. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1867.58s)]
*  Like you said everything you could say. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1870.54s)]
*  This is too long for you to still have stuff [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1872.9399999999998s)]
*  left in the tuck to say. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1875.4599999999998s)]
*  Okay, but. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1877.1599999999999s)]
*  I think this is everything. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1878.74s)]
*  But it's more fun to think what. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1879.86s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1881.1399999999999s)]
*  No, no, definitely. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1881.98s)]
*  Are we thinking, there's no way a body [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1882.98s)]
*  or is there a body that he knows about? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1886.9399999999998s)]
*  If it turns out Drake really killed XXXTentacion. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1889.2199999999998s)]
*  I mean that's crazy. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1892.2199999999998s)]
*  There's no way, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1893.1399999999999s)]
*  because the kids would have ratted already. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1893.98s)]
*  Not really. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1898.06s)]
*  They're holding it down, 18 year old kids. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1898.8999999999999s)]
*  I mean Dave. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1900.54s)]
*  What? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1903.06s)]
*  I don't think Drake contacted the 18 year old kids. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1903.8999999999999s)]
*  I think if anything it was somebody told somebody [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1906.82s)]
*  told somebody to make that up. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1910.54s)]
*  And then they know that there's a. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1911.3799999999999s)]
*  But I still don't think, yeah. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1912.78s)]
*  I don't think they're behind it. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1914.1799999999998s)]
*  I don't think, so here's what I'll say to you Al. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1915.46s)]
*  He's kind of insinuating things, but he's not saying anything. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1918.1s)]
*  I think what he's saying is I'll do the push of teeth. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1921.6599999999999s)]
*  Have you ever paid 500, go up a little. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1923.8999999999999s)]
*  Have you ever paid 500,000 to like an open case? [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1926.06s)]
*  What does that mean Al, an open case? [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1930.1s)]
*  Well I have and I've failed at both. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1933.74s)]
*  I've failed at both. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1936.26s)]
*  Have you ever played, have you ever. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1937.1s)]
*  I think he said I've failed at both. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1937.94s)]
*  I think that's what. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1940.06s)]
*  Have you ever played? [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1940.8999999999999s)]
*  Have you ever? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1941.82s)]
*  Okay, and word let's play. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1943.46s)]
*  Have you ever watched your enemy down? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1946.06s)]
*  Walked your enemy down. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1948.14s)]
*  These lyrics wrong as fuck. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1949.82s)]
*  Yeah I know. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1951.06s)]
*  Genius. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1952.5s)]
*  So Rap Deen is just trying to get, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1953.32s)]
*  and I think it's just a white guy doing his best. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1954.3s)]
*  He doesn't know what walked your enemy down means. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1957.1000000000001s)]
*  Literally I was refreshing the page [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1958.94s)]
*  and you would just see more words like. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1960.66s)]
*  Changing? [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1962.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1963.3s)]
*  I think when it's highlighted gray [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1964.14s)]
*  that means either they're not sure [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1965.46s)]
*  or maybe this is all they are sure about or whatever. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1966.82s)]
*  No, when it's highlighted gray that means [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1968.7s)]
*  there's a hyperlink so you can click it and it explains. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1970.06s)]
*  Oh, what fucking. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1972.5s)]
*  Yeah okay. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1974.06s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1975.06s)]
*  It's all right. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1975.9s)]
*  I don't need Rap Deen as I'm not white. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1976.98s)]
*  An open case is an ongoing investigation. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1978.78s)]
*  That's what I figured. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1982.26s)]
*  500,000 to an open case. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1983.22s)]
*  So I guess he's trying to like pay off a case he's saying. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1985.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1987.5s)]
*  Or it's opening a case of money with 500 grand in it. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1988.34s)]
*  You know what I'm saying. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1990.86s)]

*  Nah, I think he's saying he paid off, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1994.94s)]
*  he paid 500k to maybe get rid of a case. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1996.9s)]
*  He said I'll park your son. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=1999.74s)]
*  Park is that just, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2001.7s)]
*  because somebody asked does Drake's mom have Park, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2003.42s)]
*  Parkinson's, is that you that asked that? [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2006.1000000000001s)]

*  Nah, I think so. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2019.0600000000002s)]
*  Similar. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2020.02s)]
*  That's if you have multiple sclerosis [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2020.8600000000001s)]

*  What's Parkinson's? [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2028.9s)]
*  I thought that's what Michael J Fox got. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2029.74s)]
*  The Harlem. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2032.58s)]

*  Correct. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2035.1s)]
*  It's true. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2035.9399999999998s)]
*  Medically speaking, yes. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2036.78s)]
*  Okay. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2038.6599999999999s)]

*  Apparently Drake had to cease and desist [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2058.38s)]
*  for his diss, for Kendrick's diss. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2060.02s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2062.2599999999998s)]

*  and desist the Like That record, you ain't like that record? [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2066.02s)]
*  When he starts talking in a Toronto accent. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2068.1s)]

*  That's very nice. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2073.58s)]
*  It is so much fun to be prisoner of the moment, guys. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2074.42s)]
*  I'm telling you, if you just let yourself go [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2077.3s)]
*  and you just indulge in the last thing that you try, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2080.86s)]
*  your life will be so much more enjoyable. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2084.7s)]
*  Yeah, because you're not constantly comparing. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2086.82s)]
*  You're just going, oh, this is awesome. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2088.3s)]
*  I'm a Drake hater. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2090.7s)]
*  Up until four hours ago, I was like, Drake won. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2091.54s)]
*  There's nothing Kendrick can do. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2093.5s)]
*  There's nothing he can do. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2094.8199999999997s)]
*  It's taken too long. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2095.7799999999997s)]
*  And now I'm like, this a wrap? [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2096.8599999999997s)]
*  This a wrap? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2098.4599999999996s)]
*  What do you even say, Drake, it's over? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2099.2999999999997s)]
*  It's over. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2101.7799999999997s)]
*  I definitely was saying that this week, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2102.8999999999996s)]
*  and I was like, if nothing drops this week, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2104.22s)]
*  then it's over, it's done. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2106.18s)]
*  Kendrick, you're through. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2107.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's not. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2109.62s)]
*  And how long was it, two weeks? [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2110.4599999999996s)]
*  Two weeks for him to drop? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2111.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, pretty much, two weeks. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2112.7s)]
*  18 days, I think, according to... [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2113.9399999999996s)]
*  That was what Drake took. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2116.02s)]
*  Drake might have taken 28. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2117.66s)]
*  But Drake dropped on, I think it was Saturday morning. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2119.2599999999998s)]
*  So this is Tuesday. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2121.62s)]
*  So he's two weeks and some days. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2123.06s)]
*  All right. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2125.42s)]
*  But it's around the same time. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2126.2599999999998s)]
*  It's not like some crazy shit. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2127.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2128.9s)]
*  I think it's... [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2129.74s)]
*  It's good that he made it really long, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2130.58s)]
*  because now it's like, all right, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2132.18s)]
*  we're giving you a little bit more grace, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2134.34s)]
*  because we see you put the work in. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2135.82s)]
*  But if you just came back with like one verse... [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2138.94s)]
*  Dude, diss tracks need to have radio play. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2141.42s)]
*  Like, I feel like a diss track with radio play [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2143.74s)]
*  is a better diss. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2145.2599999999998s)]
*  It is more effective. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2146.66s)]
*  It's more effective. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2148.02s)]
*  And then, like, back to back, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2149.7000000000003s)]
*  you'll be in the club being like, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2150.94s)]
*  yo, is that a world tour or your girl's tour? [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2152.78s)]
*  Like, forever. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2154.38s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2155.2200000000003s)]
*  It's such a fantastic line. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2156.06s)]
*  People are gonna be dissing this guy in the perpetuity, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2156.9s)]
*  whereas some of these other ones, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2160.02s)]
*  like the story of Addie Dawn is a good diss, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2161.58s)]
*  but it's like... [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2164.6600000000003s)]
*  You'll never hear it again. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2165.5s)]
*  I can't remember the last song. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2166.34s)]
*  I heard it since it played. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2167.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, but he still, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2168.02s)]
*  Pusha does get the win for that one. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2169.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2171.3s)]
*  I don't even think... [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2172.1400000000003s)]
*  This is where there's some debate. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2172.98s)]
*  What I will say is this. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2174.98s)]
*  That a diss track could get escape velocity, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2176.62s)]
*  which is Ether, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2178.7799999999997s)]
*  which is, what is the pop one about Biggie? [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2181.18s)]
*  Hit em' up. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2183.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, hit em' up. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2184.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, that's also like a radio song. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2185.1s)]
*  First off, fuck you bitch and click you. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2187.58s)]
*  Yeah, it's pure radio. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2189.1s)]
*  I mean, it's crazy. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2190.5s)]
*  But Ether wasn't... [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2191.3399999999997s)]
*  Get money. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2192.18s)]
*  Yeah, Ether wasn't radio. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2193.02s)]
*  No. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2194.5s)]
*  But everybody knows it. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2195.3399999999997s)]
*  It became a word. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2196.98s)]
*  Like, it's part of vernacular. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2198.5s)]
*  So, if it's that nice, it could do it. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2200.06s)]
*  This is not that nice. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2202.3399999999997s)]
*  And neither is Drake's, to be honest with you. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2204.42s)]
*  Neither of them approach Ether levels, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2206.14s)]
*  where you're just like, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2207.8199999999997s)]
*  that's the only thing you think about [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2208.66s)]
*  when it comes to rap beef. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2209.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2210.86s)]
*  But in terms of radio play, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2211.7s)]
*  I think Pusha is more radio friendly than this one. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2212.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2215.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, but I think that's a general goal of Drake's. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2216.62s)]
*  Like that is way more. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2218.8199999999997s)]
*  It's the best. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2220.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2221.1s)]
*  Like, last is number one. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2221.94s)]
*  Yeah, I should fire Assel. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2222.7799999999997s)]
*  Good point. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2224.3399999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2225.74s)]
*  Okay, so any other things from this diss? [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2226.58s)]
*  Do we see anything happen? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2228.54s)]
*  You heard it's starting to get a little violent, potentially. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2230.2599999999998s)]
*  Because one of the dudes' houses got robbed. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2232.58s)]
*  Yeah, could be a coincidence. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2235.5s)]
*  I think this was, who's? [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2236.46s)]
*  Cash, one of the managers from XO. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2239.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2242.94s)]
*  That's Drake's shit. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2244.2200000000003s)]
*  No, Weekend. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2245.06s)]
*  I think that's Weekend's manager. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2245.9s)]
*  Oh. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2247.02s)]
*  And there was like gunshots and shit, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2248.3s)]
*  and somebody might've gotten injured. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2250.1s)]
*  So like now, unfortunately, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2251.34s)]
*  the rap beef that we all thought [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2253.38s)]
*  was gonna be the safest, most verbal, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2254.9s)]
*  has become physical and violent. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2258.2200000000003s)]
*  And that's corn, that's some pussy shit, bro. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2260.7400000000002s)]
*  That is the most pussy-ass shit. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2264.7s)]
*  It's like, you have the ability to go back. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2266.3399999999997s)]
*  You said the shit, right? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2269.02s)]
*  You have the ability to take shots, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2270.5s)]
*  go take the shots, take it back. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2272.06s)]
*  You guys have studios, you have music, you are creatives. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2273.74s)]
*  You have the ability to compete on a creative level. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2276.42s)]
*  And if, if, hypothetically, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2279.2999999999997s)]
*  if somebody is telling someone to go rob them, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2281.98s)]
*  or is paying somebody to go shake shit up, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2285.66s)]
*  that's soft, bro. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2287.8199999999997s)]
*  That's an admission of weakness, in my opinion. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2289.62s)]
*  Yeah, that's why, and Drake's so calculated, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2293.7s)]
*  why I don't think he would do that, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2295.62s)]
*  especially this close to the beach. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2297.74s)]
*  That can't be from his crew. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2298.58s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's, you know how people [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2300.5s)]
*  just wanna be like, oh, hey, I wanna get down [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2302.14s)]
*  with this crew, so let me just do something. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2304.14s)]
*  Oh, so they're doing it, too. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2304.98s)]
*  Look what I did. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2305.8199999999997s)]
*  I think that's what that is. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2306.66s)]
*  I brought you the truth. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2307.5s)]
*  And especially LA, everybody knows where everyone lives. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2308.3399999999997s)]
*  What happened in LA? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2311.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2312.14s)]
*  That could've just been a regular. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2312.98s)]
*  That is another thing. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2313.8199999999997s)]
*  Nah, you're right, my bad. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2314.94s)]
*  Didn't calculate that. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2316.3399999999997s)]
*  He got LA. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2317.5s)]
*  Yeah, I got nothing to do. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2318.58s)]
*  Actually, this is the perfect time to rob all of them, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2320.3399999999997s)]
*  because they're gonna be looking for suspects in the ops. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2322.58s)]
*  Not just random robbers. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2326.62s)]
*  This is the best time in history [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2328.46s)]
*  to be a white robber in LA. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2329.54s)]
*  If you're a white guy that robs famous people in LA, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2332.06s)]
*  get to work, because nobody's coming to look, right? [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2334.54s)]
*  Yeah, rob any rapper, you're good. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2337.46s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2339.42s)]
*  If you're one of these guys, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2340.2599999999998s)]
*  you gotta protect the other guy's house. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2341.1s)]
*  This is like the mob shit, where a guy gets out of prison [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2344.1s)]
*  and he has to protect the snitch. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2346.3s)]
*  Wait, break this down. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2348.82s)]
*  I forget what I was talking about. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2350.02s)]
*  I was talking to some guy that went to prison [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2351.02s)]
*  and he was basically going back and forth with this guy, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2353.7400000000002s)]
*  and if the guy died, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2356.5s)]
*  then he would be the number one suspect. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2358.1s)]
*  So now he had to pay bodyguards [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2360.46s)]
*  to protect the guy that was suing him. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2362.86s)]
*  So that he wouldn't have to snitch? [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2365.02s)]
*  So that the guy that he was against, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2366.6600000000003s)]
*  if anything happened to him, if he got in a car accident, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2369.54s)]
*  if he slipped and tripped down the stairs, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2371.46s)]
*  he would be the suspect, because he had a violent history. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2373.94s)]
*  So these two guys were in some type of litigation, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2376.26s)]
*  and the one guy had to protect the other guy. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2378.38s)]
*  Because if anything happened, he would be the suspect. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2381.78s)]
*  Right, right, right, right, right. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2384.7000000000003s)]
*  So this is the same thing, bro. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2385.54s)]
*  Drake has to protect all of Kendrick's people. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2386.38s)]
*  Send the security. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2388.42s)]
*  Make sure he's ready to cook. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2389.98s)]
*  Just not the security that was with Whitney, though. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2392.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2394.78s)]
*  Yo, this guy. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2395.9s)]
*  This guy is wild. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2399.1400000000003s)]
*  He's Team OVO. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2401.46s)]
*  Nah, that was in the rap song. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2402.94s)]
*  What tipped you off? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2404.7400000000002s)]
*  Being dressed like a sperm. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2406.98s)]
*  Oh, the three Drake concerts I went to? [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2410.94s)]
*  Am I crazy? [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2413.1800000000003s)]
*  You like the three Drake concerts and two Nick games? [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2414.02s)]
*  I knew you were a fucking loser, dude. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2416.06s)]
*  I knew you were a fucking loser. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2418.02s)]
*  Take the hat off. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2419.34s)]
*  Take one down, dude. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2420.1800000000003s)]
*  You got the nail polish. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2421.1800000000003s)]
*  That's your uniform. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2422.34s)]
*  So he switched it up. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2423.1800000000003s)]
*  He had Wayne one night, he had J. Cole another night. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2424.1000000000004s)]
*  That's different concerts right there. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2426.34s)]
*  Am I crazy? [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2428.6600000000003s)]
*  We're feeling like this is kind of WWE. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2429.5s)]
*  Like maybe I've been talking to my mom too much, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2431.78s)]
*  but there's a part of me deep in my core where I'm like. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2433.2200000000003s)]
*  Both of them are in on this. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2435.78s)]
*  Everyone, right? [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2436.7000000000003s)]
*  Why are you trying to take the fun out of it? [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2437.54s)]
*  Maybe it can get away. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2439.2200000000003s)]
*  To be fair, he does say like, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2441.1800000000003s)]
*  what's all this real shit? [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2442.86s)]
*  This is sport. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2445.7400000000002s)]
*  This is what it is. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2446.58s)]
*  We're just talking shit. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2447.46s)]
*  This isn't a real thing. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2448.42s)]
*  He like says that. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2449.6600000000003s)]
*  But then he says some wild shit about not raising his son. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2451.3s)]
*  Oh yeah, that was wild. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2454.54s)]
*  He's like, hey sport. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2455.86s)]
*  I don't like that. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2458.02s)]
*  And he'll say like, oh, I didn't shoot the AK right [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2458.86s)]
*  the first time I shot it. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2462.2200000000003s)]
*  Now I know how to shoot it now. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2463.06s)]
*  I gotta aim lower. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2464.6200000000003s)]
*  Why does he say that? [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2465.58s)]
*  Because of the recoil. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2466.6200000000003s)]
*  That was the blackest moment Al's ever had. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2468.86s)]
*  But he must not have been in an AK [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2471.78s)]
*  because the AK doesn't have recoil. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2474.78s)]
*  Well, they say in the Draco, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2477.42s)]
*  I think the Draco is the, what's the gun they all use? [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2478.7400000000002s)]
*  Who's they? [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=2483.82s)]

*  and it doesn't break their heart that the world can be, [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3159.6800000000003s)]
*  treat them a little bit differently. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3162.64s)]

*  They would have a bunch of counterfeit shit all on the blankets. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3272.96s)]
*  But then police would come and they couldn't pick the shit up [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3275.64s)]
*  and so they would lose all their stuff. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3278.84s)]
*  So now they keep everything in bags or they keep it like away in some place [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3280.2000000000003s)]
*  and they'll have to take you around the corner to sell you some shit. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3284.28s)]
*  And so when the police come, they all just run with their bags. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3287.08s)]
*  And it was a frenzy when I walked out the studio. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3291.1200000000003s)]

*  In sandals. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3298.1600000000003s)]
*  So the guy who was the most selfish, who had the most amount of bags, [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3298.92s)]
*  he got caught because he couldn't. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3302.1600000000003s)]

*  They are breaking the law, cursing at the cops. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3306.8s)]
*  Only white people have ever seen do that. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3309.08s)]
*  White people, the only people I've ever seen do something illegal, [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3311.6s)]

*  No, no, no. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3903.12s)]
*  You need the individual spirit, bro. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3903.7599999999998s)]
*  They're about to have Lindsay sanity. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3905.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3906.56s)]

*  This is crazy. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3923.8s)]

*  because they're already over there. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3928.28s)]

*  Fair enough. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3932.04s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3932.84s)]
*  I don't know what that... [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3933.8s)]
*  What is it? [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3934.52s)]
*  They're doing hops? [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3935.36s)]
*  Oh, Chinese are blacker than black people. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3936.36s)]
*  This is... [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3939.12s)]
*  Nah, that's disrespectful right now. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3939.84s)]
*  They play dancing. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3941.96s)]
*  Now they got double duds. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3943.12s)]
*  They're doing double duds and they're playing basketball. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3944.1600000000003s)]
*  Nah, that's crazy right there, bro. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3946.72s)]
*  This makes you think they're taking over. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3949.48s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3952.04s)]
*  I ain't worried. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3953.68s)]
*  I mean, that's crazy. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3954.3199999999997s)]
*  They're not going to take over. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3955.56s)]
*  Let me just join them. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3956.68s)]
*  Not enough individual spirit, bro. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3959.48s)]
*  You really need that. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3962.04s)]
*  You really need that. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3963.8799999999997s)]
*  You keep telling yourself that. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3964.64s)]
*  I'm telling you, bro. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3966.0s)]
*  They don't know how to do it. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3966.72s)]
*  They don't know how to create shit. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3967.48s)]
*  They know how to steal our IP and then reverse engineer it [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3968.48s)]
*  and then put it out. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3971.2799999999997s)]
*  But they don't know how to actually create things. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3972.12s)]
*  I think they can't create things because they [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3973.9599999999996s)]
*  crush the individual spirit. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3975.36s)]
*  All the billionaires out there get squashed. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3976.88s)]
*  Your boy Jack Ma is actually creating interesting shit. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3978.56s)]
*  And then they pull him into a fucking room and say, [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3980.96s)]
*  you're not going out for two weeks unless you behave. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3983.1600000000003s)]
*  And if you keep doing that, then you kill the soul, bro. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3985.32s)]
*  You kill the soul. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3988.84s)]
*  So I'm not tripping about that. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3989.76s)]
*  Our things are fucked up here, too. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3991.56s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3993.1200000000003s)]
*  We can kill our souls as well. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3994.48s)]
*  But a society that functions the way ours does, [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=3995.96s)]
*  where we will really promote business and promote greatness, [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4000.0s)]
*  will always thrive, I think, over an authoritarian society. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4003.56s)]
*  That's my opinion. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4006.44s)]
*  Because they just can't create the shit that's necessary. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4008.12s)]
*  If they keep stealing our shit, [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4009.92s)]
*  Which I do. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4011.28s)]
*  They steal it and make it better. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4012.12s)]
*  When you make it better, you can profit a lot. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4013.12s)]
*  That's what I keep thinking. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4014.56s)]
*  You can make a lot of profit and dominate. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4015.64s)]
*  Dominance isn't in necessarily invention. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4017.72s)]
*  It's in perfection. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4019.96s)]
*  That's an interesting thing. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4022.08s)]
*  But I mean, the market wouldn't say just yet. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4022.92s)]
*  Obviously they've had incredible growth, [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4025.92s)]
*  but that happens faster when you're coming [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4027.8s)]
*  from nothing to something. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4029.8s)]
*  So now we have to see if they plateau. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4031.88s)]
*  It's looking like they're coming down a little bit. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4033.44s)]
*  I hope so. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4035.52s)]
*  Who knows? [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4036.36s)]
*  I want them to eat. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4037.2000000000003s)]
*  I want them to be good. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4038.04s)]
*  I want them to eat, but I don't want them to be... [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4038.88s)]
*  I think you said this years ago and it stuck with me. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4039.96s)]
*  We're gonna miss the American superpower [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4042.7200000000003s)]
*  if China takes over. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4044.52s)]
*  We're gonna be like, [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4045.52s)]
*  oh, the American empire wasn't all good, [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4046.36s)]
*  but it was a better alternative. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4048.32s)]

*  India's coming. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4057.0s)]
*  That's the only real hope you got [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4057.92s)]
*  if you're anti-China, in India. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4059.32s)]
*  Yeah, we gotta back you guys, bro, for real. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4062.12s)]
*  Yeah, 1000%. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4063.52s)]
*  You guys have nukes? [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4064.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4065.52s)]
*  Oh, sick. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4066.36s)]
*  Got it. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4067.2000000000003s)]
*  You got some Pakistan right next door. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4068.04s)]
*  We both nuked up. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4068.88s)]
*  Wait, Pakistan has nukes? [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4069.92s)]
*  Yeah, dog, come on now. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4070.76s)]
*  How much do you think that they work? [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4072.48s)]
*  Like both of y'alls. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4075.56s)]
*  It don't really work. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4077.1600000000003s)]
*  Like, you got it. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4078.12s)]
*  I don't know if you could get it off the ground. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4079.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't know if it's really gonna explode. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4081.36s)]
*  Are you trying to tell me that you don't think [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4083.08s)]
*  a bunch of Asians could engineer nukes? [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4085.8s)]
*  Nah. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4088.32s)]
*  Now you're Asian. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4089.1600000000003s)]
*  Nah. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4089.98s)]
*  Now you're Asian. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4091.06s)]
*  Nah, you're riding with them, bro. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4091.9s)]
*  Now you're Asian. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4093.54s)]
*  I'm fine with a bunch of brown, [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4094.38s)]
*  bassies, can't engineer nukes. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4095.86s)]
*  This is what I'm saying, like, [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4097.860000000001s)]
*  Trevor Noah Wynn did a show out there, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4098.78s)]
*  they couldn't even get the microphone to work, [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4100.22s)]
*  so I'm like, I'll just... [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4101.860000000001s)]
*  Maybe that's his black ass? [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4102.7s)]
*  I'm fuckin' lucky we came. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4103.74s)]
*  We came to see the white app, Trevor. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4107.1s)]
*  Trevor. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4109.62s)]
*  All right, so maybe, yeah, you came to see the Trevor. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4110.46s)]
*  Yeah, so maybe, I don't know, I don't know. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4112.46s)]
*  Because I do think about that sometimes. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4114.74s)]
*  Like, I don't know if people's tech really works like that. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4116.74s)]
*  Can't believe he went to India, [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4119.3s)]
*  was surprised the show wasn't run the way. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4120.780000000001s)]
*  He's like, I'm a fuckin' idiot. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4122.58s)]
*  We do have high expectations for Indians [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4124.46s)]
*  based on who we see here. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4126.62s)]
*  Yeah, the best ones are here. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4128.14s)]
*  But that's the thing, so... [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4129.38s)]
*  Go to England, you'll lower your expectations. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4130.22s)]
*  But... [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4132.26s)]
*  Wait, England's like the G League? [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4134.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's G League, it's G League. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4136.26s)]
*  Really? [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4137.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4138.66s)]
*  It was explained to me, because I thought all Indians [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4139.5s)]
*  were super smart, engineered, doctor, and there's a lot. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4141.22s)]
*  But it's the hardest to get into America. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4143.860000000001s)]
*  So they take, like, one of my uncles, [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4145.9400000000005s)]
*  a family friend uncle's, [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4148.1s)]
*  Rice University was like, we will pay you, [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4149.42s)]
*  we'll get you citizenship, we'll get you a job. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4151.1s)]
*  No, we'll go to Rice. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4152.42s)]
*  Come on. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4153.26s)]
*  Yeah, you heard that. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4154.1s)]
*  Fuckin' we would. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4154.9400000000005s)]
*  Rice University. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4155.780000000001s)]
*  In fact, that's a great joke. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4156.620000000001s)]
*  But they like, we want the best over here. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4159.46s)]
*  And then England was not as tough on immigration, [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4162.18s)]
*  they let more people in, so it was just like, [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4164.580000000001s)]
*  if I wanna get out of India, it's way easier to go to England. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4165.9400000000005s)]
*  The best went to America. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4167.9400000000005s)]
*  Got it, got it. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4169.740000000001s)]
*  Then probably Canada, then probably India. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4170.580000000001s)]
*  So then we have this expectation of Indians, [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4171.900000000001s)]
*  which is like super successful, super wealthy, [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4174.18s)]
*  like brilliant, like the Indian kids in your class [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4176.42s)]
*  are always at the top of your class. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4179.02s)]
*  And then- [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4180.38s)]
*  Cause they're from the smartest stock. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4181.22s)]
*  Right, and then Americans go to India, [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4182.1s)]
*  and then they see the other billions. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4183.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4186.34s)]
*  And I'm sure they see the smartest there as well. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4187.18s)]
*  Yeah, 1000%, but it's a country just like any other. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4189.3s)]
*  But there's a spectrum, right, yeah. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4192.02s)]
*  But that is kind of funny, it's like, [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4193.26s)]
*  our expectation of Indians is so high [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4195.82s)]
*  that we must get let down when we go there. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4198.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's a billion people. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4200.38s)]
*  Right, it's like if you only knew the royal family, [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4202.62s)]
*  and then you went to some like black pool [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4205.62s)]
*  or something like that in England, [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4207.66s)]
*  you'd be like, what the fuck is going on over there? [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4208.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4211.38s)]
*  They do have the nuke on a tuk-tuk. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4212.86s)]
*  Which is kind of funny. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4214.42s)]
*  Yo, if anybody makes tuk-tuks, [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4216.66s)]
*  I wanna buy one in America, [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4217.78s)]
*  I wanna whip one around New York. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4218.9s)]
*  Yo, let's get Akash and Tuk-Tuk. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4220.14s)]
*  That don't work at all, ain't no way that works. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4222.18s)]
*  I'm not trippin', if I'm Pakistan, I'm not trippin'. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4225.1s)]
*  I think y'all got an agreement, [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4227.14s)]
*  which is like, yo, both of this shit don't work, we good? [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4228.3s)]
*  I hope so. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4230.82s)]
*  I hope so. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4231.9s)]
*  I trust them, cause they go into the moon and shit. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4232.74s)]
*  Now, come on. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4234.74s)]
*  They would send them to the moon. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4237.02s)]
*  We would go to the moon. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4239.14s)]
*  They ain't gonna move. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4239.9800000000005s)]
*  We would go to the moon. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4241.26s)]
*  Anything to get us away from Pakistan. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4242.86s)]
*  You'd send them there. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4244.82s)]
*  Put them on a ship. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4246.62s)]
*  All right, guys, we're gonna take a quick break [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4248.62s)]
*  because I need to talk to some of you. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4250.46s)]

*  but some of you might have been injured [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4253.7s)]
*  by the neglect of another person. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4255.42s)]
*  And that sucks. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4257.42s)]
*  You gotta deal with health insurance companies, [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4258.42s)]
*  you probably got medical bills, [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4259.9800000000005s)]

*  AI drones. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4396.5s)]
*  This is terrifying. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4398.5s)]
*  Like Palantir? [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4399.32s)]
*  This is Palantir's technology? [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4400.78s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4403.3s)]
*  There's a couple of these startups [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4404.14s)]
*  that have gone into military tech. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4405.74s)]
*  Bro, this is terrifying. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4407.5s)]
*  Okay, go. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4408.9s)]
*  And the AI's deciding the targets. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4409.74s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, I'm sorry. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4410.58s)]
*  Okay, okay, now I understand. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4412.660000000001s)]
*  I didn't realize how they already have the tech for it. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4413.740000000001s)]
*  So this is happening in Russia, Ukraine. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4417.54s)]
*  So Ukraine has basically these drones [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4419.46s)]
*  that people are controlling, right? [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4422.04s)]
*  There's a dude in a bunker with an Xbox controller [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4423.1s)]
*  and he's controlling where the drone goes and who it hits. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4424.820000000001s)]
*  But they have jamming technology [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4427.280000000001s)]
*  where they can disrupt the signal [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4428.9800000000005s)]
*  from the ground to the thing. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4430.700000000001s)]
*  Got it. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4432.34s)]
*  So how do you go around this problem? [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4433.160000000001s)]
*  You put the brain inside the aircraft. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4435.0s)]
*  So now they're able to send the aircraft off [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4438.160000000001s)]
*  and it's all internal and it's all autonomous. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4439.88s)]
*  So now they can be like, all right, hit this target, [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4442.72s)]
*  do this thing, da da da. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4444.52s)]
*  And the drone is able to fly around [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4445.76s)]
*  and be like target acquired, boom, hit it. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4447.28s)]
*  How does it know it's a target? [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4449.16s)]
*  Because it's all programmed through the AI. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4450.32s)]
*  But how can it distinguish [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4452.9800000000005s)]
*  between an innocent civilian and a target? [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4454.0s)]
*  Because they're able to basically say like, [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4455.92s)]
*  we're going to this militarized zone. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4457.6s)]
*  All the people on the front line are insurgents. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4459.56s)]
*  They're all Russians. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4461.68s)]
*  And so if we're able to detect someone in this space, [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4462.6s)]
*  we're gonna drone them. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4464.72s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4465.68s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4466.52s)]
*  And when they first started doing it, [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4467.400000000001s)]
*  they were just using DJI drones. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4468.4s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4470.44s)]
*  Like the same ones that we would use. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4471.28s)]
*  Oh, the same ones that we would use? [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4472.099999999999s)]
*  Consumer drones. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4472.94s)]
*  They were buying those and then retrofitting them [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4473.96s)]
*  to drop grenades and shit. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4475.96s)]
*  And then they would, it has the camera still on it. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4477.16s)]
*  It's the crazy part. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4479.36s)]
*  And then they'd upload it to Reddit. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4480.2s)]
*  So there'd just be a Russian guy smoking a cigarette [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4481.24s)]
*  and then drones over top of them. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4483.759999999999s)]
*  And then they'd drop it and then they'd upload this. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4485.2s)]
*  Son, this is how- Crazy. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4487.0s)]
*  That Turkish village underground happens. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4488.719999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4491.16s)]
*  What's that village called? [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4492.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4493.5199999999995s)]
*  There's the place that like 60,000 people [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4494.48s)]
*  could live underground. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4498.06s)]
*  Remember Billy was talking about it. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4499.22s)]
*  What the fuck is it called? [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4500.580000000001s)]
*  Vilanku. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4501.54s)]
*  Derunkuyu. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4502.46s)]
*  Derunkuyu. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4503.3s)]
*  Something like that. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4504.14s)]
*  Derunkuyu. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4504.9800000000005s)]
*  Derunkuyu, yeah. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4505.820000000001s)]
*  But this is how it happens, right? [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4506.9800000000005s)]
*  Like it's not necessarily, I mean, [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4508.14s)]
*  if we're gonna believe this, [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4510.14s)]
*  we had advanced technology back in the day [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4511.580000000001s)]
*  and then it got wiped away. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4513.76s)]
*  It would happen like this. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4515.34s)]
*  Drone warfare where you're constantly bombarded. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4516.740000000001s)]
*  So you have to go underground to avoid that [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4520.34s)]
*  where the drones can't go. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4523.400000000001s)]
*  Or you have to completely dome up your cities, [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4524.700000000001s)]
*  which seems like an impossible thing to do. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4527.14s)]
*  You mean Israel? [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4529.38s)]
*  Do you see- [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4530.820000000001s)]
*  I'm having a match. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4531.64s)]
*  But this, it looks like it would pass through it. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4532.4800000000005s)]
*  Right, because this is a tiny little, [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4535.62s)]
*  it's not a missile, this is just like a drone. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4538.34s)]
*  Like I imagine people in Israel have drones. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4540.740000000001s)]
*  Just like recreational. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4542.740000000001s)]
*  Oh, I get what you mean. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4544.06s)]
*  And then you just retrofit them. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4544.900000000001s)]
*  So then they have all this footage [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4545.820000000001s)]
*  where it's just like a guy alone in a foxhole, [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4547.02s)]
*  his leg's broken and they can't get him out. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4549.780000000001s)]
*  And it's just like- I saw that shit. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4551.62s)]
*  I saw that shit. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4552.62s)]
*  It's just the dude and then they drop it, it's crazy. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4553.46s)]
*  Have you seen the Air Force just did AI dog fighting? [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4555.14s)]
*  No. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4559.46s)]
*  With our jets. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4560.3s)]
*  DARPA is like the top of the military. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4561.3s)]
*  Like the most intelligent people are in DARPA [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4563.5s)]
*  and they're like making the craziest things. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4566.38s)]
*  And they put an AI brain, whatever. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4567.740000000001s)]
*  They put AI into a experimental jet [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4572.12s)]
*  and then let it fly itself. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4574.5s)]
*  And it got in a dog fight with like fake weapons, [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4577.56s)]
*  but with another pilot who was a real pilot [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4580.34s)]
*  and the AI won the dog fight. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4582.9800000000005s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4584.86s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4586.38s)]
*  And now they're able to do this with nuclear subs. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4587.219999999999s)]
*  So back in the day, nuclear subs could go down [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4589.94s)]
*  for months at a time, six, seven months, [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4591.7s)]
*  and never be detected. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4593.179999999999s)]
*  They could just sit in the wings. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4594.0199999999995s)]
*  But you had staff on it. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4595.299999999999s)]
*  You had soldiers and sailors that had to get like fed [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4596.42s)]
*  and they were able to oxygenate the thing [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4598.78s)]
*  because they were able to take the hydrogen out. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4601.54s)]
*  So they were able to keep oxygen, [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4603.5s)]
*  but they had to get food and supplies and shit. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4604.54s)]
*  But now that AI can do it, [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4606.339999999999s)]
*  these submarines can stay underwater forever. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4607.7s)]
*  Wow. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4610.179999999999s)]
*  And they can just sit there just chilling. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4611.0199999999995s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4612.54s)]
*  And then apparently they signed an agreement [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4613.38s)]
*  where they weren't gonna use AI for nuclear war, [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4614.82s)]
*  but maybe. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4617.82s)]
*  And we got AI. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4620.38s)]
*  Yeah. Good. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4622.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4626.259999999999s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4627.259999999999s)]
*  No, that is, yeah, that Ukraine Russia shit is like, [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4628.34s)]
*  Ukrainians need to convert to Islam fast [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4631.94s)]
*  if they want people to care about that war. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4634.94s)]
*  If they actually want to keep their country, [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4638.099999999999s)]
*  they need to convert immediately [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4640.34s)]
*  and convince everybody that they're brown. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4642.74s)]
*  Mm. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4645.139999999999s)]
*  Because when it's white on white, nobody gives a fuck. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4646.26s)]
*  We cared. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4648.86s)]
*  We cared for a little because we needed something [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4649.94s)]
*  to care about and we don't like Russians. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4652.3s)]
*  But then the hotter new shit started. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4654.42s)]
*  Yo, once they had new shit, [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4656.0199999999995s)]
*  and the new shit, it looks like, [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4657.179999999999s)]
*  because everybody in America, the people, [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4658.7s)]
*  not everybody, but a lot of people. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4660.58s)]
*  But the new shit is the old shit. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4661.42s)]
*  It's the classic. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4662.46s)]
*  The classic feedback. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4663.3s)]
*  We like classic. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4664.139999999999s)]
*  But also the way that people are seeing it, [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4664.98s)]
*  because a lot of people that are part of these protests [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4667.46s)]
*  right now, there are a lot of people [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4669.54s)]
*  that do know what's going on [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4670.38s)]
*  and they've cared about this for generations, sure. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4671.34s)]
*  But there's a lot of people [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4673.7s)]
*  that are popping on the newest trends [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4674.54s)]
*  and they think that Jews are white [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4676.02s)]
*  because they watch Seinfeld [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4678.22s)]
*  and Palestinians are brown, right? [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4679.46s)]
*  So they're looking at it as white oppressor [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4681.38s)]
*  and then brown oppress. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4684.5s)]
*  And that is way more delicious [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4686.06s)]
*  for the people that want to support oppression everywhere. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4687.74s)]
*  When they see blonde hair, blue eyes, [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4690.06s)]
*  fighting blonde hair, blue eyes, [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4691.62s)]
*  they're like, fuck these colonizers. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4692.74s)]
*  I don't want nothing to do with them. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4694.900000000001s)]
*  They can go figure that shit out themselves. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4696.5s)]
*  So Ukraine, y'all need to take your most tan motherfuckers [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4698.06s)]
*  and you need to put them on the front line [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4701.660000000001s)]
*  and then you need to convert to Islam immediately. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4703.3s)]
*  Yeah, that would actually work. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4705.3s)]
*  Tell me that wouldn't work. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4707.18s)]
*  Here's, I was actually looking it up. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4708.860000000001s)]
*  I was like, is there a new conflict I can care about? [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4710.5s)]
*  Where's the next one? [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4712.860000000001s)]
*  Trump, Bronson. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4713.860000000001s)]
*  So these are all the ones that are happening in the world. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4714.700000000001s)]
*  So over here, obviously you got war in Ukraine. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4716.620000000001s)]
*  You got Israel, Palestine. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4718.9800000000005s)]
*  Then you got all these random ones. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4720.54s)]
*  You're like, oh, we don't even know anything about these. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4721.54s)]
*  No, nobody's caring. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4723.26s)]
*  What's that one right there? [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4724.700000000001s)]
*  Is that Congo? [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4725.54s)]
*  Congo's always liddy. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4726.38s)]
*  So we could jump on that bandwagon. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4728.18s)]
*  But what's Congo? [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4729.7s)]
*  Congo is just black on black? [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4730.54s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4732.38s)]
*  Yeah, we can't. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4733.22s)]
*  We can't. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4734.0599999999995s)]
*  It's too hard to tell. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4735.0599999999995s)]
*  We need a little bit of like, you know, [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4736.66s)]
*  we need some friction. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4738.74s)]
*  We need to see the friction. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4739.58s)]
*  Like Hutus and Tutsis, I don't even remember. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4740.42s)]
*  I think the Hutus were the bad guys. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4742.42s)]
*  I don't even remember. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4744.0199999999995s)]
*  I think Don Chino won it. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4744.86s)]
*  I don't even remember. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4745.78s)]
*  Yeah, I think he did. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4746.62s)]
*  Okay, let's see. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4747.46s)]
*  India, Pakistan, we're not caring. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4748.3s)]
*  The tale is old as time. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4749.7s)]
*  China, Taiwan. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4751.34s)]
*  The tale is old as time. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4752.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4754.5s)]
*  1947. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4755.34s)]
*  Beauty and the Beast. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4756.18s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4757.06s)]
*  You got North Korea. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4758.860000000001s)]
*  I'm sorry, guys. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4760.46s)]
*  You need to step it up. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4762.02s)]
*  Oh, Myanmar. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4763.620000000001s)]
*  We can jump on this one. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4764.46s)]
*  Civil War Myanmar. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4765.38s)]
*  Is that how big Myanmar is? [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4766.22s)]
*  Ah, it's bigger than I thought, dog. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4767.620000000001s)]
*  Son, I used to go to this Myanmar restaurant [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4769.22s)]
*  and they had a tree that you could clip dollar bills [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4771.26s)]
*  to like send money back there. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4773.580000000001s)]
*  I used to like donate. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4775.740000000001s)]
*  I would have never donated [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4776.820000000001s)]
*  if I knew how big the fucking country was. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4778.06s)]
*  I thought it was a little speck. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4779.9800000000005s)]
*  I thought it was a dot on the map. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4781.18s)]
*  It's a gigantic land mass. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4782.38s)]
*  They got beachfront. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4783.580000000001s)]
*  Look at all that. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4784.42s)]
*  Look at all the coastline. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4785.26s)]
*  What are you fighting about? [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4786.1s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4787.5s)]
*  And what do they look? [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4788.34s)]
*  Do they look more Indian or more Asian? [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4789.18s)]
*  They're Thai, basically. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4791.860000000001s)]
*  I think they're the Asian. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4793.06s)]
*  Yeah, they're like a dark Asian. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4793.900000000001s)]
*  Dark Asian. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4794.900000000001s)]
*  They're Burmese. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4795.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4797.26s)]
*  In the words of Ali Wong, jungle Asian. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4798.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4799.620000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4800.46s)]
*  With the dark lips. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4801.3s)]
*  They got the dark lips. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4802.14s)]
*  Biting though. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4802.9800000000005s)]
*  Oh, they probably got a few baddies. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4803.820000000001s)]
*  Biting the whole neck ring thing. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4804.700000000001s)]
*  Oh, no way. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4806.18s)]
*  I never seen an Asian with that. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4807.38s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4808.900000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4809.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4810.660000000001s)]
*  Son, they really oughta knew blacks. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4811.5s)]
*  Yeah, Asians call for that black shit. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4812.740000000001s)]
*  Crazy, dude. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4814.9800000000005s)]
*  So wait, so we got no new conflicts? [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4816.46s)]
*  No. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4818.0199999999995s)]
*  So what the fuck are we gonna do [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4819.259999999999s)]
*  when we grow tired of this one that's happening right now [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4820.62s)]
*  and we need something to satisfy our identity? [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4822.86s)]
*  Oh, we'll just start a new one. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4824.74s)]
*  We got that? [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4825.9s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4826.74s)]
*  Okay, at least we're gonna start one. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4827.58s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4828.42s)]
*  But where can we start it [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4829.259999999999s)]
*  where it's really gonna galvanize? [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4830.62s)]
*  Like, where do, hmm. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4832.54s)]
*  In article. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4835.139999999999s)]
*  I was thinking. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4836.74s)]
*  Could be fun. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4838.0599999999995s)]
*  But we need like different color people going at it [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4838.9s)]
*  so it's easy for us to pay attention and know who. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4841.58s)]
*  In Africa. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4844.299999999999s)]
*  China's taking over Africa, they're buying up all Africa. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4845.62s)]
*  Oh. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4847.900000000001s)]
*  That's a problem. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4848.740000000001s)]
*  So Africa versus China. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4849.58s)]
*  That's a real fucking problem. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4850.42s)]
*  Oh, that could be fun. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4851.26s)]
*  We step in, help Africa, like, [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4852.1s)]
*  yeah, we gonna help you get your land back. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4853.34s)]
*  Oh. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4855.740000000001s)]
*  We buy it up. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4857.34s)]
*  Yeah, that's far. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4859.18s)]
*  Actually, that's really interesting. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4860.02s)]
*  It's like a better foster family. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4861.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4862.58s)]
*  So we, so okay, this is, [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4864.62s)]
*  I would definitely be into Africa versus China. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4866.9400000000005s)]
*  Most of those proxy wars are that happening already. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4871.26s)]
*  So it's like China's just propping up one group [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4876.780000000001s)]
*  and America's propping up another group. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4879.9800000000005s)]
*  And so we're letting them fight it out. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4881.820000000001s)]
*  But it's really just us propping up those groups. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4883.22s)]
*  Well, why has anybody told us about this? [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4886.06s)]
*  This makes me so upset. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4887.62s)]
*  I could've totally been virtuous [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4889.780000000001s)]
*  and talked about this on this podcast. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4891.26s)]
*  No? [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4893.7s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta stay focused on the one initiative, dude. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4894.54s)]
*  Damn it. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4897.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4898.06s)]
*  Damn. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4898.900000000001s)]
*  Apparently China and North Korea, [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4899.74s)]
*  I was talking to some dude, [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4901.099999999999s)]
*  I didn't really know anything about this. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4901.94s)]
*  They don't really like each other. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4902.78s)]
*  North Korea and China? [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4904.38s)]
*  Like they're allies, [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4905.38s)]
*  cause they have to protect any type of like Western, [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4906.3s)]
*  Western influence getting on the border. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4908.94s)]
*  So North Korea is just essentially a border wall for China, [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4910.9s)]
*  Western influence in China. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4914.98s)]
*  And China doesn't want North Korea [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4915.82s)]
*  cause North Korea is a destitute country. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4917.38s)]
*  We don't want more destitution. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4919.82s)]
*  We've already fixed our own relationship with them [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4921.82s)]
*  than we have with them. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4924.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4925.139999999999s)]
*  We still can't trust them. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4926.58s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4927.7s)]
*  And yeah, he don't talk no shit about China. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4928.7s)]
*  But maybe Trump can go flip him, dude. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4931.22s)]
*  I mean, that would be... [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4932.78s)]
*  That would be... [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4933.62s)]
*  If he gets North Korea. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4934.46s)]
*  Yo, imagine we turn North Korea into something. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4935.78s)]
*  Into the 51st state or whatever. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4937.94s)]
*  Wow. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4939.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4940.22s)]
*  Turn that shit into South Korea North, dog. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4941.0599999999995s)]
*  Come on, dog, be fired. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4943.099999999999s)]
*  Exactly, just relocate it like they do in Bushwick. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4944.98s)]
*  South Korea North. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4947.099999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4947.94s)]
*  Yeah, call it East America. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4949.26s)]
*  That would be, or yeah, or give it to Taiwan, like no cop. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4950.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4954.54s)]
*  Where could we move Taiwan? [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4955.5s)]
*  Hypothetically. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4957.46s)]
*  Like all the people or the whole place? [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4959.1s)]
*  Show me, go ahead. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4960.38s)]
*  All the people. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4961.38s)]
*  Like if we had to, if like China was like, [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4962.22s)]
*  we really want this land, and we're like, okay, [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4963.78s)]
*  like I guess, but we like the Taiwanese [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4965.86s)]
*  and we want to protect them [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4968.74s)]
*  and we like that they make these chips. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4970.62s)]
*  So where can we relocate? [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4973.14s)]
*  23 and a half million people, just so you know. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4975.02s)]
*  That's how many are moving. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4978.26s)]
*  I mean, Wyoming's obvious. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4979.78s)]
*  What you gotta get? [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4981.06s)]
*  We could put them in Wyoming. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4982.18s)]
*  Yeah, Wyoming, Montana, either Dakota. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4983.02s)]
*  We could take 23 million Taiwanese very easily. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4985.98s)]
*  Send them to Rice University or something? [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4989.419999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4990.9s)]
*  Yeah, there's something we can do. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4991.74s)]
*  I feel like we got options. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4994.58s)]
*  Look how big Kazakhstan is. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4995.419999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but we can't move them here. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4997.259999999999s)]
*  I imagine the terrain sucks. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=4998.74s)]
*  Kazakhstan? [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5000.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5001.7s)]
*  You think so? [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5002.54s)]
*  That's why it's not more densely populated? [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5003.36s)]
*  It's tall mountains. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5004.2s)]
*  It's beautiful, you gotta see it. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5005.04s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5006.299999999999s)]
*  But I'm saying in terms of inhabitation, [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5007.139999999999s)]
*  inhabitants, inhabitation, habitation? [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5008.74s)]
*  You might be right, or maybe it's really hard to invade. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5010.78s)]
*  So maybe it's like a lot of mountains [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5012.94s)]
*  that make it difficult for other countries [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5015.139999999999s)]
*  to come in and get it. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5016.94s)]
*  And then they're like, [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5018.0599999999995s)]
*  do we really wanna traverse these mountains? [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5018.9s)]
*  There's also no port or resources. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5020.62s)]
*  Yeah, it's just landlocked. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5022.86s)]
*  Yeah, but all the stands are that way. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5024.0199999999995s)]
*  Beautiful, unbelievably pretty country. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5026.58s)]
*  I mean, there's this guy that I watch his videos [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5028.62s)]

*  You're right. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5077.9800000000005s)]

*  We are all, yeah, we are all completely [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5087.26s)]
*  locked into our algorithms, [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5093.700000000001s)]
*  and the algorithms decide what we're interested in [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5095.58s)]
*  and what we want to go see, [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5097.9400000000005s)]
*  because I know the video that Miles has watched [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5099.9s)]
*  that made him wanna go to Turkmenistan. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5103.0599999999995s)]

*  and why you're interested in it. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5119.36s)]
*  I've seen the same thing, so it's sending me that as well. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5120.62s)]
*  I'd watch the guy try to get in. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5123.7s)]
*  Oh, that video, I've seen it. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5125.46s)]

*  like a definitely beautiful. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5130.34s)]
*  So like to, you're more likely to get the visa [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5132.179999999999s)]
*  if you're clean shaven, [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5135.179999999999s)]
*  which is like an insane little trick. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5136.42s)]
*  And I was like, what an awesome thing. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5138.58s)]
*  I wanna shave my face, do I have to go to, [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5139.74s)]
*  like that's awesome. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5141.26s)]
*  They don't want no more muzzies in there, bro. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5142.099999999999s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5143.74s)]
*  That's how you keep out terrorists. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5144.58s)]
*  We would never do that. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5145.66s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5146.54s)]
*  I mean, it's crazy. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5147.74s)]
*  I mean, speaking of the algorithm shit, [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5148.58s)]
*  can I talk about these cults? [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5149.42s)]
*  Yes, please. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5150.54s)]
*  This is fascinating. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5151.38s)]
*  I had no idea. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5152.2s)]
*  So back in the day, if you wanna start a cult, [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5153.04s)]
*  guess how you had to do it? [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5154.38s)]
*  You had to find people. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5155.7s)]
*  You had to go meet someone, you had to have an idea, [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5157.0199999999995s)]
*  and it could only go as fast. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5160.58s)]
*  You had to be charismatic. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5161.42s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5162.26s)]
*  Really, you just had to be charismatic. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5163.1s)]
*  But you have to meet people in person. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5163.94s)]
*  But you had to put the work in, [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5164.78s)]
*  you had to go talk to someone on the street. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5165.62s)]
*  Which is scary for people. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5167.06s)]
*  It's all grassroots, like it's word of mouth, [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5167.9s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5169.7s)]
*  On the street, boots on the street. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5170.66s)]
*  I did not realize all the cults now were digital. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5172.14s)]
*  The old school cult way of like meeting a guy, [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5175.0199999999995s)]
*  hey, come to my thing, [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5177.38s)]
*  we'll all hang out and talk about consciousness. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5178.34s)]
*  I didn't think about it. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5179.74s)]
*  It's all digital and it's crazy. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5180.58s)]
*  So let me paint a picture, okay? [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5182.58s)]
*  So, for example, there's a woman, okay? [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5184.66s)]
*  She's like a five year old kid [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5187.46s)]
*  and she just had a newborn, okay? [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5188.46s)]
*  She feels kind of sick, she's having postpartum issues, [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5189.86s)]
*  her body's not good, she's inflamed, dah dah dah. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5192.0599999999995s)]
*  She goes to the doctor, the doctor says, [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5193.9s)]
*  hey, you're overthinking it, this is nothing. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5195.26s)]
*  You know, it's overblown. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5197.18s)]
*  They gaslight her. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5198.58s)]
*  What does she do? [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5199.46s)]
*  She finds a mommy group on Facebook. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5200.3s)]
*  She goes on Facebook and she's like, [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5201.98s)]
*  hey, I'm having all these problems, dah dah dah. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5203.18s)]
*  The group's like, hey, don't eat processed food. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5204.86s)]
*  Work out, you know what I mean? [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5206.7s)]
*  Take care of your health, take these vitamins. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5207.78s)]
*  All stuff that's good. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5209.38s)]
*  She all of a sudden feels way better. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5210.62s)]
*  She's like, these doctors don't know [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5212.26s)]
*  what the fuck they're talking about. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5213.26s)]
*  This mommy group saved me. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5214.14s)]
*  And the mommy group has like 10,000 people on Facebook. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5215.34s)]
*  And then all of a sudden they say, [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5217.7s)]
*  hey, you just fixed your body, how about you fix your spirit? [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5218.54s)]
*  That's more important. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5222.02s)]
*  And then they bring her into an inner group [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5223.54s)]
*  inside that group that has like 500 people. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5225.06s)]
*  And on the inner group they're like, [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5227.26s)]
*  hey, you need to unpack your trauma, buy this course. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5228.54s)]
*  The course is like 50 bucks [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5230.54s)]
*  and it's just like hours of her talking about it. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5231.66s)]
*  That's not too bad. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5233.06s)]
*  Yeah, you're talking about your trauma unpacking stuff. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5233.900000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5235.780000000001s)]
*  So now she's unpacking her trauma, she's like, [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5236.62s)]
*  hey, I think maybe I was abused by my parents. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5238.18s)]
*  And no matter what happened to them, [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5239.9800000000005s)]
*  they believed. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5242.0199999999995s)]
*  So it's like, hey, my dad neglected me, obviously abuse. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5242.86s)]
*  Hey, my dad hugged me a lot, was that abuse? [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5245.179999999999s)]
*  And they're like, she was obviously grooming you. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5247.0199999999995s)]
*  And this is a real case of a real person [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5248.98s)]
*  that's doing this shit, it's wild. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5250.82s)]
*  And so now she gets into the whole thing. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5252.34s)]
*  She's like, oh, this is wild. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5253.78s)]
*  Hey, my son's like wetting the bed, [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5254.7s)]
*  what should I do for that? [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5256.0199999999995s)]

*  Who's abusing my kid? [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5258.86s)]

*  hey, my husband thinks that you're crazy [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5267.82s)]
*  and she's like, that's exactly what an abuser would say. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5271.74s)]
*  So now the woman's like, oh shit, what do I do? [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5274.139999999999s)]

*  and you can get into this community. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5288.5s)]
*  Don't tell your husband. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5289.9s)]
*  She packs up all her shit, drives down to Florida [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5290.94s)]
*  and just leaves her whole family, blocks the number. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5292.86s)]

*  And then she's like, okay, [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5339.94s)]
*  it's been two years that this has been happening. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5341.0599999999995s)]
*  She's only able to communicate with this lady. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5342.7s)]
*  All the posts that go into the Facebook group [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5344.74s)]
*  have to be approved by her. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5346.3s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5347.34s)]
*  So if you put in something that's like, [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5348.179999999999s)]
*  I think I was abused, the woman would be like, [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5349.0s)]
*  hey, you need to figure out your stuff. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5350.259999999999s)]
*  I'm not gonna approve this. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5351.78s)]
*  But then she goes, I definitely was abused. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5352.78s)]
*  And then all of a sudden all the people in the group [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5354.86s)]
*  are like, hey, so was I, I'm with you, da da da. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5355.9s)]
*  They're all backing each other up. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5358.299999999999s)]
*  Now they're like super, super tight. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5359.259999999999s)]
*  And then all of a sudden she's like, hey, it's Thanksgiving. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5360.78s)]
*  I'm actually gonna go spend time with my family, [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5362.48s)]
*  but I'm afraid what they're gonna think of my lifestyle. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5364.179999999999s)]
*  They don't like that I moved. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5366.0599999999995s)]
*  And the woman goes, hey, they're not gonna understand you. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5367.139999999999s)]
*  Tell them what we've been talking about, [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5369.299999999999s)]
*  and I'm telling you right now, they're not gonna get it. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5370.46s)]
*  They're on a low consciousness, [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5372.0199999999995s)]
*  and you're on an ascended consciousness, [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5373.66s)]
*  they're not gonna get it. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5374.86s)]
*  So then she goes back to Thanksgiving, [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5375.7s)]
*  and she's like, yeah, you know, the lunar orbit [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5376.66s)]
*  with the Saturn and my chakras are healed. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5378.5s)]
*  Stop talking to them. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5384.9s)]
*  And now she's completely integrated into the group. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5386.0199999999995s)]
*  And then maybe one day she's like, you know what, [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5387.9s)]
*  I'm gonna take my kids and try to go rekindle [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5390.299999999999s)]
*  my relationship with my husband. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5391.78s)]
*  I'm gonna go back, right? [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5392.66s)]
*  She tells the woman, hey, I'm gonna actually [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5394.86s)]
*  go back with my husband. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5396.74s)]
*  She goes, if you go back, you're giving in [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5397.5599999999995s)]
*  to the Luciferians, and I'm going to buy up, [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5399.34s)]
*  I've already bought up your name on every single domain. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5401.98s)]
*  So if anyone Googles your name, [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5404.639999999999s)]

*  it's all gonna be there. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5413.219999999999s)]
*  So she's like, fuck, I can't get out. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5415.0599999999995s)]
*  And then if you try to get out, [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5417.179999999999s)]
*  which a lot of these people have, [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5418.46s)]

*  It's all happening on these little micro groups [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5429.34s)]
*  and encrypted channels, and they're all sending money [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5431.259999999999s)]
*  to this woman who doesn't even live in Florida, [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5432.88s)]

*  Yeah, like where did she go to in Florida? [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5440.34s)]
*  So they send her to a community, [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5442.34s)]
*  because they have like lax laws on like kidnapping [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5443.7s)]

*  I was trying to shut it down. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5489.38s)]
*  It tricked me. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5490.22s)]
*  I'll tell you guys all the, yeah. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5491.06s)]
*  But no, he like just publishes it [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5491.9s)]
*  and tries to like put attention on it, [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5492.9400000000005s)]
*  because technically it's not like illegal. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5493.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5495.46s)]
*  Because it's this huge gray area [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5496.3s)]
*  where they go to the woman, they go, hey, like. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5497.14s)]
*  Blackmail's illegal. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5498.78s)]
*  She threatens to blackmail. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5499.74s)]
*  Well, that's where the illegal stuff happens, [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5501.0199999999995s)]
*  but most people don't even come out to even say that. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5502.62s)]
*  Meaning the organization of the people, [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5504.9s)]
*  the right to assembly or whatever is in the constitution. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5506.74s)]
*  Right? [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5509.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5509.98s)]
*  So then, and like freedom of speech, [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5510.82s)]
*  freedom of religion protects a lot of it. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5511.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5512.74s)]
*  And so then they go to the woman, they're like, hey, [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5513.58s)]
*  like is your, why'd you leave, why'd you kidnap your kids? [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5514.74s)]
*  She goes, I didn't kidnap my kid. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5516.86s)]
*  My kids were being abused by my husband. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5518.099999999999s)]
*  And then they interview the kid, and the kid's like, [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5519.7s)]
*  yeah, I think I was abused. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5521.219999999999s)]
*  Because she starts convincing the kids. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5522.62s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5524.62s)]
*  And so now there's like thousands of these cults. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5525.7s)]
*  Be careful, you Mario. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5527.54s)]
*  That's the thing. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5528.379999999999s)]
*  There are enough idiots in this world [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5529.22s)]
*  that will believe this kind of shit. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5531.02s)]
*  Like, yeah, there's a lot of stupid people, bro. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5532.46s)]
*  And I actually thought there was way less. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5537.62s)]
*  No, it's a staggering number. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5539.7s)]
*  No, it's crazy. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5541.66s)]
*  It sounds kind of saying to say, but there is like, [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5542.780000000001s)]
*  and when I mean stupid, like I'm stupid, [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5544.54s)]
*  you guys are stupid, but there's another level below. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5548.66s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5553.66s)]
*  Like where it's like, can't even really think for themselves, [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5554.5s)]
*  but they're still operating. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5557.66s)]
*  They're still in the world. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5559.78s)]
*  And that, those motherfuckers are dangerous. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5562.0599999999995s)]
*  Those motherfuckers are dangerous [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5566.74s)]
*  because they're easily susceptible to this type of stuff. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5568.139999999999s)]
*  And oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it is crazy. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5571.34s)]
*  And it's like three prongs. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5574.42s)]
*  So it's like the people can get. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5575.3s)]
*  But people are nothing than these fucking idiots. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5576.139999999999s)]

*  Yo, I'm being honest with you. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5613.34s)]
*  These girls, it's not it. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5614.74s)]
*  Those girls are so the ones you're bringing up, [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5616.62s)]
*  they're so self indulgent. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5618.42s)]
*  And they stink. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5620.22s)]
*  But sometimes they do, but like a lot of time they starfish. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5621.42s)]
*  Like they're so the ones that are like doing this [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5624.900000000001s)]
*  to be a model, they're so self indulgent [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5626.860000000001s)]
*  that they can't even go, what would make that person happy? [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5629.42s)]
*  There's a version of this girl. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5633.02s)]
*  Like this girl is kind of a caricature [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5635.660000000001s)]
*  of the one that we're all kind of thinking. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5637.22s)]
*  Right, but there's a version where it's just like, [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5639.1s)]
*  please, I need to please, how can I please. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5641.14s)]
*  Those girls are the ones that they throw down. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5643.1s)]
*  And it's compulsive. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5645.34s)]
*  It's like they're pathological about their need to please. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5646.82s)]
*  And then head is one of them. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5650.3s)]
*  And it's just fantastic, it's sensational. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5651.46s)]
*  It's truly sensational. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5654.06s)]
*  It's sensational, it's a crazy thing. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5655.42s)]
*  They're a gift. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5658.5s)]
*  So that's what happens, bro. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5659.42s)]
*  You get locked down with one of these girls, [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5660.38s)]
*  almost she's running off with a colt. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5661.54s)]
*  But you gotta be careful, man, who you're not in, dude. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5663.82s)]
*  It is a. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5666.02s)]
*  Yeah, it just sucks that she took the kid. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5667.42s)]
*  If she just went off and did some stupid coofoo shit. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5669.02s)]
*  Oh, that's a blessing, Doug. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5671.18s)]
*  You got this dumb bitch out of your life. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5672.02s)]
*  But she took my kid who's half dumb. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5673.42s)]
*  Taking the kid is great. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5675.46s)]
*  Yeah, and they use the kid as a fear tool [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5676.299999999999s)]
*  to get you fucking out of there. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5677.379999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5678.5s)]
*  So yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5679.339999999999s)]
*  But you gotta pick them back, bro. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5680.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5681.0199999999995s)]
*  No, that shit is crazy. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5683.94s)]
*  But what do you do? [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5685.099999999999s)]
*  Like, what do you do? [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5685.94s)]
*  You know how there are certain people [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5687.58s)]
*  that can be hypnotized? [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5688.78s)]
*  It's like not everybody, but there are certain people. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5690.58s)]
*  Like, I wonder if it's a version of that. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5692.98s)]
*  That shit's a little gay. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5694.98s)]
*  We had a hypnotist come to my school, [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5696.5s)]
*  and he hypnotized like eight people on stage. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5697.74s)]
*  And then like three people in the crowd passed out. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5699.62s)]
*  Because they were also hypnotized. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5702.179999999999s)]
*  That sucks, dude. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5703.62s)]
*  How do you get hypnotized watching? [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5705.26s)]
*  That's some real cuck shit, dude. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5706.1s)]
*  And then the hypnotist was like, [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5707.66s)]
*  see, look, they get it. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5708.5s)]
*  I was like, what? [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5709.9s)]
*  But how wouldn't that work? [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5710.74s)]
*  Wouldn't everybody in the room, [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5711.9s)]
*  if you're susceptible to hypnosis, [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5713.22s)]
*  wouldn't everybody in the room, [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5715.18s)]
*  not just the ones in the front, [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5716.34s)]
*  because they're hearing all the same shit. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5717.74s)]
*  But that's the point. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5719.02s)]
*  Some of the people that were just watching, [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5719.86s)]
*  the ones that were susceptible. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5721.38s)]
*  They pick the ones that they think [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5722.38s)]
*  will be easily hypnotized. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5724.06s)]
*  There's a way to filter them out. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5725.58s)]
*  There's ways. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5726.86s)]
*  I imagine, right? [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5727.7s)]
*  Because let's say, for example, you can't be. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5728.54s)]
*  And Mark can't be. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5731.14s)]
*  But me and Akash can. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5732.34s)]
*  Then we'd be all up on stage, [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5734.0199999999995s)]
*  it would only work for half of us. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5735.379999999999s)]
*  So I'm sure there's a way. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5736.86s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5738.139999999999s)]
*  That's how we get it. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5738.98s)]
*  I actually don't think it's IQ. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5739.82s)]
*  I think, like, for me. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5741.179999999999s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5742.0199999999995s)]
*  It's a completely different thing. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5742.86s)]
*  They said that about, [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5744.54s)]
*  I think RFK was saying that about [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5745.379999999999s)]
*  the guy that killed his dad. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5747.82s)]
*  The scale of your ability to be hypnotized [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5751.379999999999s)]
*  is like one to five. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5754.299999999999s)]
*  Or something like that. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5755.54s)]
*  And the guy who killed his dad was a 6.5. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5756.66s)]
*  Some insane off the Richter scale, if you will. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5760.82s)]
*  And they were saying that's why he might have been [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5764.66s)]
*  susceptible to MKUltro, which was those experiments. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5767.179999999999s)]
*  How do you let someone take over your brain? [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5770.5s)]
*  Come on. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5772.5s)]
*  It's a little good. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5773.34s)]
*  But isn't happening. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5774.179999999999s)]
*  All the people that are crazy in politics, [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5775.42s)]
*  on both sides, the ones that are like, [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5779.9s)]
*  they root for it like they're rooting for sports. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5782.0199999999995s)]
*  It's like, that's a little too much. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5784.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's a level of hypnosis. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5786.179999999999s)]
*  That's why, like, [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5788.299999999999s)]
*  that's why, yo. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5789.66s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5791.86s)]
*  Rooting for a sports team is still something. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5792.7s)]
*  But like, we'd go in, though. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5794.7s)]
*  But that's why we're progressive. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5796.74s)]
*  No, no, no, no, he's right, though. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5797.58s)]
*  He's right, though. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5798.34s)]
*  Like, rooting for the sports team makes sense, right? [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5799.18s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5802.54s)]
*  It's great. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5803.46s)]
*  It's cultish. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5804.3s)]
*  Sure, but like the stakes are low. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5805.3s)]
*  Yeah, no repercussions. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5807.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5808.9s)]
*  And there's no control and like intimidation. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5809.74s)]
*  You can leave freely. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5810.98s)]
*  Yeah, you can leave freely. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5811.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5813.34s)]
*  Yeah, I should be able to leave freely. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5815.5s)]
*  That's my whole point. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5817.18s)]
*  Fucking forgetting me. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5818.0199999999995s)]
*  But like when it becomes your whole identity, [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5820.26s)]
*  and especially when it comes to the politics stuff, [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5823.78s)]
*  when it just becomes your whole identity. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5825.9400000000005s)]
*  Life, bro. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5828.26s)]
*  But that's what we're talking about with the, [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5829.14s)]
*  you know, there's some motherfuckers out there [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5831.18s)]
*  which like, they have no interest. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5832.54s)]
*  And I don't wanna say majority, but like, [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5835.02s)]
*  put it this way. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5837.82s)]
*  One thing that I think is really fun. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5838.74s)]
*  Say it, nah, say it. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5840.18s)]
*  No, no, one thing that's really fun, [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5841.02s)]
*  and I'm gonna say it, [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5843.1s)]
*  but one thing that's really fun about, [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5843.9400000000005s)]
*  I think, our podcast is, [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5844.9400000000005s)]
*  we like to indulge in the crazy conspiratorial shit, right? [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5846.54s)]
*  We have Billy Carson on. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5849.78s)]
*  And I'll be honest, [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5851.46s)]
*  90% of the shit he was saying is probably bullshit, right? [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5852.86s)]
*  Like I'm literally watching it, [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5856.02s)]
*  I'm like, there's no fucking way, [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5857.34s)]
*  but I love it, it's fun, it's interesting. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5858.46s)]
*  I'm like watching an episode of like sci-fi. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5860.3s)]
*  Maybe 20%, maybe 40% is real. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5862.26s)]
*  Maybe there's some truth into it, but who fucking knows? [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5864.74s)]
*  I'm not going like, these are the facts, right? [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5867.1s)]
*  Even Graham Hancock's on all these other guys, [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5869.74s)]
*  I'm like, tell me what this could be, [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5871.54s)]
*  and let's just indulge. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5873.34s)]
*  It's a fun little fantasy, right? [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5874.3s)]
*  And I like indulging it. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5877.14s)]
*  But I also think that we'll have people on where we go, [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5878.26s)]
*  hey, tell us what you think of the world, [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5880.74s)]
*  because we're interested in truth. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5882.9s)]
*  We're interested in ideas that go against the grain, [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5884.1s)]
*  for sure, but we're also interested in what we might feel [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5886.62s)]
*  is the truth. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5890.54s)]
*  And then we take all these different ideas [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5891.58s)]
*  and we kind of balance them. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5893.42s)]
*  And being comedians, we kind of maybe are more intrigued [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5894.46s)]
*  by something that hasn't been said. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5897.74s)]
*  We're intrigued by like a line of thinking [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5899.5s)]
*  that isn't necessarily our own. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5901.3s)]
*  Even if we disagree with it, we're like, [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5903.54s)]
*  ooh, no, no, no, he's kind of spinning, [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5905.26s)]
*  what the fuck is that? [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5906.46s)]
*  The Anunnaki is here? [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5907.3s)]
*  Maybe there's Anunnaki. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5908.46s)]
*  We like going outside of our emotions. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5909.820000000001s)]
*  But, and this is recently comes around, [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5913.54s)]
*  I think that people really do not like [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5917.9400000000005s)]
*  going outside their emotions. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5919.9800000000005s)]
*  And it's to the point where I think that [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5921.54s)]
*  they really just want their emotions satisfied. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5924.9800000000005s)]
*  And the internet is a fascinating thing. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5927.14s)]
*  And Mark and I were discussing this, [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5929.740000000001s)]
*  which is like, before the internet, [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5931.26s)]
*  if you wanted to grift, right? [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5933.1s)]
*  You had to figure out the grift. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5935.38s)]
*  How do you figure out the grift? [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5937.660000000001s)]
*  You don't know how many people are reading [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5939.26s)]
*  an article in the newspaper. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5940.58s)]
*  Maybe you knew how many books were sold, [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5941.9400000000005s)]
*  but you gotta write a whole book. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5944.22s)]
*  You gotta write a whole book, [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5945.860000000001s)]
*  but even before you write the book, [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5946.740000000001s)]
*  you gotta see if this book is really being sold a lot [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5947.900000000001s)]
*  and where is it being sold. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5950.42s)]
*  Now, not only does the internet tell you [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5951.900000000001s)]
*  where the grifts are, it tells you [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5955.22s)]
*  from the content you're making what you can grift on. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5958.46s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5963.1s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5963.9400000000005s)]
*  It's like the algorithm. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5964.780000000001s)]
*  And the views are right there [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5966.18s)]
*  so you know how big the audience is. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5967.38s)]
*  The algorithm pushes you in the direction [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5969.02s)]
*  of what it wants you to create, right? [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5972.5s)]
*  So if you don't have some real integrity [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5975.18s)]
*  in yourself as a creative, [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5977.14s)]
*  all you want is successes, all you want is numbers, [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5980.860000000001s)]
*  it's very easy to just kind of follow that. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5982.9400000000005s)]
*  And I think that's what a lot of people [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5985.02s)]
*  will end up doing, right? [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5986.5s)]
*  You see it, they just pop on certain trends, right? [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5987.9800000000005s)]
*  It's like, you even see it in comedy, right? [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5990.46s)]
*  Like, we'll put out some stand-up clips, [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5993.34s)]
*  then we'll put out a special, [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5995.7s)]
*  and then we put out the crowd work stuff. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5997.5s)]
*  And then when people saw that was popular, [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=5999.02s)]
*  they're like, oh, I'm gonna put out crowd work now. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6000.7s)]
*  I'm chasing what I think the people like [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6003.02s)]
*  instead of creating the thing that you want to create. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6005.46s)]
*  And then they'll even complain that they gotta do it. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6009.9400000000005s)]
*  And it's like, fam, go invent some shit, loser. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6012.14s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6015.78s)]
*  Why don't you create the next trend that people do [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6016.900000000001s)]
*  instead of begrudgingly following the thing [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6019.7s)]
*  because you were a slave to the algorithm? [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6022.46s)]
*  Create the new algorithm, you know? [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6024.54s)]
*  But the algorithm will dictate to the weak-minded creatives [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6026.82s)]
*  what they should be creating, [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6032.0599999999995s)]
*  because all they want is numbers. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6033.34s)]
*  They don't want actual, true, authentic creation. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6035.58s)]
*  And in a way, [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6039.82s)]
*  the people that are consuming [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6043.139999999999s)]
*  are actually manipulating the creators [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6046.179999999999s)]
*  and not the grifters manipulating the innocent people. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6048.18s)]
*  I think it becomes a flywheel. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6053.42s)]
*  They perpetuate. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6054.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they perpetuate themselves. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6055.62s)]
*  But I guess what I used to think is people were naive, [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6056.54s)]
*  and then they go and they watch some video. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6059.18s)]
*  People were neutral, and then they get pushed this way. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6061.66s)]
*  And they get pushed this direction. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6063.5s)]
*  But largely, people are here, and I wanna stay here, [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6064.700000000001s)]
*  and that's that. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6067.66s)]
*  Keep me in my echo chamber. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6068.5s)]
*  I just wanna hear what I wanna hear. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6069.54s)]
*  I don't think the neutral people get radicalized. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6071.14s)]
*  I used to think that that was possible, [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6075.3s)]
*  and like, oh my God, look what happened. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6076.86s)]
*  And they get caught in these rabbit holes, [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6078.139999999999s)]
*  and then we lost another one. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6079.46s)]
*  I actually think it's people that already feel these things, [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6080.9s)]
*  and they already are maybe easily hypnotized, if you will. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6085.219999999999s)]
*  There's some folks out there, and they already feel it, [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6091.34s)]
*  and they're just searching for the validation. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6093.5s)]
*  And then they search in for the validation [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6095.139999999999s)]
*  for their opinions and their feelings. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6097.139999999999s)]
*  And then you have that sweet algorithm [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6098.74s)]
*  where they don't have to search very far. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6100.46s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6101.78s)]
*  And then once you watch the whole video, [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6102.62s)]
*  the algorithm's already like, [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6104.5s)]
*  all right, well, here's five more videos about this. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6105.66s)]
*  And all of them tap into something you're feeling, [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6107.58s)]
*  even though they're different. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6110.66s)]
*  So if you're anti-establishment, [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6112.08s)]
*  you got 20 different reasons why you can be anti-establishment. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6113.38s)]
*  And then it starts populating your brain with arguments. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6116.22s)]
*  And you can see these people, [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6119.0599999999995s)]
*  you can see the people that are the easiest [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6120.98s)]
*  to be grifted on, [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6123.099999999999s)]
*  because they all have the same talking points. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6123.94s)]
*  Like, if you were regurgitating [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6126.7s)]
*  the same three or four things, I don't care what it is. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6128.9s)]
*  It could be politics, it could be about fishing, [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6132.0199999999995s)]
*  but if you all have the same three things, [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6134.42s)]
*  what you are as a person who felt something, [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6137.7s)]
*  you couldn't really describe your feelings, [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6140.42s)]
*  a video satisfied those feelings with arguments, [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6143.18s)]
*  and now you're just spouting them. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6146.86s)]
*  And so it's, but this has never happened before. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6148.9800000000005s)]
*  Think about that. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6151.9400000000005s)]
*  Back in the day, in order to grift, you had to get lucky. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6152.86s)]
*  Yo, this is why you can't, [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6155.5s)]
*  when everyone, whenever one of the truth comes out [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6158.46s)]
*  on one of these red pill guys, [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6161.06s)]
*  and you're like, oh, that's the end of him, [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6162.26s)]
*  it's not the end of him, because the audience, [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6163.9s)]
*  well, the audience still wants to hear that content. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6166.46s)]
*  So they don't care if you were, [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6168.66s)]
*  if you had X, Y, and Z, [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6170.82s)]
*  you did it in your phone. Exactly, it was never about him. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6171.98s)]
*  Just keep feeding me the content I wanna see. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6173.54s)]
*  That's the thing, it's never about the person. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6175.86s)]
*  It's about the utility that that person offers you. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6177.98s)]
*  What you need is your feeling satisfied and validated. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6181.259999999999s)]
*  And as long as that person satisfies and validates them, [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6184.42s)]
*  then he's still useful to you. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6187.58s)]
*  A lot of times, these people don't even love the grifters. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6189.179999999999s)]
*  They don't care about them. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6192.259999999999s)]
*  They just satisfy them emotionally. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6194.52s)]
*  The second the grifters change, or culture changes, [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6195.4400000000005s)]
*  they're like, oh, fuck that guy, we don't need that guy, [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6199.64s)]
*  or fuck that girl, we don't need that girl. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6201.56s)]
*  And the really shrewd grifters [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6203.200000000001s)]
*  keep on changing their grift with culture. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6205.4800000000005s)]
*  And they're constantly adjusting. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6209.0s)]
*  All of a sudden, they're talking about this new thing. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6210.84s)]
*  And all of a sudden, they're talking about another thing. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6213.72s)]
*  And all of a sudden, and they've never spoken about it [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6216.04s)]
*  before, but they're really passionate about it all of a sudden. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6217.76s)]
*  When I see that, I'm like, oh, this is, [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6221.04s)]
*  this motherfucker is committed to the grift. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6223.0s)]
*  And sometimes, they don't even know they are. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6225.24s)]
*  They see themselves as heroic. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6227.84s)]
*  So it is an interesting thing that kinda happens, [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6231.08s)]
*  where it's like, if you're truly, [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6234.4s)]
*  you care about creating authentically, [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6237.04s)]
*  sometimes the thing you authentically care about [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6238.62s)]
*  lines up with culture, and then you have this [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6240.72s)]
*  amazing lightning rod moment, right? [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6243.4800000000005s)]
*  Because you really care about it, [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6245.68s)]
*  and culture really needs it, and boom, we're right there. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6247.0s)]
*  And then sometimes, culture moves in a different direction, [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6249.72s)]
*  and you're not passionate about that thing. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6252.2s)]
*  And if you all of a sudden jump over, [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6254.24s)]
*  because you're like, oh, I just need the views, [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6255.76s)]
*  I need to do it, we could have on a different version [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6257.58s)]
*  of Billy Carson every single week, [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6260.16s)]
*  and it would be a five million view episode [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6261.28s)]
*  every single time. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6262.76s)]
*  That's not what the show is. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6263.599999999999s)]
*  We like indulging in that, and then we wanna speak [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6265.2s)]
*  to some guy running for president. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6266.88s)]
*  That's what's fun, because we like the different ideas, [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6268.16s)]
*  and I think we curated an audience [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6270.5199999999995s)]
*  that, for the most part, also enjoys that. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6272.599999999999s)]
*  They like indulging in the wild shit, [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6275.48s)]
*  but then they also wanna hear some truth and some real shit. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6277.44s)]
*  It's so easy to just make money doing that. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6281.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6283.839999999999s)]
*  It really is, but it is a choice. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6284.92s)]
*  This guy was saying some of these cult leaders [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6287.5199999999995s)]
*  don't mean to be cult leaders. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6289.12s)]
*  They post their little course about how to heal [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6290.96s)]
*  your inner chakra or whatever, and then people are like, [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6293.679999999999s)]
*  hey, you cured me of cancer. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6295.599999999999s)]
*  Hey, you helped me escape abuse, and you're like, [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6297.08s)]
*  oh, this shit is fine, and then you double down. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6298.639999999999s)]
*  And then people are coming to you more and more and more, [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6300.44s)]
*  and they're buying more courses, [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6302.46s)]
*  and then all of a sudden this spirals for 10 years, [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6303.879999999999s)]
*  and then you become a cult leader. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6306.0s)]
*  Honestly, a lot of them, I don't blame them in any way, [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6308.320000000001s)]
*  because I think that they might not know it. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6311.04s)]
*  Just like that example, it might be their genuine passion, [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6313.6s)]
*  they might truly believe. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6317.0s)]
*  Billy, I feel like believes it. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6318.56s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6320.64s)]
*  I truly believe it, so I'm not going, [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6321.4800000000005s)]
*  oh, we're knocking this dude, [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6322.88s)]
*  and I think the most effective ones [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6324.2s)]
*  are the ones that are committed, they truly believe it. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6325.56s)]
*  But there are ones who you could tell are just jumping. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6328.320000000001s)]
*  My antennas go up whenever they're selling some course [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6330.92s)]
*  or something like that. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6333.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6334.52s)]
*  Like, if you're selling anything, [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6335.360000000001s)]
*  if you just believe in something, believe, [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6336.6s)]
*  and you should spread the word. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6338.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6339.400000000001s)]
*  But if there's money attached to it, I'm like. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6340.240000000001s)]
*  The second you got a course, yeah, I'm skeptical. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6341.56s)]
*  I'm trying to think of what the psychology is [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6344.160000000001s)]
*  of the person who goes toward that thing. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6346.120000000001s)]
*  Talk to us. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6348.8s)]
*  I don't know, I think there is some level of, [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6349.64s)]
*  I don't know if trauma is the right word, [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6352.200000000001s)]
*  but some level of hurt in feeling something [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6353.56s)]
*  that pushes you toward a certain grifter [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6356.4400000000005s)]
*  and a certain thing, and then once you find that, [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6359.280000000001s)]
*  and it resonates with you, now that's all I wanna hear. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6362.120000000001s)]
*  Red pill guys, not the people preaching, [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6365.28s)]
*  but the people following, are hurt by women. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6368.08s)]
*  I could have easily been one of those. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6370.88s)]
*  Easily. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6372.76s)]
*  I wasn't getting any girls, I was whatever. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6373.599999999999s)]
*  And then there's some anger and hurt there, [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6375.36s)]
*  and if this thing makes you feel better about it, [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6377.719999999999s)]
*  and it leads to a little bit of success, [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6379.5199999999995s)]
*  even if it's fleeting success, I'm in, [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6381.48s)]
*  and that's all I wanna hear. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6383.599999999999s)]
*  I don't care who the fresh and fit, whatever the drama is, [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6385.12s)]
*  I don't give a fuck, because they're telling me [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6387.96s)]
*  what I want to hear. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6389.5599999999995s)]
*  As long as the utility is there. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6390.4s)]
*  I give everything, I'm in. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6391.24s)]
*  And if it's not you, if you quit, I'm finding someone else. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6392.08s)]
*  And that's why I couldn't, you put this into perfect words, [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6394.92s)]
*  because I couldn't figure out, [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6398.56s)]
*  I never really blamed Fox News, [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6399.4s)]
*  because the audience was fucking there. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6401.88s)]
*  You're telling them what they wanna hear. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6403.84s)]
*  They need it. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6405.32s)]
*  They need it, and there was another thing I was trying to, [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6406.16s)]
*  I couldn't remember, I can't even remember the example. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6408.0s)]
*  And then Fox will flip flop, [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6408.84s)]
*  depending on who the front runner is, [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6410.38s)]
*  and you know why they do? [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6412.4s)]
*  Because the audience, [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6413.52s)]
*  They're not evil, they're not puppet. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6415.32s)]
*  Yeah, I'm telling me the truth, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6416.76s)]
*  We like Trump, tell me why Trump is good. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6418.56s)]
*  And then everybody at Fox gets in line, [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6420.88s)]
*  I've done shows with these guys, [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6423.04s)]
*  I've seen them off camera, talked to them off camera, [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6424.24s)]
*  had them all tell me that Trump is a bozo, [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6427.599999999999s)]
*  and then seen them- [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6430.24s)]
*  Tucker. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6431.08s)]
*  Lick Trump's balls. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6431.92s)]
*  Tucker. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6432.76s)]
*  When they say, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6433.599999999999s)]
*  And that, to be fair- [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6434.42s)]
*  But not just Tucker. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6435.26s)]
*  Yeah, all of them. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6436.28s)]
*  And to be fair to him, I used to really judge him for that, [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6437.12s)]
*  but as we're having this conversation, [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6439.5199999999995s)]
*  yeah, he's giving the people what they wanna hear. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6441.2s)]
*  If I don't give it to them, someone else will. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6443.08s)]
*  Fox didn't get to number one in the ratings, [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6445.12s)]
*  because they manipulated it. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6447.12s)]
*  They got to number one, [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6448.8s)]
*  because nobody was telling these people [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6449.719999999999s)]
*  what they wanted to hear. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6451.719999999999s)]
*  Every other news was going one way, [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6452.88s)]
*  and they said, oh, there's a whole group of people [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6454.400000000001s)]
*  that wanna hear something else. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6456.4800000000005s)]
*  Let's just feed that market. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6457.84s)]
*  Big gray space, let's just feed it what they wanna hear. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6459.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6461.76s)]
*  The people will tell you what they need. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6462.6s)]
*  I'm curious, as a Catholic, [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6464.24s)]
*  how do you feel when you see adults [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6465.36s)]
*  getting baptized and converting? [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6469.2s)]
*  Do you see that as grifting, [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6470.88s)]
*  or are you happy that more people are joining? [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6472.9800000000005s)]
*  Like that the people that are getting baptized are grifting? [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6476.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6478.64s)]
*  No, I mean, I see it as people looking for community [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6479.6s)]
*  and purpose, and they found this religion [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6482.759999999999s)]
*  that gives them that. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6484.8s)]
*  So whether they convert to Islam, [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6486.42s)]
*  assuming that they're good faith actors, [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6487.599999999999s)]
*  then I see it as them just being able to subscribe [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6489.0s)]
*  to some type of greater mission. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6491.36s)]
*  Because I recently saw a video with, [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6493.5199999999995s)]
*  who was the guy we had on Russell Brand? [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6496.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6498.04s)]
*  So he was very- [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6498.88s)]
*  Oh, Russell, Russell. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6499.8s)]
*  Russell's casting that Christian griff right now. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6500.639999999999s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6503.04s)]
*  When we spoke to him, he was very Buddhist, [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6504.0s)]
*  all that shit. Eastern, yeah. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6507.12s)]
*  Oh, he saw that. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6508.759999999999s)]
*  Didn't they get married in India, him and Katy Perry? [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6509.599999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6512.08s)]
*  Yeah, they got married in India. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6512.92s)]
*  So when you see that, that doesn't kind of upset you. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6513.740000000001s)]
*  I'm like, I would look at that and be like, [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6516.68s)]
*  nah, I think you're kind of just like bullshitting. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6519.16s)]
*  That's the thing, you don't know, [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6522.04s)]
*  you can't get inside someone's mind. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6523.72s)]
*  So you can make all these speculations and be like- [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6525.16s)]
*  Which is truly, and I'm not even making a joke, [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6527.4800000000005s)]
*  that's the most God-fearing, [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6529.72s)]
*  actually religious way to look at it. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6531.66s)]
*  You have the best perspective, which is empathy and love, [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6533.400000000001s)]
*  and I can't get into, I can't assume- [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6536.200000000001s)]
*  Also, why would any Christian question it? [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6537.8s)]
*  Because if they truly believe it, [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6541.08s)]
*  why would someone else not? [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6542.56s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6544.5199999999995s)]
*  Like it almost takes skepticism of the belief [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6545.36s)]
*  in order to see it in others. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6548.44s)]
*  Of course you converted. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6550.04s)]
*  Because it- So did I. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6551.2s)]
*  Truth, it's the path. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6552.8s)]
*  It's like somebody moving to New York and going, [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6554.08s)]
*  this is the best city in the world. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6555.48s)]
*  None of us go, this motherfucker lying. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6557.28s)]
*  I do, but that's because I don't believe it already. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6559.84s)]
*  Y'all believe it already. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6561.84s)]
*  No, I'm saying us. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6562.68s)]
*  Like we are the devout New York Catholics. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6563.5199999999995s)]
*  So when anybody goes, yo, this is the one and true [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6567.4s)]
*  greatest city in the world, we go, of course. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6569.8s)]
*  Finally you see it. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6572.400000000001s)]
*  This guy's an idiot. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6573.4400000000005s)]
*  Everyone else sees it. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6575.08s)]
*  And it lines up because this city [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6576.04s)]
*  molests you every time. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6577.2s)]
*  So that actually is a perfect, perfect parallel. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6578.400000000001s)]
*  We like the abuse. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6581.4400000000005s)]
*  We like the abuse. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6582.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6583.12s)]
*  That's why. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6583.96s)]
*  Wow. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6584.8s)]
*  I do think if someone's gonna join a major religion, [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6585.64s)]
*  I think every major religion is like a good organization [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6587.28s)]
*  to be in generally. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6590.360000000001s)]
*  Like they persisted this long because they're able [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6591.2s)]
*  to sustain, like the fruits of what they preach are good. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6593.88s)]
*  Whether it's like Islam, Judaism, Christianity. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6596.88s)]
*  So I would prefer someone triple down on Catholicism [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6599.32s)]
*  or Islam than go into like some fringe, [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6601.96s)]
*  Weird cults. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6604.6s)]
*  Like random cults that I don't know anything about [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6605.44s)]
*  that's only been around 20 years [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6607.2s)]
*  and the fruits of it might be poison. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6608.24s)]
*  Gotcha. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6609.56s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6610.4s)]
*  And there might've been iterations of this [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6611.24s)]
*  that were fringe weird cults throughout history. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6612.68s)]
*  Well you could argue every religion starts as a cult. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6616.6s)]
*  But to your argument about time, [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6619.16s)]
*  time starts to weed out the shit [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6621.28s)]
*  that doesn't really offer utility. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6623.56s)]
*  So now a few thousand years later, you're like, [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6625.6s)]
*  okay, this might have some things [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6627.72s)]
*  that are a little bit difficult to do, [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6629.240000000001s)]
*  but the community is fucking great. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6630.64s)]
*  I feel great when I go to church. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6632.240000000001s)]
*  You help people, treat your neighbors yourself. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6633.400000000001s)]
*  Everybody can have a run. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6635.16s)]
*  Champing can have a run. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6636.12s)]
*  Nike, been here. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6637.2s)]
*  I trust Nike. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6638.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6639.8s)]
*  So it's almost like a Darwinian selection [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6640.64s)]
*  of like the product of it. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6642.2s)]
*  Like it's not, yeah, go, go. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6644.12s)]
*  Some cult that started in 2000 [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6645.2s)]
*  and everyone's getting abused [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6646.76s)]
*  and they're taking all the money from people [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6648.280000000001s)]
*  and there's a death cult and they're killing each other off. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6649.72s)]
*  Like that's not gonna last more than a decade. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6652.68s)]
*  I want us to have the cult of people [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6654.88s)]
*  who enjoy information they might not agree with, [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6657.04s)]
*  like to hear it out, willing to change their minds, [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6661.4s)]
*  willing to make a new opinion. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6664.24s)]
*  Like the cult of, what is that shit I was talking about [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6666.0s)]
*  in the beginning of the episode that I am? [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6670.36s)]
*  Prisoner of the moment. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6672.68s)]
*  Prisoner of the moment. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6673.5199999999995s)]
*  That's what we should have. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6674.68s)]
*  Prisoner of the coolest information [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6676.6s)]
*  that you just heard, cult. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6678.2s)]
*  But I do really want that. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6680.08s)]
*  And I think maybe I thought everybody is like this [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6681.4s)]
*  because the people that I've ended up becoming friends with [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6684.24s)]
*  are all like this. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6686.64s)]
*  Like we say different ideas, maybe we agree, [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6687.4800000000005s)]
*  maybe we don't, we discuss them. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6689.96s)]
*  Maybe I'm convinced, maybe I'm not convinced, [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6691.4800000000005s)]
*  maybe you're convinced. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6693.280000000001s)]
*  And it's like a really fun way to go about shit. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6694.320000000001s)]
*  And it could be about sports that mean nothing. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6696.4400000000005s)]
*  It could be about life that's really important. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6698.72s)]
*  But for us, that's always been the kind of dialogue. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6701.04s)]
*  And everybody says they want that. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6704.56s)]
*  They're like, let's share ideas. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6706.400000000001s)]
*  And the best idea will win. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6708.400000000001s)]
*  And everybody says that. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6710.08s)]
*  But based on what is being consumed, [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6711.88s)]
*  if you look at right-wing people [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6714.6s)]
*  are only consuming right-wing shit, [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6716.160000000001s)]
*  and left-wing people are only consuming left-wing shit, [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6717.96s)]
*  and they're both spouting this nonsense, [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6720.200000000001s)]
*  then we should be able to have conversations. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6721.96s)]
*  When are y'all listening to the convos? [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6723.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6726.64s)]
*  Right? [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6727.4800000000005s)]
*  One thing I try to do is when I see a headline [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6728.320000000001s)]
*  that really excites me and I want to believe it, [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6730.6s)]
*  actually read the fucking article before you decide. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6733.0s)]
*  This headline confirms everything I believe in. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6736.08s)]
*  I don't need to read the article. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6737.92s)]
*  If you read the article nine times out of 10, [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6738.88s)]
*  you're gonna be disappointed. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6740.6s)]
*  Maybe I got shit. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6741.8s)]
*  They say if there's a question mark [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6742.68s)]
*  in the title of the article, it's always no. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6744.96s)]
*  So it's like, does Pakistan still exist? [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6749.52s)]
*  And you get hyped. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6751.76s)]
*  You're like, what? [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6752.6s)]
*  And then it's like, yeah, no, no, no, no. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6753.4400000000005s)]
*  Did they get rid of Pakistan? [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6756.12s)]
*  No, they didn't. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6757.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6758.200000000001s)]
*  But, yeah. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6759.04s)]
*  Are Pakistanis bad people? [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6760.68s)]
*  No, they're not. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6762.360000000001s)]
*  They're just worse than us. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6764.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6765.320000000001s)]
*  But yeah, it is a, like I wonder if kids will grow up [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6766.160000000001s)]
*  in this information age and have the ability to discern [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6771.04s)]
*  between the grift and the truth. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6774.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6779.2s)]
*  And I wonder if they'll develop that in the same way [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6780.04s)]
*  that we developed the ability to discern [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6782.48s)]
*  between a real phone call from somebody [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6785.16s)]
*  and like a Nigerian prince that needs $10,000 [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6788.6s)]
*  and you get to get the inheritance. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6791.28s)]
*  Like our parents don't know really about that. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6793.4s)]
*  So they get caught. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6795.96s)]
*  We don't get caught, because we're like, that's ridiculous. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6797.04s)]
*  Now they're getting us with AI using our own voices [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6798.84s)]
*  and being like, your sister's kidnapped. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6801.04s)]
*  Yeah, I think the grift evolves. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6802.72s)]
*  I think whatever these kids are gonna get tricked by [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6804.320000000001s)]
*  or shit they don't know about yet, [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6806.400000000001s)]
*  and their next generation will laugh at them for it. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6807.72s)]
*  If you told me 10 years ago, [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6810.320000000001s)]
*  there's gonna be con artists calling in your mom's voice [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6811.6s)]
*  with AI saying, send me money. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6814.4800000000005s)]
*  I'd be like, what the fuck are we? [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6815.84s)]
*  It's not a sci-fi movie. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6817.0s)]
*  And they're gonna look at our grifts and be like, [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6818.56s)]
*  when you're telling the story, the whole time I was like, [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6820.64s)]
*  this bitch is on Facebook? [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6823.08s)]
*  You're a fucking, what are you, 90? [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6824.56s)]
*  Of course it's you're gonna get conned on Facebook. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6826.8s)]
*  They're gonna say that about us [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6828.92s)]
*  with AI phone calls or whatever. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6830.08s)]
*  Sure. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6831.360000000001s)]
*  But then they'll have their thing. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6832.2s)]
*  He said like the remedy, [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6833.360000000001s)]
*  if someone's trying to get into a cult, [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6834.4800000000005s)]
*  there's no real definition of a cult. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6836.2s)]
*  Like to me, it's kind of just like [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6837.68s)]
*  transparency of information and then control. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6839.24s)]
*  Like if they're like, oh, you can't leave, [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6841.4400000000005s)]
*  or like you can only communicate through like me [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6843.04s)]
*  or ex people, then I'm like, okay, it's probably a cult. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6845.4400000000005s)]
*  But he's like, if someone's interested, [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6848.04s)]
*  and they're like, hey, I'm gonna go [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6850.2s)]
*  to this like a consciousness retreat [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6851.04s)]
*  and I'm gonna go enlighten my thing, [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6852.56s)]
*  he's like, support them. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6854.280000000001s)]
*  He's like, it sounds counterintuitive, [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6856.0s)]
*  but like back them up, [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6857.16s)]
*  because that goes against the programming. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6858.08s)]
*  The programming is, [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6859.64s)]
*  everyone's against us. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6860.64s)]
*  They're not gonna get you, they're gonna call you crazy. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6861.48s)]
*  And when they come back from the retreat, [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6863.52s)]
*  be like, so how was it? [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6864.56s)]
*  What'd you guys talk about? [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6865.4s)]
*  And be like open-minded and genuinely curious, [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6866.24s)]
*  because then that goes against what they're telling us. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6868.0s)]
*  It's like, oh wow, that's clever. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6869.56s)]
*  So I think that's the- [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6871.36s)]
*  What if they come back saying some wow shit, [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6872.2s)]
*  you have to be like, oh, that's nice. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6873.76s)]
*  Yeah, you ask them. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6875.56s)]
*  Be like, oh yeah. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6876.4s)]
*  And like, and why did they, [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6877.24s)]
*  why can you only talk to the group leader [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6878.44s)]
*  and why can they only approve your information? [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6880.6s)]
*  And you can leave if you want. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6883.08s)]
*  And they're like, oh well technically. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6884.200000000001s)]
*  And then by asking the questions without being critical, [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6885.76s)]
*  they start realizing themselves, [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6888.8s)]
*  whoa, this is a little bit controlling. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6890.400000000001s)]
*  This is- [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6892.8s)]
*  We have to hope that they- [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6893.64s)]
*  We would hope. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6894.4800000000005s)]
*  But then again, yeah, some people just are going [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6895.320000000001s)]
*  through something that's so fucking difficult. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6898.0s)]
*  It's the same thing with drugs. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6900.320000000001s)]
*  It's like, you see a lot of people are drug addicts, [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6901.4800000000005s)]
*  and if you've never had some of your family [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6903.120000000001s)]
*  or like a loved one that was addicted, [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6905.200000000001s)]
*  like it's hard to understand. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6907.280000000001s)]
*  But what they're going through is so gut wrenching. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6908.84s)]
*  They can't even really fathom what life is like [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6913.0s)]
*  without the drug. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6917.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6917.96s)]
*  Like it's just so hard. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6918.8s)]
*  So I think the same thing happens with maybe a cult. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6919.64s)]
*  It's like, it's just, what they're dealing with [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6921.6s)]
*  is so fucking horrible. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6923.360000000001s)]
*  And that's the only thing that makes them feel [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6924.72s)]
*  like a little bit less bad. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6926.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6928.68s)]
*  So you have empathy for these people that get, [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6929.52s)]
*  it's not get tricked. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6932.4800000000005s)]
*  Because again, they're getting the thing they want, [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6934.04s)]
*  which is that little moment of feeling good. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6936.72s)]
*  That they don't have. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6939.6s)]
*  So I used to think it was them getting tricked. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6940.4400000000005s)]
*  It's not really, and especially not anymore. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6942.280000000001s)]
*  Like these are the people seeking out the thing [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6944.88s)]
*  that they really fucking want. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6946.56s)]
*  Like I remember in Nick's group chats every single season, [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6948.16s)]
*  we had the best fucking team in the league. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6951.64s)]
*  I wanna hear that. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6953.64s)]
*  Every, you know what I'm saying? [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6954.92s)]
*  Like this is the information I want. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6955.92s)]
*  So we gotta, the way that we look at our sports teams, [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6958.2s)]
*  people are looking at politics, they're looking at life, [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6960.92s)]
*  they're looking at every decision. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6964.360000000001s)]
*  And yeah, it's crazy. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6966.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6969.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6973.5199999999995s)]
*  So I think that's the only thing you can do, [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6974.92s)]
*  is arm the people with the tools to know, [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6975.92s)]
*  is this a cult? [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6978.679999999999s)]
*  Is what I'm doing completely dogmatic? [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6979.759999999999s)]
*  Also the tools to understand a grift. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6981.4s)]
*  Like to understand what that is. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6985.44s)]
*  What that, and why. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6987.28s)]
*  And again, it's not to say that these people [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6989.639999999999s)]
*  that are doing a grift are even aware of it. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6991.719999999999s)]
*  Yep. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6994.44s)]
*  And you see someone bounce into every new trendy thing. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6996.919999999999s)]
*  Also if we nourish and love all of the people around us, [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=6999.639999999999s)]
*  they're less likely to seek one of those things. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7003.24s)]
*  It all starts at home, ain't it? [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7006.12s)]
*  Fucking sad thing. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7007.36s)]
*  That's your community you could affect. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7008.2s)]
*  But then if you're looking beyond it, [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7009.679999999999s)]
*  you're just like, okay, like what is the thing? [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7011.879999999999s)]
*  Like how do you help not just your community? [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7016.16s)]
*  Or how do you like affect positively, not just your community? [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7019.5599999999995s)]
*  I think the way that we thought things worked [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7022.56s)]
*  with Freedom of Speech, I think, [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7026.8s)]
*  the conversation was always like, [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7028.4400000000005s)]
*  put all the ideas out there and the best ideas win. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7029.68s)]
*  Like that was this idea, right? [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7032.04s)]
*  And what nobody's really admitting [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7033.76s)]
*  is that's kinda not how it works. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7037.0s)]
*  You put all the ideas out there [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7039.88s)]
*  and then people just gravitate to whatever ideas [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7041.400000000001s)]
*  make them feel good. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7043.84s)]
*  So knowing that, obviously I don't know a better system [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7045.400000000001s)]
*  than having free speech. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7049.88s)]
*  I'm the biggest free speech advocate. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7050.76s)]
*  We need free speech to the end. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7052.52s)]
*  I love it. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7053.92s)]
*  And I do think that there are good ideas out there [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7054.76s)]
*  that people eventually attach to. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7056.6s)]
*  But it is something that we at least have to look at. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7058.360000000001s)]
*  Like I would love to talk to Elon about this. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7061.4800000000005s)]
*  Capitalism is the best economic system. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7062.68s)]
*  That doesn't mean there are flaws in capitalism [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7064.320000000001s)]
*  that can be exploited. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7065.92s)]
*  Free speech is the best system for speech, [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7067.0s)]
*  but that doesn't mean that it can't be exploited. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7069.52s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7071.4800000000005s)]
*  Capitalism is a good way of looking at it. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7072.320000000001s)]
*  It's like the best, healthiest food [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7073.92s)]
*  isn't the food that's always consumed. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7078.08s)]
*  The food that makes you feel good is what gets consumed. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7080.76s)]
*  But sometimes that food that makes you feel good [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7085.12s)]
*  can be bad for you, bad for society in a whole. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7087.8s)]
*  My hope is with more polarization, [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7091.64s)]
*  open convo eventually swings it back. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7093.88s)]
*  Because we're still looking in the micro, [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7095.6s)]
*  where the internet's only been around [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7097.2s)]
*  two decades or something. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7099.04s)]
*  So it's like I'm hoping on the macro [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7100.24s)]
*  with enough time that goes by, [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7102.08s)]
*  people are like, oh, we're gonna slowly swing back. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7103.08s)]
*  Like these things we thought made us feel good [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7105.2s)]
*  in the short term were actually super negative. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7106.68s)]
*  I think that's a really smart way of looking at it, [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7109.6s)]
*  which is like one pendulum swings, [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7111.360000000001s)]
*  because there are cultural pendulum swings [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7114.24s)]
*  that happens all the time. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7115.96s)]
*  Example of that is I see people being critical of Rogan. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7119.8s)]
*  They're like, oh, he's all conservative right now. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7123.2s)]
*  He went to Texas, he's all conservative. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7124.76s)]
*  I really thought about it. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7126.92s)]
*  I was like, I don't know, there's a friend of mine, [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7128.08s)]
*  I know him. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7130.2s)]
*  Has he changed? [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7131.92s)]
*  My suspicion with Rogan is that he's always had [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7133.6s)]
*  maybe an aversion to authority [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7138.08s)]
*  or being told to live a certain way. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7139.96s)]
*  And I imagine when he was younger, [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7142.68s)]
*  the people telling him how to live [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7144.32s)]
*  were conservatives going, you shouldn't be doing drugs. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7146.08s)]
*  You're a puritanical people. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7149.48s)]
*  Yes, the puritanical conservative. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7150.88s)]
*  Don't be gay. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7152.12s)]
*  Don't be gay, don't whatever. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7152.96s)]
*  And then he probably rejected that. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7154.04s)]
*  Don't have tattoos, don't do this shit. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7155.92s)]
*  He rejected that, right? [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7157.56s)]
*  And that probably made him very democratic. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7159.36s)]
*  And now the people telling him what to do [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7161.8s)]
*  are liberals going, you better get this vaccine, [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7164.4s)]
*  you better do these fucking drugs, [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7167.56s)]
*  you better get in line, don't tell these jokes, [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7168.92s)]
*  these jokes are offensive. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7170.96s)]
*  So now the rejection of that positions him [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7172.320000000001s)]
*  as this person who's conservative. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7176.52s)]
*  But in reality, and I think that's why a lot of us all go, [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7178.280000000001s)]
*  well now I think I'm feeling more conservative. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7182.120000000001s)]
*  When I was younger, I was more democratic. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7183.92s)]
*  No, no, it's just who's telling you how to live. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7185.400000000001s)]
*  And whoever's telling you how to live, [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7189.400000000001s)]
*  if you have a little bit of a free spirit, [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7191.14s)]
*  you start going, well, I don't like you telling me [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7193.160000000001s)]
*  how to live. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7196.639999999999s)]
*  So I'm gonna look at these guys over here [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7197.48s)]
*  and see if they're telling. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7198.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7199.36s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7200.2s)]
*  Yeah, I'm trying to wrap my mind around this idea [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7201.04s)]
*  and I couldn't, I wanted to figure it out [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7202.88s)]
*  ideally before Rogan even bring it there. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7204.84s)]
*  But like, I'm kind of letting go of this idea [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7206.48s)]
*  that there are political parties. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7209.08s)]
*  I think there's just personality profiles [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7210.38s)]
*  or personality types. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7212.88s)]
*  Cause the extremes, oh, we've all said this, [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7214.599999999999s)]
*  the extreme conservative and the extreme liberal, [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7216.0s)]
*  it's the same personality type. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7217.8s)]
*  We are not special or smart or whatever. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7219.719999999999s)]
*  We're just a different personality type [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7222.2s)]
*  that might be the anti-authoritarian, [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7224.08s)]
*  don't tell me what to do personality type. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7227.28s)]
*  I've been trying to figure this out [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7228.76s)]
*  and I don't even think we have that many political beliefs [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7229.88s)]
*  that we truly feel as much as our personality profile [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7233.2s)]
*  lends itself to this thing in this moment in time. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7236.96s)]
*  Yeah, what is happening culturally [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7239.16s)]
*  and how does it impact our identity? [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7240.72s)]
*  And then depending on how it impacts our identity, [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7242.8s)]
*  whoever's defending our identity will gravitate to [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7246.04s)]
*  and whoever is rejecting our identity, [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7248.84s)]
*  we'll move away from. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7251.64s)]
*  And I think black people probably felt this way. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7253.44s)]
*  They're like, oh wow, Democratic party is really like [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7255.2s)]
*  kind of listening to our concerns about like racism [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7257.48s)]
*  and the civil rights movement. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7260.28s)]
*  And they all gravitated towards that, right? [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7261.48s)]
*  And I think maybe even now they're like, [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7263.919999999999s)]
*  all right, have they done much for us since then? [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7266.48s)]
*  And maybe they have, I don't know, but there's a little- [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7270.04s)]
*  We are looking at it like, wait a minute, [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7272.32s)]
*  we keep supporting this party, [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7274.04s)]
*  but we're not getting anything out of it. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7276.16s)]
*  You know what, our vote isn't guaranteed anymore. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7277.7s)]
*  And then, and that in simply is just an identity thing, [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7280.0s)]
*  which is like, hey, who's gonna help us? [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7282.4s)]
*  And I think a lot of people behave in that way. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7284.719999999999s)]
*  And then since we look at American politics as a binary, [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7287.839999999999s)]
*  we start going, oh, you're a conservative [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7290.96s)]
*  or you're whatever. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7293.799999999999s)]
*  It's like, no, no, we didn't change. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7294.62s)]
*  Maybe our identities changed a little bit, sure. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7296.2s)]
*  And the things that we value change. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7298.04s)]
*  You have a family and then all of a sudden [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7299.24s)]
*  that's a concern. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7300.679999999999s)]
*  But who we are hasn't really changed that much. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7301.7s)]
*  How the different political parties [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7305.5199999999995s)]
*  are impacting us has changed. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7308.839999999999s)]
*  And we will always just gravitate towards the one [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7312.04s)]
*  that feels like they're not telling us what to do [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7314.400000000001s)]
*  or at least supporting the way that we wanna live. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7316.360000000001s)]
*  And I think that that might, [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7319.12s)]
*  I think there's something there. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7320.88s)]
*  So it's not like, I'm in the middle. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7322.24s)]
*  Like, no, we're not in the middle. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7324.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7325.8s)]
*  It's just culture has changed [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7327.12s)]
*  and the way that the parties are talking, [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7328.92s)]
*  the things that they're branding themselves around change. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7330.96s)]
*  And as that happens, we pivot. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7333.92s)]
*  Trans wasn't an issue in the fucking 40s. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7337.52s)]
*  In the early 2000s. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7340.24s)]
*  So it's like the parties couldn't argue about that. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7342.64s)]
*  And now if that is a major issue for you, [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7345.56s)]
*  you're gonna lend yourself [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7347.84s)]
*  to whatever party's more supportive. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7349.16s)]
*  If you're a Jewish person and you're super pro-Israel, [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7352.280000000001s)]
*  that's really important identity for you. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7354.820000000001s)]
*  You're gonna go to whatever side is more supportive. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7356.68s)]
*  So it's not this in the middle position [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7361.360000000001s)]
*  that people talk about all the time. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7364.4400000000005s)]
*  And conservatives in the 90s [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7366.0s)]
*  were the anti-free speech people burning the rap CDs, [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7368.16s)]
*  NWA, we hate that. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7371.48s)]
*  Now conservatives are super free speech. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7372.72s)]
*  It's a really weird shift that's happened. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7374.44s)]
*  Can people act like we're the ones changing? [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7376.76s)]
*  No, the parties change. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7378.86s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7381.48s)]
*  Like what the party's value changes. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7382.32s)]
*  How much of that is a reflection of us though? [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7384.88s)]
*  You would think more, [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7386.96s)]
*  but since conservatives have like flip-flopped [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7388.2s)]
*  on what it is you can and can't say, [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7390.36s)]
*  have they realized that their constituents [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7393.72s)]
*  feel a different way? [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7395.64s)]
*  That's what I think. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7396.48s)]
*  So they're reacting to the- [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7397.96s)]
*  They're the griffers. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7398.8s)]
*  They're telling us what we wanna hear. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7400.24s)]
*  They're reacting to the algorithm. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7401.599999999999s)]
*  And as we tweet as conservatives, [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7403.2s)]
*  their trademark or whatever, [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7407.5599999999995s)]
*  like hallmark beliefs might be pro-gun, pro-life maybe, [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7409.84s)]
*  for example. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7414.36s)]
*  Everything else is negotiable. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7415.32s)]
*  Whoever is the fucking, [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7417.0s)]
*  the guy that has the highest profile, [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7419.36s)]
*  that is pro-life and pro-gun, [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7421.48s)]
*  whatever else they say, I'm with that too, [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7423.24s)]
*  cause they're with those two things. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7424.96s)]
*  Those are the things I care about the most. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7426.5199999999995s)]
*  So maybe that's what it is. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7428.599999999999s)]
*  And then if they see that like, [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7430.280000000001s)]
*  if the other politicians that are conservative [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7432.04s)]
*  see conservatives care about this the most [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7433.96s)]
*  and they're following these guys, [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7435.4400000000005s)]
*  all right, we're with all that shit too. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7436.56s)]
*  It's crazy out here, dog. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7438.68s)]
*  It's really wild out here. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7440.56s)]
*  Yeah, but it is good to have these convos. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7442.2s)]
*  These, I think it is like uncharted territory [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7445.0s)]
*  for us old dudes. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7449.68s)]
*  Like you probably grew up with this, [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7451.320000000001s)]
*  but us old dudes that are like, [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7452.64s)]
*  we're kind of analyzing and seeing [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7454.360000000001s)]
*  how this is working in real time. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7456.04s)]
*  Information was very easy for us growing up. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7458.400000000001s)]
*  Like I don't think your generation realizes that. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7461.240000000001s)]
*  Like what was true and what was not true [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7466.400000000001s)]
*  was definite and decided. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7469.400000000001s)]
*  Like there was very little gray area. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7473.240000000001s)]
*  I mean, did you, I felt, [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7479.0s)]
*  what I feel now with information. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7480.64s)]
*  Overwhelmed. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7482.92s)]
*  Is overwhelmed. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7483.76s)]
*  When I was young, I knew everything. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7485.08s)]
*  I knew nothing. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7488.12s)]
*  But I had the illusion of feeling like I knew everything. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7489.64s)]
*  Because there was only one source. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7492.320000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7493.68s)]
*  And then you just kind of, I don't believe in that. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7494.52s)]
*  And now there's 50 sources. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7496.4800000000005s)]
*  And they weren't even that far. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7497.320000000001s)]
*  Like the sources were. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7498.16s)]
*  One of the biggest things I've noticed [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7498.9800000000005s)]
*  is that when we were younger, a fact was a fact. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7499.820000000001s)]
*  Now my fact is different from your fact. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7502.360000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, what is that? [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7505.280000000001s)]
*  We live in our own reality. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7506.72s)]
*  The arrogance that we have. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7508.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's correct. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7509.0s)]
*  The arrogance. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7510.0s)]
*  I think people could benefit [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7510.84s)]
*  from learning how media is taught. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7512.08s)]
*  And in media school, they teach you [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7514.56s)]
*  that there's fact and then there's truth. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7516.52s)]
*  And truth is fact through a perspective. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7519.64s)]
*  Ah, yeah. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7522.360000000001s)]
*  And a lot of people don't know the difference [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7523.280000000001s)]
*  between a fact and a truth. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7526.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7528.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I didn't until you said that. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7529.56s)]
*  So we just learned it right now. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7532.320000000001s)]
*  But it is true. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7534.4800000000005s)]
*  And these are the things that you gotta kind of. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7535.320000000001s)]
*  That's media school day one. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7536.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7539.280000000001s)]
*  But how crazy is that? [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7540.120000000001s)]
*  That now you gotta educate kids on the media [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7540.96s)]
*  just so that they can digest it. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7543.040000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7545.240000000001s)]
*  I'm telling you, man, there's this, [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7546.5599999999995s)]
*  you always say it, ignorance is bliss. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7549.36s)]
*  And it was, consuming media back in the day [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7551.599999999999s)]
*  was way more blissful. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7555.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7557.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7558.12s)]
*  Are the Chinese happier than us? [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7558.96s)]
*  So I think about that, right? [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7560.28s)]
*  We gotta go full China, dude. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7562.92s)]
*  So I think about that. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7564.2s)]
*  I think there's a way that they might be simply, [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7565.04s)]
*  and this is, I think, why they restrict [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7567.5599999999995s)]
*  so much information that comes from the West. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7568.92s)]
*  If they have nothing to compare themselves to, they might. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7571.08s)]
*  But Western media and content is so sexy. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7575.2s)]
*  Like, it's just, you can't. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7579.599999999999s)]
*  Dopamine, dopamine, dopamine. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7583.28s)]
*  It's just the best. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7584.68s)]
*  Like, it's just the best. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7586.28s)]
*  Like, why would you wanna live any other way? [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7587.5199999999995s)]
*  Like, I'm sorry, you can't. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7589.28s)]
*  You just fucking can't. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7590.599999999999s)]
*  Like, it's the best. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7591.5199999999995s)]
*  The things we reward are the best. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7594.12s)]
*  I was watching that Three Body Problem movie. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7595.92s)]
*  Oh, it was good. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7597.599999999999s)]
*  And it's interesting culturally in that, like, [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7598.44s)]
*  all the characters that are like the heroes [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7600.24s)]
*  are heroes because they're smart. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7602.84s)]
*  And the ones that aren't, and the heroes, [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7605.6s)]
*  they have to sacrifice themselves and die [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7607.320000000001s)]
*  because they weren't smart enough. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7609.92s)]
*  Like, they really reward intellect, and it's important. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7611.68s)]
*  In America, it's like, the smart guy usually says [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7614.84s)]
*  something condescending to the tough guy, [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7617.6s)]
*  and the tough guy punches him in the face [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7619.72s)]
*  and then fucks his girl. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7621.4800000000005s)]
*  And that's awesome. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7623.4400000000005s)]
*  Arnold Schwarzenegger's our biggest guy. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7624.400000000001s)]
*  He's like, yeah, he just shoots everyone. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7626.240000000001s)]
*  He's jacked, he's awesome. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7627.68s)]
*  Isn't that great? [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7628.8s)]
*  That's how you solve every fucking problem. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7629.64s)]
*  It's just awesome. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7631.4400000000005s)]
*  And the reality is more people can relate [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7633.72s)]
*  to not being the smartest guy. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7635.8s)]
*  And a smart guy being condescending to them. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7637.68s)]
*  And in that moment, being frustrated, [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7639.8s)]
*  you're like, this fucking guy thinks he's smarter than me. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7641.16s)]
*  I'm gonna punch him in his fucking face. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7643.2s)]
*  Doesn't his white girl know I can pump fake on her? [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7644.04s)]
*  That's it! [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7645.68s)]
*  This rich white bitch that's sitting front row [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7647.320000000001s)]
*  doesn't know the rules of the game, [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7649.72s)]
*  is doing cry faces to me? [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7650.84s)]
*  She getting swung on. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7653.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7656.08s)]
*  It's wild out here. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7656.92s)]

*  Okay, what else we got, guys? [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7658.6s)]
*  I know that you guys got some cool shit [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7659.6s)]
*  that you want to show us. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7660.96s)]
*  Oh yeah, we were talking about AI just a second ago. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7661.8s)]

*  Wait, really? [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7721.92s)]

*  Gus and like, some middle-aged people. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7723.8s)]
*  Hold on, is this a trick? [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7725.92s)]
*  No. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7727.52s)]
*  Is that like me as a girl or something? [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7728.36s)]
*  No, that'd be way better. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEOrvMtyGU&t=7730.0s)]
