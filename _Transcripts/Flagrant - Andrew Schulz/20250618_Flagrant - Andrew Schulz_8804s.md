# History Hyenas on Israel & Iran, Kanye is MLKs Dream, & the History of the Ottoman Empire
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8)
*  If you've flown Air India once and that was your second time flying Air India, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=4.28s)]
*  I have no sympathy for you. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=5.12s)]
*  I have no... [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=6.44s)]
*  Like you chose that... [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=7.12s)]
*  Can I repeat? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=7.84s)]
*  Because I know... [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8.52s)]
*  Why is it so bad? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=9.08s)]
*  The planes are janky as f... [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=9.64s)]
*  Like you'll see first class seats, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  just like rips in them with duct tape over them. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=12.84s)]
*  So you think it was the plane, it wasn't pilot error. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  How could it be pilot error? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=17.8s)]
*  You think they tried to fly it out? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=19.0s)]
*  The guy hit the wrong button, I decided I don't know aviation. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=20.68s)]
*  That's the same with... [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=23.2s)]
*  Yeah, you see. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=24.32s)]
*  The possible Pakistan was impossible. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=25.32s)]
*  That's what I thought immediately. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  That kid said he wanted to become pilot. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=28.279999999999998s)]
*  Pilot. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=30.04s)]
*  Yeah, he's a pilot, great! [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=30.84s)]
*  That was his dream job. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=32.56s)]
*  My only question is how did that one guy survive? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=35.839999999999996s)]
*  Now I don't know. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=38.599999999999994s)]
*  How? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=39.4s)]
*  He said he jumped out. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=39.92s)]
*  And they for sure verified it was him. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=40.96s)]
*  They verified his passport, allegedly verified his plane ticket, his name. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=43.0s)]
*  What are the chances they just grabbed somebody and they're like, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=46.76s)]
*  this would be a cool story. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=48.599999999999994s)]
*  You know, we can tell the difference. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=49.599999999999994s)]
*  Also, like, I could buy an Indian passport at a vape shop. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=51.04s)]
*  So it's like... [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=53.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=54.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=55.6s)]
*  Chrissy Dee and Yachty Chomp is on the pod. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=56.8s)]
*  Have you seen how this has turned into a 9-Eleven conspiracy? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=60.68s)]
*  By the way, people online are like... [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=64.16s)]
*  Because now you can see the building and it just looks like a plane [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=66.4s)]
*  with the tail sticking out of just like a two-story building. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=69.84s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=72.16s)]
*  It doesn't penetrate. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=72.68s)]
*  It's just sitting there. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=74.0s)]
*  So they're like, how the fuck did these two buildings go down? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=74.92s)]
*  The plane looked like a white guy trying to dunk. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=77.36s)]
*  And he's just like, I can't get to the rim. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  So, oh, wow. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=81.4s)]
*  So they're saying there's no way that the twin towers could have gone down. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=82.48s)]
*  So now everyone's like, how is it possible that this happened [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  with these massive buildings reinforced with steel beams? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  Well, luckily, we have two engineering experts on the podcast. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=89.08s)]
*  Engineering, history. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=91.36s)]
*  We're definitely Middle Eastern experts. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=92.8s)]
*  So how did the plane get stuck? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=95.24s)]
*  Can we figure that out? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=97.16s)]
*  The plane got stuck because all of the South Asian geniuses [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=98.08s)]
*  who were Indian are in America. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=102.6s)]
*  Oh. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=104.12s)]
*  We took all their engineers. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=105.24s)]
*  Bright drain. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  So they couldn't even fly a plane through a building. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=107.92s)]
*  Yeah, if you're a good Indian, you're here. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=109.64s)]
*  This is the NBA. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=111.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=112.52s)]
*  The Indian. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=113.04s)]
*  United States. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=113.76s)]
*  It's like if you're a good black person, you're in the United States. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=114.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=117.52s)]
*  Indians are killing it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=118.0s)]
*  The best of the best get here. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=120.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=121.12s)]
*  The best right here. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=122.4s)]
*  We got one of the better ones sitting right here. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=123.16s)]
*  Yeah, that is true. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=124.8s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=125.64s)]
*  So I just think it was one of those situations where that becomes evident [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=126.28s)]
*  when they try to fly a plane and you're just like, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=129.56s)]
*  should have hired Akash for that. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=132.28s)]
*  I also imagine Air India might be the type of airline [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=134.44s)]
*  where they just pack so many people in, like people are standing [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=137.36s)]
*  on the subway, you know what I mean? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=140.2s)]
*  There's handrails and maybe that's how the guy got out. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  He was standing. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=143.56s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  I won't defend Air India ever. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=144.72s)]
*  Again, I've flown it twice and I've learned my lesson. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  But there are Vistada was a really good Indian airline [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=148.95999999999998s)]
*  and then Air India bought them and I was like, now I'm out. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  Well, because this plane is like a legitimate like it's a dreamliner, right? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=155.0s)]
*  That's like a new age plane. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=158.76s)]
*  Man, it took off from Gujarat, right? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=160.44s)]
*  You don't know what kind of corners these motherfuckers be cutting. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=162.51999999999998s)]
*  Seriously, right? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=164.48s)]
*  These Gujarat these. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=165.28s)]
*  I mean, look at that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=165.92s)]
*  It didn't even go through the building. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=166.76s)]
*  Yeah, we should look at the plane and how it started. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=168.2s)]
*  I want to look at this building. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=169.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=171.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=171.68s)]
*  I mean, I guess the Twin Towers, the building is mostly glass. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=173.04s)]
*  With well, with all why the Twin Towers? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=177.28s)]
*  Why did it just go right through the Twin Towers? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=180.36s)]
*  Oh, right. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=183.52s)]
*  That steel beams. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=184.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, one through the steel beams. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=185.2s)]
*  It was still beams. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=186.56s)]
*  Maybe maybe because I don't know because here's the thing. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=187.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=191.76s)]
*  Remember, you're an engineering. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=192.28s)]
*  But I'm going to say I don't know. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=194.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=196.72s)]
*  Israel is so funny. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=197.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  It's the reason why it went through because I'm not 100% sure. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=200.04000000000002s)]
*  I'm not 100% sure if the steel beams needed to be removed on September 10th for the Israelis [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=207.36s)]
*  to put the bombs in. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=214.20000000000002s)]
*  I don't know if I don't know because I'm not I don't know if Israel was able to wire [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=214.72000000000003s)]
*  that building with bombs before. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=218.76000000000002s)]
*  That's just a question obviously. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=220.76000000000002s)]
*  So what's happening in Iran now then, guys? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=222.92000000000002s)]
*  Let's just get to the let's just get down to it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=225.16000000000003s)]
*  Who are you guys rooting for? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=227.88000000000002s)]
*  Iran is an interesting place. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  Who am I rooting for? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=230.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=232.20000000000002s)]

*  Also, the Jews, their skin is not oily. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=483.56s)]
*  If it was fucking Greeks, they're combustible. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=486.56s)]

*  No, six million Greeks. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=490.56s)]
*  Then I could understand. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=491.56s)]

*  But for me, I always think about it this way. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=7976.64s)]
*  And this is, might sound like nihilism, but it's not, is no matter what, no matter what, we have a one-way ticket to die. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=7978.64s)]
*  We are dying. Nobody's getting out of this planet alive. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=7986.64s)]
*  So if you told me suffering and depression and anxiety was going to somehow get me off that train of death, I would do it. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=7988.64s)]
*  But since either way, I'm going that way, I might as well be happy and enjoy everything because there is nothing that will save me. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=7996.64s)]
*  I accept that, but it's a very positive thing for me. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8003.64s)]
*  I think that, I think you've made some decisions in your life that are very admirable. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8006.64s)]
*  You know, like you have, you take care of a kid that's not yours. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8011.64s)]
*  My stepson, sure. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8014.64s)]
*  And have embraced him and it seems like built a relationship with his father. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8015.64s)]
*  Like, I think there are a lot of guys that are in your situation that might not do that. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8018.64s)]
*  No, because. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8022.64s)]
*  And I just want to compliment you. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8023.64s)]
*  I think that that's like a very, I think it's a courageous thing. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8024.64s)]
*  It's the right thing to do. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8027.64s)]
*  A mature thing. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8028.64s)]
*  And it's an incredibly mature thing. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8029.64s)]
*  And a lot of people aren't confronted with a decision like that. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8030.64s)]
*  And a lot of people don't have the maturity when they are. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8033.64s)]
*  To even kind of like embrace that other guy that's in the picture and make sure that that kid doesn't feel like he's not part of the family. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8036.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8042.64s)]
*  So I think that there's a lot of love in you, my man. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8043.64s)]
*  100%. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8047.64s)]
*  There's a lot of love in you. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8048.64s)]
*  Because for me, it's I look at him, my stepson, as an extension of my daughters. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8049.64s)]
*  Right. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8053.64s)]
*  I mean, that's who he is. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8054.64s)]
*  And number one, before I had children, he was, I fell in love with the woman and that was her child. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8055.64s)]
*  The most sacred thing to her. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8059.64s)]
*  So how could I, how could I not, you know, how could I discard him? [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8060.64s)]
*  You know, like he is, he's my child. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8064.64s)]
*  Fuck with me after you're 18 though. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8066.64s)]
*  Two grown men. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8068.64s)]
*  Yeah, we're just guys. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8071.64s)]
*  You're not my kid. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8073.64s)]
*  Hey guys. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8074.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8075.64s)]
*  No, I love my kids like they're my own. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8076.64s)]
*  You know, all three. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8078.64s)]
*  That's why we say on set, I have three kids. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8079.64s)]
*  How do you balance that? [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8081.64s)]
*  Like you are that person. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8082.64s)]
*  You're his stepfather. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8084.64s)]
*  You're friends with his father. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8085.64s)]
*  But like you're also someone that I imagine like he looks up to it. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8087.64s)]
*  You're someone that I imagine you have a huge responsibility in his life. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8090.64s)]
*  Like, can you, can you like reprimand is maybe the wrong word, but like, can you say that he's not doing something right? [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8093.64s)]
*  Like, do you navigate it differently with your daughters? [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8100.64s)]
*  So what I do is with him, what I do is with him. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8102.64s)]
*  I, I definitely cut him a lot more slack than his mom does, but it's his mom's more, it's his mom's role. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8104.64s)]
*  I'm the disciplinarian. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8111.64s)]
*  When I step in, I'm, it's almost very old school with it. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8112.64s)]
*  I step in and that because I understand and I always use the same word with him. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8116.64s)]
*  When I say, listen, your relationship with your father is sacred. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8120.64s)]
*  That's a sacred thing. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8122.64s)]
*  That is your father. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8123.64s)]
*  So anything you always want to go, if you're feeling conflicted, I'm telling you now, go with what your dad thinks because that is a sacred relationship. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8124.64s)]
*  And he, I say there's no one that's going to ever love you like your mom and dad. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8132.64s)]
*  Even though I love you with everything, your mom and dad, it's a sacred thing that I only understand because I have that sacred bonds with your sisters. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8135.64s)]
*  But that doesn't mean I don't. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8142.64s)]
*  I love you as much as you can imagine, but it's a thing from nature. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8143.64s)]
*  That's just something you'll understand when you have kids. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8147.64s)]
*  But I get involved in a bigger way when I feel like a man needs to say something to him. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8150.64s)]
*  Like when I see him, it's not about the schoolwork or they're not listening or whatever. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8155.64s)]
*  But when I see I come home, when he gets disrespectful to Jasmine or to our daughters, I don't say, don't you talk to her like that. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8160.64s)]
*  I say, what you've just done, buddy, is you've taken the easy way out. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8166.64s)]
*  It's much easier to yell back at your mom and your sisters. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8170.64s)]
*  It's much harder to say I'm a man and what I'm going to do is process what you said and walk away. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8173.64s)]
*  Or what I'm going to do and go fucking punch a wall. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8179.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's what it is. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8182.64s)]
*  Load those and keep pushing. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8183.64s)]
*  I always tell them don't take the easy way out. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8185.64s)]
*  You know, it's so easy to yell back at your mom and it's so easy to tell your sister she's an idiot. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8187.64s)]
*  That's that's the easy stuff. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8192.64s)]
*  The hard stuff is being is being is being a man. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8193.64s)]
*  How did you navigate the relationship with his dad? [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8196.64s)]
*  I am almost immediately from the beginning. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8200.64s)]
*  We're like because one of the benefits actually of Jasmine and I had our oldest daughter, Delilah, very quickly into the relationship. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8204.64s)]
*  Like we were only dating for a few months and she had conceived a baby. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8212.64s)]
*  So very quickly, that means her problems or her not problems, but her parts of her life became parts of my life. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8215.64s)]
*  And I have to kind of say to myself, again, we're having a child. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8221.64s)]
*  There are that you have you would have had kind of ways out of this if she wasn't pregnant. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8225.64s)]
*  But now you don't you have a child. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8230.64s)]
*  So this is your life now. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8232.64s)]
*  So choose peace as much as you can. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8233.64s)]
*  Every opportunity to choose peace. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8237.64s)]
*  So when father got introduced to me, Tristan's father got introduced to me, I immediately shook his hand and said, you know, I'm about to have a baby with Jasmine. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8238.64s)]
*  That's I look at you. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8248.64s)]
*  I look at this as the baby inside my my girlfriend is your son's brother or sister. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8250.64s)]
*  So we're connected here. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8257.64s)]
*  And I'm looking at this as the three of us as it takes a village. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8258.64s)]
*  We are there. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8261.64s)]
*  There are three parents. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8262.64s)]
*  I look at this as like a beautiful thing for our kids. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8263.64s)]
*  They have three parents. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8265.64s)]
*  They have like an extra hand. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8266.64s)]
*  So I don't want this to ever feel like this is your family. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8267.64s)]
*  This is mine. [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8270.64s)]
*  Let's all do this as one. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8271.64s)]
*  And I think from that we always have and we have a respectful relationship where it's like, you know, you're not going to be different. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8274.64s)]
*  There could be an opportunity to be best friends, but it's like when we see each other, it's cordial. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8279.64s)]
*  It's cool. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8284.64s)]
*  There is. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8285.64s)]
*  We also made an agreement. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8286.64s)]
*  Him and I each other said there will be no ever there will be no talking bad about each other in front of the kids. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8287.64s)]
*  Not about the mother of our children. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8294.64s)]
*  We will not do that. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8296.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8297.64s)]
*  And if we if if you know, we would say something to each other like you're speaking to remind you it's the mother of our kids here. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8298.64s)]
*  So like she needs to be sacred and held to a high standard. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8304.64s)]
*  So I think that for us, again, and that's a my that's from my father, though. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8307.64s)]
*  My father would always preach to me. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8312.64s)]
*  You got to do the harder thing. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8313.64s)]
*  What's the harder thing? [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8314.64s)]
*  Usually 99 percent of people are going to take the easy way. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8315.64s)]
*  You'll go with the easy thing. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8318.64s)]
*  It's very easy to, you know, pontificate online about, you know, like you were saying, nobody knows Iran and Israel. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8319.64s)]
*  And that's true because it's easy to just spout off shit that whatever you feel. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8325.64s)]
*  It's harder to do the research and actually take months and go to Tehran and see what the people are actually living. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8329.64s)]
*  Most people are going to do that. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8334.64s)]
*  So most people don't know. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8335.64s)]
*  So my dad would always preach that like be what is the harder thing? [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8336.64s)]
*  And I remember he told me and my stepmother told me because my my parents were divorced. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8340.64s)]
*  My stepmother told me, listen, when you when I met Jasmine said you're about to be a stepdad, you're going to be a dad in nine months. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8344.64s)]
*  But you're going to be a stepdad. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8351.64s)]
*  You're a stepdad right now. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8352.64s)]
*  It's the most thankless job in the world. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8353.64s)]
*  You have to give the same love and energy and the same support as a parent. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8355.64s)]
*  But you will most likely for a very long time not get any appreciation or respect for it. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8358.64s)]
*  And you have to override nature because you are not bonded to this child by nature. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8363.64s)]
*  And almost every other animal in the animal kingdom will kill that baby in the wild because it is not theirs. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8368.64s)]
*  So you have to override systems that are so deeply embedded in you that it's very difficult. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8374.64s)]
*  And what you have to do is just say this is the hard thing, but it's the right thing. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8378.64s)]
*  And you have to keep doing that over and over and over again. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8381.64s)]
*  So that's that's why that's why I do that. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8384.64s)]
*  Wow. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8386.64s)]
*  It's worked out though. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8387.64s)]
*  It's worked. [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8388.64s)]
*  Well, we're getting a divorce. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8389.64s)]
*  So far so good. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8391.64s)]
*  Now we're coming into some years. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8393.64s)]
*  My substance is about to be 15. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8394.64s)]
*  So there will be challenges of a teenager, of a teenage boy. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8395.64s)]
*  But I'm hoping that we just I'm just going to keep with that. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8399.64s)]
*  You know, that same principle I say do the hard thing. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8402.64s)]
*  The hard thing is usually the right thing. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8405.64s)]
*  And you know, you keep a loving relationship with them. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8407.64s)]
*  I mean, for me, it's like it's like again. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8409.64s)]
*  And even if I take it from a selfish point of view of I only care about my children. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8412.64s)]
*  Well, then you should care about that's their big brother. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8416.64s)]
*  Your children are going to be on those times when you're not around because your kids don't want to be with you. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8419.64s)]
*  They're going to be around their brother because they're similar in age. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8424.64s)]
*  And don't you want him respecting them and loving them being the big brother because then they'll be better girls. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8426.64s)]
*  So either way, whether you look at it selfishly or unselfishly, the answers love your stepson. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8430.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, 100 percent. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8435.64s)]
*  No, it's just a lot. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8437.64s)]
*  Yeah, God, I hope he kills me in a murder suicide. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8439.64s)]
*  That would be poetic play this at my funeral. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8443.64s)]
*  That would be on the Netflix doc. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8445.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's funny. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8446.64s)]
*  That would be wild. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8447.64s)]
*  Yeah, they go back and be like, wow, was he wrong about that? [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8448.64s)]
*  Yeah, you know what? [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8451.64s)]
*  The whole side was wrong. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8452.64s)]
*  I'm 16 and they were hanging flipped on him. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8454.64s)]
*  The FBI is actively investigating him right now because he has a list and I'm number one. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8456.64s)]
*  But here's the deal. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8461.64s)]
*  True crime is so popular of a genre. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8463.64s)]
*  Yeah, why do you think? [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8466.64s)]
*  We're going to run out of content. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8467.64s)]
*  We need content creators. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8468.64s)]
*  Someone's got to go do it. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8469.64s)]
*  I guarantee Mr. B starts killing people. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8470.64s)]
*  We got to keep up with this demand. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8472.64s)]
*  We're running out. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8475.64s)]
*  I mean, it's just running out. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8476.64s)]
*  Why is there this true crime obsession? [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8477.64s)]
*  Because we can get the thrill of what it is. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8479.64s)]
*  Without experiencing it. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8482.64s)]
*  To kill someone without experiencing it because everybody deep down wants to kill someone. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8483.64s)]
*  Because like I said, we're the most savage type of homo-safety. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8486.64s)]
*  It's mostly women that watch it. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8489.64s)]
*  Women are. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8491.64s)]
*  Yeah, I don't understand it at all. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8492.64s)]
*  Well, maybe that's just how much they hate other women is they like to watch them get murdered. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8493.64s)]
*  And they just watch and go, you stupid bitch. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8497.64s)]
*  You dumb bitch. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8501.64s)]
*  You don't marry a guy who owns a fucking boat. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8502.64s)]
*  You fucking dumb bitch. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8504.64s)]
*  You're going to end up dead on that fucking boat. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8505.64s)]
*  Dumb, stupid bitch. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8508.64s)]
*  Do your girls like true crime? [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8511.64s)]
*  Mine does not. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8513.64s)]
*  I don't. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8514.64s)]
*  No, my girl likes True Lies and Mormon Wives. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8515.64s)]
*  She's got good taste. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8518.64s)]
*  She likes like Frasier. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8519.64s)]
*  She watches reruns of Frasier. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8520.64s)]
*  Oh, no. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8521.64s)]
*  She's into like good shit. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8522.64s)]
*  Mine loves Housewives and shit. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8523.64s)]
*  My wife likes that too. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8524.64s)]
*  And they all love the Housewives. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8525.64s)]
*  They love the Housewives shit. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8526.64s)]
*  But yeah, we hope that they're watching it to laugh at them. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8527.64s)]
*  Right. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8532.64s)]
*  That's what we hope. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8533.64s)]
*  I think for them, it's like, we hope it's not inspiration. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8534.64s)]
*  They go like brain dead when they watch it. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8537.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8538.64s)]
*  They're just like, they just kind of like shit. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8539.64s)]
*  That's good. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8540.64s)]
*  Sometimes you need that to reset. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8541.64s)]
*  It's like meditating. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8542.64s)]
*  It's our sports, I think. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8543.64s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8544.64s)]
*  That's exactly it. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8545.64s)]
*  And they're all capable of like free agency gossip and all that. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8546.64s)]
*  That's what they do. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8547.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's what they do. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8548.64s)]
*  That's why they're watching Housewives. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8549.64s)]
*  I'm watching Brian Winhorst. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8550.64s)]
*  That's why the WNBA just has to admit. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8553.64s)]
*  Listen, women are never going to be into women's sports because their favorite sport is trying [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8557.64s)]
*  to destroy each other with fake compliments. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8562.64s)]
*  That's what they like. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8564.64s)]
*  So what you have to do is stop trying to get women to like it and get men to like it. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8565.64s)]
*  So no more lesbian dressing, everyone in fucking miniskirts. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8570.64s)]
*  Let's see some titties. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8573.64s)]
*  But what you're saying is happening. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8574.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8575.64s)]
*  Let's do it. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8576.64s)]
*  Like, first of all, this season or last season, they all just became hot. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8577.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8581.64s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8582.64s)]
*  There was no- [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8583.64s)]
*  Sophie Cunningham, Angel Reese, Kaylan Clark, they're all hot. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8584.64s)]
*  One of my favorite videos that I was just watching them walk into the arena. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8585.64s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8588.64s)]
*  I love watching it. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8589.64s)]
*  She looks good. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8590.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8591.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8592.64s)]
*  I watched it with a tub of acid next to me. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8593.64s)]
*  I got to admit, there's this account. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8594.64s)]
*  I mean, I don't know the guys. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8595.64s)]
*  Who's that girl that, Cedra or whatever, what's her name? [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8597.64s)]
*  Yachty was talking about her. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8602.64s)]
*  Beautiful. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8603.64s)]
*  Tamra Brink? [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8604.64s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8605.64s)]
*  I don't even think she's in the league anymore. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8606.64s)]
*  They should have kept her in though. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8607.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8608.64s)]
*  But there's this dude who, he's an Instagram guy and he does this Smash Olympic, like Smash [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8609.64s)]
*  playoffs of all the WNBA teams. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8615.64s)]
*  Smash or pass. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8618.64s)]
*  It's very funny. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8619.64s)]
*  And he goes through all of the teams and he's like, smash, pass respectfully. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8620.64s)]
*  And it's really fucking funny. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8624.64s)]
*  Have you seen the guys that do the, they're betting on Angel Reese missing her first shot. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8625.64s)]
*  She shoots like, yeah. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8632.039999999999s)]
*  But like they're up to 10 games and it's just four of them. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8633.039999999999s)]
*  They just watch the beginning of the game and they just wait for her to get the ball [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8635.64s)]
*  and then they go fucking crazy. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8639.64s)]
*  But it is true. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8641.84s)]
*  It's like once Kaylan came to the league, she started playing in a way that we wanted [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8642.84s)]
*  to play. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8647.24s)]
*  There's no guy that, I mean, outside of like NBA players that doesn't wish that they had [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8648.84s)]
*  Kaylan's game. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8652.24s)]
*  I want to be able to pull up from the fucking logo. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8653.24s)]
*  She could do it. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8654.24s)]
*  The second the game transfers to our interest point, we're invested. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8655.24s)]
*  We're watching. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8659.24s)]
*  So I think you're right. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8660.24s)]
*  It's like in order to get women's sports, in order for women's sports to be incredibly [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8661.24s)]
*  popular, you need to get the people who like sports to watch, which are men. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8665.24s)]
*  Which are men. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8669.24s)]
*  You're not going to transition all these women into girls that watch sports. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8670.24s)]
*  No, and it's the same principle. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8673.24s)]
*  Me and my girl got into a fight the other day because she was like, I was talking about [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8675.24s)]
*  the WNBA and I was watching it and I was like, you know, my daughter, my older daughter, [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8678.24s)]
*  I was like, oh, maybe she'll like it, whatever, because I can't really get her into sports. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8682.24s)]
*  It's like a thing. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8685.24s)]
*  I'm like trying so hard to get my older daughter into sports. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8686.24s)]
*  She just does not want to play and I don't know what to do. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8688.24s)]
*  So I'm trying to get her to watch and then Jazz is like, oh, please, you know you're [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8691.24s)]
*  only just watching because you think the girls are hot. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8695.24s)]
*  That's why you know Kaylan Clark's on the fever. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8697.24s)]
*  I was like, A, yes, but she's awesome. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8699.24s)]
*  But I was like, you what? [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8702.24s)]
*  You don't think it's the same for you? [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8703.24s)]
*  She's like, no, I watch sports because it's fun. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8704.24s)]
*  I'm like, really? [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8706.24s)]
*  Then how you're telling me you knew you knew Danny Amandola Stapps, some random guy from [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8707.24s)]
*  the Patriots. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8713.24s)]
*  You just wanted to have sex with him. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8714.24s)]
*  That's just what it is. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8716.24s)]
*  So it's the same principle. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8717.24s)]
*  And then she just wanted the other room to start cooking dinner. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8718.24s)]
*  I think Kaylan Clark, I think the long ball is kind of like the dunk to men. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8720.24s)]
*  Since women can't dunk like that, the long ball is like the dunk. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8724.24s)]
*  So now it's like. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8727.24s)]
*  And Steph opened that up. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8728.24s)]
*  Once the NBA transitioned into a three point shooting league, WNBA got popular. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8729.24s)]
*  So Steph really made women's basketball exciting. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8734.24s)]
*  Stephanie Curry. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8738.24s)]
*  She's gorgeous. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8740.24s)]
*  He would be the hottest player in the Phoenix Mercury. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8742.24s)]
*  I'm not saying there's anything wrong with lesbians. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8745.24s)]
*  Lesbians are great. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8748.24s)]
*  There's just not a lot of lesbians in the world. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8749.24s)]
*  So just from a marketing standpoint, it's just harder to market that. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8752.24s)]
*  No more cornrows and baggy clothes, girls. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8755.24s)]
*  Lesbians just pretend to be straight for fucking the marketing of it. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8758.24s)]
*  Just walking hot and then you can go eat pussy and do whatever you got to do. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8762.24s)]
*  But just be a girl on the walk in. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8766.24s)]
*  That's what we need. [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80A-_Pz3ZH8&t=8768.24s)]
