# Drake “Green Lights” Andrew Tate, Kanye is ULTIMATE Troll, & Toronto Arena Sold Out
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g)
*  What's up everybody welcome to Flay Grant today we got a boys episode listen Drake dropped an album [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=0.0s)]
*  Okay, also sold out two shows of scotia bank arena. What that's an amazing accomplishment [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6.32s)]
*  That is a lot of people man. Congrats to drake. Listen shout out to drake for something [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=12.48s)]
*  Let's go man, that was that's incredible. What an amazing thing that he did man. He should be very proud of himself [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=19.12s)]
*  Yeah, you know you gotta work can do that now they can't and you gotta work incredibly rarefied air [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=24.0s)]
*  Yeah, you he must have had a great team of support around him to achieve that must have an incredible fan base to really want to [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=27.92s)]
*  See him great openers probably also absolutely incredible [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=33.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's just a Drake thing obviously we're talking about Drake, yeah [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  So he absolutely killed that now the album comes out. I will say this he's been in the top of the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=45.92s)]
*  Music game for ten years. Okay ten years [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=52.0s)]
*  At least at least for the last five to seven he's got on lock. Yeah [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=54.72s)]
*  The pressure of putting out a project and every single time if it doesn't go number one, it's a failure. Yeah [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=61.68s)]
*  It's unbelievable and he drops a lot and he drops a lot. Yeah now [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=68.8s)]
*  Kendrick is dropping less and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=74.08s)]
*  He I think up up. It's a different approach to an album per se but he's dropping a lot [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=76.80000000000001s)]
*  And if it's not number one, it is a failure and everybody is chomping at the bit to say oh he fell off [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=82.56s)]
*  Oh, he's not what he used to be. Oh, it's not good enough, etc [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  while also innovating I think I [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  Understand why the criticism comes out because nobody can conceptualize what he's going through [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=95.64s)]
*  Nobody has empathy for his daughter and nobody can put themselves in that mind state of the pressure of having to be number one [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=100.44s)]
*  Amazing phenomenal every single time or your failure and appeasing such a wide base of fans now [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=107.8s)]
*  Yeah, so mainstream now [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  it's so I think the knee-jerk reaction to any time the person who's on top puts out a project is to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=114.89999999999999s)]
*  Find the things that you don't like in it and I think we've seen a lot of that, right? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=120.56s)]
*  The person who's on the way up you're finding everything about it that you see promising. Why are they the goat? Yeah [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=125.72s)]
*  He's next. This is the thing. This is why he's so good [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=132.04s)]
*  Look at his flow on that you're looking at you're looking at the few good songs on that up-and-comers album and not looking at any [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=134.76000000000002s)]
*  Of the misses when you're at the top if there's two misses you're going man, but those are whack [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=140.76000000000002s)]
*  What's going on was that you know, so I think I wonder if [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=147.56s)]
*  He's aware of this and going back and forth of people online [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=153.24s)]
*  Simply as a marketing tool because I don't see him going back and forth online if he's not dropping [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=157.24s)]
*  But now that he's dropping he's back and forth with everybody [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=161.45999999999998s)]
*  so I wonder if he's doing it as a marketing tool or if he's going through the insane vulnerability of [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=164.11999999999998s)]
*  Putting out a finished product and then you just have to wait for the reaction music ain't comedy [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  Comedy we go up and we workshop jokes. We know if a joke ain't working or it is. Yeah by the time we drop our special [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=176.89999999999998s)]
*  We're aware of it. Yeah music is I think I know how to make this music and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=182.29999999999998s)]
*  I finished making it and I'm putting it out and fucking fingers crossed. Yeah, that's crazy, dude [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=187.86s)]
*  So crazy, so this part of me it goes. Okay. He's just going back and forth for marketing and then there's another part of me [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=193.86s)]
*  It's just like nah, this is fucking vulnerable as hell. Mm-hmm, but we've never seen that from him before going back and forth [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=198.5s)]
*  Yeah, nah that he's when he's calculated in the comments. He's he's I mean he's going [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=204.44s)]
*  ham on it now like [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=210.9s)]
*  He like [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=212.94s)]
*  Drake is in the comments on this blog from Toronto keep six solid [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=225.5s)]
*  I think it's called and he goes he goes a green light [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=229.34s)]
*  With a smiley face, but also green light. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Mm-hmm [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=233.3s)]
*  Yeah [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=238.34s)]
*  You don't think is happening [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=240.22s)]
*  I don't know. I don't think it's happening. But what about the people that do that kind of behavior for him? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=242.74s)]
*  I mean, he's got to have protection to be in the rap game [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=247.9s)]
*  What's your point if it's calculated Texas boy, you don't believe in Jake Prince [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=250.98s)]
*  I do but I don't think he is gonna publicly say green light and then it's a green light [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=254.36s)]
*  No, I mean, no, but all of his super fans or people who want to get in good with him [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=259.5s)]
*  I could see them easily being like oh shit. He put that message out there [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=264.8s)]
*  Let's try to get in here now. I curry favor from from Drake by handling business. Yeah [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=269.34s)]
*  Yeah, that's usually how it works. Yeah, the head dude doesn't have to like call you up and say yo get get, you know finish that guy [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=275.06s)]
*  Mm-hmm. He just goes man. This guy's a real inconvenience. Yeah. Yeah, just this guy's real frustrating [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=281.58s)]
*  Yeah, it would be a shame if anything happened to him, but you got to get out to him [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=287.14s)]
*  Like where's Andrew Tate? He's still in Romania. I think so on house arrest if I'm not mistaken [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=290.7s)]
*  You can get a Romanian but like Drake could get a Roman go in a Romania [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=294.65999999999997s)]
*  Romanians he just needs one bar. I mean he got the Czechoslovakians and the Yugoslavians [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=298.82s)]
*  He gave him one bar and I see him posting like crazy [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=304.82s)]
*  Don't even exist no more [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=309.61999999999995s)]
*  Every country that used to be part of Yugoslavia is charged to fuck up. Yeah, you know those boys don't play around [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=312.38s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's who he hires to take out tape bro if Drake kills Andrew Tate [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=317.78s)]
*  Yo [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=325.5s)]
*  He's back to being a feminist hero [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=328.9s)]
*  For all the dogs for all the bitches [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=335.02s)]
*  Whoa [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=339.21999999999997s)]
*  What a crazy [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=340.21999999999997s)]
*  Do you finally put some respect on? Oh, I'm loving this Drake. I've always said I look he's probably the greatest rapper ever [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=342.02s)]
*  He's just not for me because I'm a fucking virgin. Yeah, who didn't try to go out there and fuck everybody [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=348.41999999999996s)]
*  Oh, but this guy I just don't relate to the music [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=353.02s)]
*  I can't live through it, but I can live through a billionaire who's like who wants the smoke? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=355.42s)]
*  I'm gonna fuck all of you in the comment. I don't go fuck I'm gonna go on this [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=359.34s)]
*  Okay, so you like the some people call it petty you like I'm petty and this guy's a billionaire is still petty [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=370.34s)]
*  I love that. Hmm. Now. Do you think it's calculated? Do you think it's I do think it's I think he knows [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=377.86s)]
*  It's good promo. So it is a little calculated. He's like I want to say it fuck them and also it's good promo [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=384.22s)]
*  So he justifies the emotion of wanting to say it. There's nothing holding him back now [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=390.06s)]
*  He's like fuck fuck. Who the fuck is this podcast are talking shit about me? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=393.82s)]
*  Yeah, I'm gonna fuck I want to leave a comment and then the logical side. It's like, you know, that guy might not be worth it [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=397.1s)]
*  He's like, you know, fuck dad. This is actually promo for me. So let's win win [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=401.38s)]
*  Oh, yeah, let me say whatever I want to say dance dance dance [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=405.56s)]
*  Yeah [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=408.7s)]
*  The time like shake shit up cause the controversy and to your point man when you're on top for a decade plus it's like [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=408.98s)]
*  Everybody's gonna have something to say. Yeah, I think one thing he has though is I realized Drake fans are male Swifties male [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=415.58s)]
*  Beehive, whatever like when you're a Drake stand you ride for that motherfucker so hard [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=422.14s)]
*  Yeah, and that's another incentive to talk shit to people because my fans are gonna put a battery in my back [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=427.26s)]
*  Yo is is it's hard boy is Drake like the male Kim Kardashian and I say that in terms of no [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=431.82s)]
*  No, hold on now. Hold on now. He got some hips on [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=438.42s)]
*  No, I'm waiting on that too great. Hold on one second [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=443.94s)]
*  and I said in terms of [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=447.54s)]
*  Kim is probably the [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=449.34000000000003s)]
*  Greatest influencer in history to women right literally has changed the way like women's faces look around the world [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=451.34000000000003s)]
*  Right change the way their bodies have looked like there are all [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=457.5s)]
*  Emulating her you can go to any country in the world and there are women that kind of look like [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=461.82s)]
*  Kim yeah, right change the way women use makeup everything [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=466.21999999999997s)]
*  Drake has an aesthetic that guys are copying. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you see guys that are [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=470.14s)]
*  What [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=478.26s)]
*  What aesthetic [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=479.58s)]
*  You don't think guys are trying to look like Drake [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=481.22s)]
*  No, I feel like everybody clowns him and they say he can't dress and not clothing like what haircut [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=483.5s)]
*  Haircut beard, oh, maybe I just have noticed it. I'm honestly I swear to God. I'm not even capping [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=490.74s)]
*  Can you look at Al's face right now? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=495.66s)]
*  Glasses and his beard trying to look as much as he can like drink. I mean just having a beard. Yeah, it's more cool [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=498.7s)]
*  Nails [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=505.74s)]
*  You try to look like nice do we do you try to be great? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=507.74s)]
*  I think I did first. Okay, you try to be trade bro. Well, tell me what you thought of the album from your boy [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=511.26s)]
*  So I was dressed like this right now [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=517.5s)]
*  You've been trying to be Drake for the last three years out that you went to Burning Man once that's [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=522.42s)]
*  Okay, and then you try to turn into motherfucking Drake that is Drake [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=530.7s)]
*  So, okay, maybe I'll just agrees but I do think you could say that he has had a [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=540.42s)]
*  Physical influence on the way people look like I think people are trying to kind of emulate the Drake look [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=545.4599999999999s)]

*  Like getting married, no? [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=1983.24s)]
*  No, but also [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=1985.24s)]
*  with all due respect. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=1987.24s)]
*  Is that with respect or not? [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=1989.24s)]
*  With all due respect, would they be okay with a mashada boom boom? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=1991.24s)]
*  With all due respect. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=1993.24s)]
*  Just with all due respect. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=1995.24s)]
*  I have to say with all due respect. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=1997.24s)]
*  No, they don't want anyone to have [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=1999.24s)]
*  sex before marriage. That makes sense. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2001.24s)]
*  But after marriage, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2003.24s)]
*  then what? With all due respect. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2005.24s)]
*  Because marriage is [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2007.24s)]
*  with all due respect. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2009.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. It's totally due. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2011.24s)]
*  Okay, alright. Well listen, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2013.24s)]
*  we had some fun while we were in Toronto. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2015.24s)]
*  Outside of just that, there was [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2017.24s)]
*  a little bit of celebration that involved some Mali. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2019.24s)]
*  Did involve it. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2021.24s)]
*  Okay? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2023.24s)]
*  And [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2025.24s)]
*  before the Mali, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2027.24s)]
*  we were having some fun at the shows. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2029.24s)]
*  This is what I want to hear about. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2031.24s)]
*  Miles has a funny story. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2033.24s)]
*  So we're doing the shows obviously at Scotiabank [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2035.24s)]
*  where the Raptors play, and we were [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2037.24s)]
*  in the Raptors' locker room. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2039.24s)]
*  Usually you get the visitors' locker room. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2041.24s)]
*  But we were in the Raptors' locker room. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2043.24s)]
*  And keep in mind, the season starts this week. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2045.24s)]
*  So they all got their sneakers in there. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2047.24s)]
*  They had their stuff. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2049.24s)]
*  So Miles, can you tell the story about [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2051.24s)]
*  you know what I'm talking about? [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2053.24s)]
*  Which one? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2055.24s)]
*  When the Raptors are trying to get into the locker room? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2057.24s)]
*  Oh, bro. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2059.24s)]
*  There's two giant [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2061.24s)]
*  dudes trying to get into the locker room. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2063.24s)]
*  They're a locker room. Their names [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2065.24s)]
*  are on the wall. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2067.24s)]
*  And they have to come up to me and be like, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2069.24s)]
*  another security guard comes up to me and he's like, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2071.24s)]
*  hey, we just want to get the Raptors [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2073.24s)]
*  back in their locker room. We're wondering if that's [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2075.24s)]
*  okay with you. And I was like, it's theirs, dude. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2077.24s)]
*  It's their thing. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2079.24s)]
*  And then the president of the Raptors wanted [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2081.24s)]
*  to get in. And they also had to ask [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2083.24s)]
*  our team if he could use certain [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2085.24s)]
*  doors. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2087.24s)]
*  That's so cool. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2089.24s)]
*  Dude, you run Toronto. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2091.24s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2093.24s)]
*  But I just thought that's hysterical. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2095.24s)]
*  This is your place of work. Your name [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2097.24s)]
*  is on the fucking lockers. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2099.24s)]
*  And you want to go in and then someone stops you. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2101.24s)]
*  And they're like, not someone, Miles. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2103.24s)]
*  Miles is doing security. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2105.24s)]
*  You're like a subleasee for the night and they got to ask, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2107.24s)]
*  can I just go to my place real quick? My closet. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2109.24s)]
*  I left something in there. They did Airbnb the place. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2111.24s)]
*  And they just needed to grab something. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2113.24s)]
*  It's kind of annoying. It'd be like if this studio became like a [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2115.24s)]
*  basketball court for like one weekend [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2117.24s)]
*  out of the year. And then we had to come and be like, oh, they're playing basketball. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2119.24s)]
*  Sorry guys. Yeah, we should have grabbed a microphone. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2121.24s)]
*  Yeah, fuck. It is crazy. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2123.24s)]
*  Any wild stories for you guys [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2125.24s)]
*  from Toronto? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2127.24s)]
*  I thought Dove fell in love. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2129.24s)]
*  Bro, Dove is there [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2131.24s)]
*  with this beautiful [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2133.24s)]
*  woman. Beautiful woman. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2135.24s)]
*  At one point, she's sitting on his [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2137.24s)]
*  lap. Wait, which one? [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2139.24s)]
*  Damn, love was in the air, huh? [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2141.24s)]
*  At one point, she's sitting on his lap. He's like caressing his [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2143.24s)]
*  shoulder. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2145.24s)]
*  I'm like, I'm asking her, I'm like, is that girl [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2147.24s)]
*  Jewish? And then everybody's like, oh yeah. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2149.24s)]
*  Yeah, she's Jewish. She's Jewish. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2151.24s)]
*  And I'm like, where the hell is she from? And then [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2153.24s)]
*  someone's like, I actually think she's even [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2155.24s)]
*  Moroccan. I'm like, this is like perfect. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2157.24s)]
*  Perfect, right? And [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2159.24s)]
*  it was his cousin. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2163.24s)]
*  So we actually went a little too close. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2165.24s)]
*  But they were, they were caressing and loving. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2170.24s)]
*  And there was just this beautiful, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2174.24s)]
*  familial experience that we were witnessing. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2176.24s)]
*  Maybe that's what Dove needs. That's also true. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2179.24s)]
*  That's what I told Dove. Love is close for him, bro. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2181.24s)]
*  It's under his nose. It's right there. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2183.24s)]
*  I didn't have to be close to be under his nose. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2185.24s)]
*  It could be anywhere. Also, good point. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2187.24s)]
*  The point that I'm trying to make here is that [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2189.24s)]
*  we were sitting at this bar watching this. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2191.24s)]
*  We were sitting at this bar watching [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2193.24s)]
*  this. And Mark [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2195.24s)]
*  goes, I say something [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2197.24s)]
*  to Mark, and he goes, I'm sorry, I'm a little distracted. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2199.24s)]
*  I'm like, why? He goes, I'm just watching Dove about [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2201.24s)]
*  to fuck his cousin. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2203.24s)]
*  It's hard to talk about anything else. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2205.24s)]
*  It's really difficult. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2207.24s)]
*  We're at a pizza place later that night. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2209.24s)]
*  We bring it up. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2211.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2213.24s)]
*  Okay. Mark set this up. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2215.24s)]
*  We bring it up. Yeah. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2217.24s)]
*  And basically we're just like, oh yeah, Dove, what's the situation with your cousin? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2219.24s)]
*  She was sitting on your lap and he was being respectful. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2221.24s)]
*  He didn't put his hand on her waist. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2223.24s)]
*  Oh, do you have the picture? [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2225.24s)]
*  He just tucked his hand beside him. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2227.24s)]
*  So she's sitting on the lap, but he realized it's a little too far to like caress the hips. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2229.24s)]
*  So his hand is just broke [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2233.24s)]
*  wristed like that, hanging off the side of the chair. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2235.24s)]
*  So he doesn't do what his body is telling him to do, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2237.24s)]
*  which is wrap her up and secure and protect her. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2239.24s)]
*  And then procreate. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2241.24s)]
*  I thought you guys were joking that that was his cousin. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2243.24s)]
*  No! I swear to God. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2245.24s)]
*  This is why you white people are weird. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2247.24s)]
*  We visit each other twice a year. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2249.24s)]
*  Okay, you don't understand what... [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2251.24s)]
*  Hey, hey, hey, uh-uh-uh. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2253.24s)]
*  I promise. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2255.24s)]
*  Can I just say one thing? [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2257.24s)]
*  This is all I'm trying to say here is, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2259.24s)]
*  as long as I've known Duff, I've said that his family members have an uncanny resemblance. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2261.24s)]
*  I can spot... [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2267.24s)]
*  I can spot... [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2269.24s)]
*  I'm not even touching it. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2271.24s)]
*  Hold on a second. I can spot a man from a mile away. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2273.24s)]
*  And you can smell him from two. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2275.24s)]
*  Two, easily. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2277.24s)]
*  I can spot from a mile away. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2279.24s)]
*  Okay? And I've always joked to them, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2281.24s)]
*  I was like, that's because there was probably a more concentrated gene pool, right? [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2283.24s)]
*  You're from the fucking Atlas Mountains and stuff like that. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2285.24s)]
*  I joke around... This is jokes. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2287.24s)]
*  We're all joking. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2289.24s)]
*  When I saw that... [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2291.24s)]
*  Yo, Duff. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2293.24s)]
*  Look at that hand. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2295.24s)]
*  That hand is limped down. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2297.24s)]
*  But what does it want? [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2299.24s)]
*  Nothing. I officiated her wedding. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2301.24s)]
*  This is my cousin. She's a mom. She's wonderful. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2303.24s)]
*  She's beautiful. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2305.24s)]
*  I can't be as close as I can. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2307.24s)]
*  Does anyone object? [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2309.24s)]
*  Okay, so... [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2311.24s)]
*  We were just goofing and we were like, [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2313.24s)]
*  yeah, isn't that a little wild? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2315.24s)]
*  So Mark goes, you wouldn't let your sister sit on your lap. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2317.24s)]
*  And then Duff goes, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2319.24s)]
*  he goes, oh, hell no. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2321.24s)]
*  And then Duff and Tanya, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2323.24s)]
*  at the exact same time, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2325.24s)]
*  go, it's different than a cousin. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2327.24s)]
*  And Mark and I just go, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2333.24s)]
*  what the fuck? [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2335.24s)]
*  Not today. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2337.24s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2339.24s)]
*  Bro, bro, bro. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2341.24s)]
*  We go, what do you mean it's different than your cousin? [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2343.24s)]
*  And he goes, it's just different. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2345.24s)]
*  Like, you can sit on your cousin's lap. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2347.24s)]
*  Yeah, I got a female cousin [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2349.24s)]
*  I'm very close to, we're not sitting on each other's lap. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2351.24s)]
*  What about sitting on her mouth? [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2353.24s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2355.24s)]
*  With all due respect, say it. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2357.24s)]
*  With all due respect! [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2359.24s)]
*  That was late! [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2361.24s)]
*  With all due respect, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2363.24s)]
*  would you let her put that pound cake on you? [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2365.24s)]
*  No, no chance. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2367.24s)]
*  Duff would, I would not. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2369.24s)]
*  Would you sleep with your cousin? [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2371.24s)]
*  Is this slow news day? [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2373.24s)]
*  Any of you guys want to talk about it? [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2375.24s)]
*  No, but I need some equity. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2377.24s)]
*  Don't act like you're better than this. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2379.24s)]
*  You tried to bang at a family reunion. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2381.24s)]
*  Nah, but that's three cousins away. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2383.24s)]
*  That's different. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2385.24s)]
*  I'm with that. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2387.24s)]
*  Hold on, I forgot, Al did try to have sex with one of his cousins. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2389.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2391.24s)]
*  It's like barely. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2393.24s)]
*  There you go. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2395.24s)]
*  Take us through it. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2397.24s)]
*  It might have been three away, but if it was two, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2399.24s)]
*  she was bad enough. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2401.24s)]
*  You shoot it, right? [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2403.24s)]
*  Now, now, now. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2405.24s)]
*  But that, if it's one, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2407.24s)]
*  if it's one away, first cousin. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2409.24s)]
*  She's Rihanna, but she's your cousin. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2411.24s)]
*  With all due respect. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2413.24s)]
*  With all due respect, you would rearrange your cousin's guts. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2415.24s)]
*  Nah, it's too close. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2417.24s)]
*  We don't have a bunch of re-rees popping out like [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2419.24s)]
*  we don't need that. We have one Rihanna already. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2421.24s)]
*  I think cousins get away with it. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2423.24s)]
*  I don't think genetically it makes it that bad. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2425.24s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2427.24s)]
*  It's too close. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2429.24s)]
*  We just saw this stunningly beautiful woman [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2431.24s)]
*  sitting on your lap. None of us knew it was your cousin. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2433.24s)]
*  I had a suspicion. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2435.24s)]
*  You've met my cousin before. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2437.24s)]
*  No, your cousin's beautiful. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2439.24s)]
*  I understand why. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2441.24s)]
*  This whole family is stunning. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2443.24s)]
*  They're gorgeous. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2445.24s)]
*  With all due respect, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2447.24s)]
*  imagine you're from this [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2449.24s)]
*  small little community in the Atlas Mountains [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2451.24s)]
*  and everywhere else you go, people are uglier. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2453.24s)]
*  Gross. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2455.24s)]
*  You're the most beautiful people. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2457.24s)]
*  Objectively. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2459.24s)]
*  Can we just make the whole argument? [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2461.24s)]
*  If we're living in Bedwin tents, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2463.24s)]
*  don't you want to sit on a lap instead of on the ground? [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2465.24s)]
*  That's the argument. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2467.24s)]
*  I want to leave it at that one. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2469.24s)]
*  This is not genetics. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2471.24s)]
*  He's got to make it genetic. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2473.24s)]
*  It was the tents. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2475.24s)]
*  It was the tents that got him. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2477.24s)]
*  It was the tents because your hard dick [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2479.24s)]
*  is way more comfortable. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2481.24s)]
*  You were pitching a tent. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2483.24s)]
*  You were pitching a tent, actually. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2485.24s)]
*  I think you bring up a good point, which is [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2487.24s)]
*  obviously laying on each other is going to be a little more comfortable. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2489.24s)]
*  But you also have to understand [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2491.24s)]
*  your family is so unbelievably [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2493.24s)]
*  attractive. It's insane [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2495.24s)]
*  how stunningly beautiful every [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2497.24s)]
*  person in your family is. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2499.24s)]
*  Why would you want to fuck people outside your family? [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2501.24s)]
*  We don't. That's why. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2503.24s)]
*  We don't want to. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2505.24s)]
*  They all go through the white Jews. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2507.24s)]
*  How do you walk in and out? [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2509.24s)]
*  We make the Russians and the Moroccans. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2511.24s)]
*  I told you this for years. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2513.24s)]
*  It's khetsi-khetsi. It doesn't work. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2515.24s)]
*  I don't think you heard what you said. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2517.24s)]
*  Oh, I do. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2519.24s)]
*  It doesn't matter. I was already spinning. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2521.24s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2525.24s)]
*  Wait, but then, so if it's nothing [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2527.24s)]
*  sexual, then why can't your sister [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2529.24s)]
*  sit on your lap? It's not a sister [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2531.24s)]
*  thing. It would be, but my sisters and I have always just [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2533.24s)]
*  like, just like, we [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2535.24s)]
*  barely hug each other, but we hug each other now. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2537.24s)]
*  We're very close. How close? It's just how we grew up. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2539.24s)]
*  Lap to lap. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2541.24s)]
*  Mark, you want to talk about you and your sisters? [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2543.24s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2545.24s)]
*  He wasn't in the room, but this is... [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2547.24s)]
*  It wasn't me. I wasn't trying to [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2549.24s)]
*  want to tell my sister. I wasn't trying to [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2551.24s)]
*  bang my fam's fam. With all due respect, though. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2553.24s)]
*  With all due respect. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2555.24s)]
*  I once, in Miami, I walked [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2557.24s)]
*  in and everyone, they were in their [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2559.24s)]
*  underwear, and Mark was just around hanging [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2561.24s)]
*  and not saying anything, just talking. Normally. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2563.24s)]
*  I went upstairs. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2565.24s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2567.24s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2569.24s)]
*  He's really fighting back. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2571.24s)]
*  He's really fighting back. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2573.24s)]
*  We need to call him up. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2575.24s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2577.24s)]
*  I walked in and I was just like, barely [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2579.24s)]
*  covered up. Everyone was there. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2581.24s)]
*  Dove starts taking off his clothes too. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2583.24s)]
*  He's like, it's alright. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2585.24s)]
*  Was Mark naked? I didn't know those were Florida [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2587.24s)]
*  things. Inviting his cousin over. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2589.24s)]
*  What happened? [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2591.24s)]
*  With all due respect, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2593.24s)]
*  Mark, you get a little wet. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2595.24s)]
*  I've never seen anyone [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2597.24s)]
*  spin out of the spin like this ever. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2599.24s)]
*  That was good. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2601.24s)]
*  We literally had [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2603.24s)]
*  cousins, we had cousins fucking locked on Dove. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2605.24s)]
*  And somehow he switched [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2607.24s)]
*  into this. He kissed his cousin. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2609.24s)]
*  He turned him back. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2611.24s)]
*  It's too desperate. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2613.24s)]
*  But Miles is here just crying like, [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2615.24s)]
*  why was I? [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2617.24s)]
*  They're close. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2619.24s)]
*  I'm close to my cousins, you're close to your [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2621.24s)]
*  sisters. I get it. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2623.24s)]
*  Wait, can you explain what was going on? [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2625.24s)]
*  I truly don't know what you're talking [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2627.24s)]
*  about. Are you talking about us at the pool? [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2629.24s)]
*  No. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2631.24s)]
*  Where was he? [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2633.24s)]
*  Look at him. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2635.24s)]
*  I don't know if he's telling the truth or not, but [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2637.24s)]
*  it's really compelling. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2639.24s)]
*  I don't want to embarrass him too much. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2641.24s)]
*  It was wild though. You can share all the details. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2643.24s)]
*  Let's go. Floor's yours. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2645.24s)]
*  Your sisters were in bra and underwear. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2647.24s)]
*  Upstairs in your apartment you weren't saying anything. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2649.24s)]
*  Was I there? [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2651.24s)]
*  You were there? The cat was there? [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2653.24s)]
*  What was the cat word? [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2655.24s)]
*  The cat was looking away. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2657.24s)]
*  No. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2659.24s)]
*  No! [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2669.24s)]
*  Dove, you can't carpet behind Mark [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2671.24s)]
*  like that. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2673.24s)]
*  Get back here! [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2675.24s)]
*  Oh shit. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2677.24s)]
*  Wow. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2679.24s)]
*  Can you explain what the hell is going on? [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2681.24s)]
*  I don't know what he's talking about. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2683.24s)]
*  You're just going to straight cat right now? [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2685.24s)]
*  Somebody just straight lied. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2687.24s)]
*  My family is insinuating. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2689.24s)]
*  Who do you think is lying? The guy that fucks his cousin? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2691.24s)]
*  Trying to get out of his spin cycle? [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2693.24s)]
*  As red as you were, son. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2695.24s)]
*  I thought he was going to say something crazy. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2697.24s)]
*  I didn't know what he was talking about. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2699.24s)]
*  He did say something crazy. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2701.24s)]
*  The fact that you don't think he said anything crazy [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2703.24s)]
*  makes me know you did that. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2705.24s)]
*  You think that's normal. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2707.24s)]
*  No. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2709.24s)]
*  It's not a real story. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2711.24s)]
*  Mark, no! [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2719.24s)]
*  Mark, no! [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2721.24s)]
*  Mark, we got to get you out of this. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2723.24s)]
*  Mark, with all due respect, tell us about the seance. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2725.24s)]
*  What was happening? [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2727.24s)]
*  Just explain what was happening, Mark. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2729.24s)]
*  What was going on? [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2731.24s)]
*  What is happening? [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2733.24s)]
*  How do you get out of a lie? [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2735.24s)]
*  He left. He walked away. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2737.24s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2745.24s)]
*  Just explain what he might be describing. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2747.24s)]
*  Is it possible you all came back from the pool? [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2749.24s)]
*  I'm assuming we all went to the pool [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2751.24s)]
*  and then he's scandalized by women having rights [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2753.24s)]
*  and then when he saw women in a bikini [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2755.24s)]
*  he was like, oh my god. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2757.24s)]
*  He's gay. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2759.24s)]
*  He empowers women the most. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2761.24s)]
*  Duff? [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2763.24s)]
*  Duff? [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2765.24s)]
*  I don't know if he empowers women the most. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2767.24s)]
*  Come on, using them as comrades? [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2769.24s)]
*  I don't know if that's empowering. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2771.24s)]
*  I don't think fuck-shitting-fucking-empowering. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2773.24s)]
*  Jesus Christ! [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2775.24s)]
*  What the hell? [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2777.24s)]
*  It's not building a strong case. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2779.24s)]
*  Does he have a defense? [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2781.24s)]
*  Oh my god, Mark! [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2783.24s)]
*  This is insanity! [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2785.24s)]
*  Jesus, Mark! [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2787.24s)]
*  Fucking savage! [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2789.24s)]
*  I want no beef with this. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2791.24s)]
*  You guys be shooting. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2793.24s)]
*  The way you guys react [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2795.24s)]
*  makes it seem like it's true. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2797.24s)]
*  I was just joking. You guys are crazy. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2799.24s)]
*  Wait, didn't it? [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2801.24s)]
*  I don't know why you guys reacted like that. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2803.24s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2805.24s)]
*  So we just... [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2807.24s)]
*  And we're back. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2809.24s)]
*  What do you mean we're back? [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2811.24s)]
*  We've bleeped a few, but we're still in. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2813.24s)]
*  We're definitely still in. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2815.24s)]
*  So you think Duff just saw you guys all waking up [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2817.24s)]
*  and it just so happened you were in the room together [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2821.24s)]
*  eating Cheerios or something like that, right? [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2823.24s)]
*  There's not like... [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2825.24s)]
*  I mean, with all due respect... [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2827.24s)]
*  With all due respect. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2829.24s)]
*  With all due respect, that's probably what he saw. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2831.24s)]
*  Yeah, probably. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2833.24s)]
*  I don't think this game is We Run Your Siblings in a Bandy Show. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2835.24s)]
*  I don't know why this is the topic. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2837.24s)]
*  I like how you tried to stretch it to Bandy Show. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2839.24s)]
*  We know underwear bands. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2841.24s)]
*  Dude, I'm a dude of a thing. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2843.24s)]
*  I agree. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2845.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2847.24s)]
*  I've never seen much of it. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2849.24s)]
*  I know, I know what it is. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2851.24s)]
*  I'm trying to shoot Duff in his fucking flannel. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2853.24s)]
*  I'm trying to think how to get him to have a lie. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2855.24s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2857.24s)]
*  Oh, I got you. You're calculating. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2859.24s)]
*  So sometimes you beat it with a bigger lie, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2861.24s)]
*  which is what you went for. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2863.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2865.24s)]
*  That was just so wildly specific. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2867.24s)]
*  You lean in. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2869.24s)]
*  It wasn't even salacious. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2871.24s)]
*  It was just like, there was some weird shit I said that came to myself. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2873.24s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with being... [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2875.24s)]
*  Your sisters are staying with you? [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2877.24s)]
*  Of course you're going to be in underwear at one point in time. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2879.24s)]
*  They're staying with you? [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2881.24s)]
*  Not going to sleep in jeans? [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2883.24s)]
*  I don't know if I was in the room for that if they were in underwear. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2885.24s)]
*  Duff might have been. Duff was creeping around the apartment a lot. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2887.24s)]
*  Whenever my pay the card, he would be around and be lurking. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2889.24s)]
*  So maybe the girls were all in underwear together. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2893.24s)]
*  Yeah, and then Duff might have been in the window. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2895.24s)]
*  Or maybe in the door. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2897.24s)]
*  I don't know where he was. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2899.24s)]
*  And if you were there, would they all be dressed in that way? [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2901.24s)]
*  So that's totally cool. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2903.24s)]
*  No, no. They would not have been in underwear necessarily. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2905.24s)]
*  What is happening? [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2907.24s)]
*  He's trying to help me. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2909.24s)]
*  I'm saying nothing. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2911.24s)]

*  I can't believe Dove never brought this up until now. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2963.24s)]
*  He was waiting. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2965.24s)]
*  He had it just in the top. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=2967.24s)]

*  We're fucking cousins. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3095.24s)]
*  That is how you handle it. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3097.24s)]
*  That is killing it right now. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3099.24s)]
*  You should have said slumber party. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3101.24s)]

*  Taylor Swift jet conspiracy [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3167.24s)]
*  that she got. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3169.24s)]
*  Come back, though. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3171.24s)]
*  Oh, [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3173.24s)]
*  man. I ain't gonna lie. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3175.24s)]
*  This bitch, the Taylor Swift jet conspiracy [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3177.24s)]
*  is absolutely fantastic. This girl [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3179.24s)]
*  on TikTok, I saw her do it. Did you hear about this? [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3181.24s)]
*  I didn't hear about it either. This is fire. So you know she was [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3183.24s)]
*  at the jet game, right? Yeah. And you know the big knock on Taylor Swift is she [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3185.24s)]
*  fronts like she's this environmentalist, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3187.24s)]
*  but she got this private jet that flies around [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3189.24s)]
*  more than anything else, so she's polluting the environment [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3191.24s)]
*  more than anything. So if you type in [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3193.24s)]
*  Taylor Swift jet, it talks about [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3195.24s)]
*  how her private jet [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3197.24s)]
*  is polluting the earth and how she's a fake [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3199.24s)]
*  environmentalist. Now, if you Google [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3201.24s)]
*  Taylor Swift jet, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3203.24s)]
*  she was at the Jets game. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3205.24s)]
*  Now, she can't just go to the Jets game, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3207.24s)]
*  because then people are gonna know what's up. So she'll go to the game [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3209.24s)]
*  before, and then the Jets [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3211.24s)]
*  game. If she never goes to another one, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3213.24s)]
*  I think we know how [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3215.24s)]
*  she used Travis Kelce. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3217.24s)]
*  Yo, that's like... Lowkey? [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3219.24s)]
*  Yeah. The goat. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3221.24s)]
*  Yeah. The goat. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3223.24s)]
*  I gave it to her. That's the Disney thing with Frozen. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3225.24s)]
*  No. Apparently, like, if you [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3227.24s)]
*  search Disney Frozen... Oh, he [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3229.24s)]
*  froze his fucking... Disney being cryogenically [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3231.24s)]
*  frozen, and then people are like, they made this [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3233.24s)]
*  movie and they called it Frozen, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3235.24s)]
*  because that way if you Google Disney Frozen, [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3237.24s)]
*  it shows up with the movie. And [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3239.24s)]
*  was he actually cryogenically frozen? [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3241.24s)]
*  No one knows. I don't know if that's confirmed. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3243.24s)]
*  Because you would have to do that while you're still alive. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3245.24s)]
*  In order to be... Yeah, like, right when you die. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3247.24s)]
*  But Ted Williams wasn't... [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3249.24s)]
*  Ted Williams was [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3251.24s)]
*  still alive when he was frozen? [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3253.24s)]
*  I didn't know he was frozen. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3255.24s)]
*  I don't know if he was still alive or not. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3257.24s)]
*  There was a big battle between us. Two seconds ago, you said. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3259.24s)]
*  He was frozen. He was frozen. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3261.24s)]
*  He didn't even say the words [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3263.24s)]
*  while he was alive. But he wanted to be frozen after he [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3265.24s)]
*  died? There's no point in that. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3267.24s)]
*  Now you're just an asshole. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3269.24s)]
*  Not you and Ted Williams. But what if they could bring you back [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3271.24s)]
*  after you die still? Like with your tissue or something? [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3273.24s)]
*  Hmm. Well, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3275.24s)]
*  yeah, I guess that makes sense. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3277.24s)]
*  I guess I would assume [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3279.24s)]
*  it's like... You ever do that thing with a [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3281.24s)]
*  bumblebee? You can freeze [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3283.24s)]
*  it, tie it up? Yeah. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3285.24s)]
*  You can freeze it and then unfreeze them and they'll stay [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3287.24s)]
*  alive. So they just go into [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3289.24s)]
*  some sort of catatonic paralysis [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3291.24s)]
*  because of the cold, and then they come back. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3293.24s)]
*  And you put a little [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3295.24s)]
*  leash on it and fly it around. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3297.24s)]
*  This is CKY2K, guys would do it. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3299.24s)]
*  And so I'm wondering if there's something like that [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3301.24s)]
*  with the human body. You freeze it and it comes back years [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3303.24s)]
*  later. That's the... Who was it? What movie was that? [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3305.24s)]
*  The... [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3307.24s)]
*  Star Wars, not Obi-Wan. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3309.24s)]
*  Harrison Ford. What's his name? A guy stuck in the ice? [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3313.24s)]
*  Han Solo. Han Solo. Didn't he get frozen? [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3315.24s)]
*  Right, yeah, I think so. And they brought him back [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3317.24s)]
*  and then, you know, Demolition Man, that fucking movie. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3319.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, that's what I assume [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3321.24s)]
*  Ted Williams is doing. That's crazy. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3323.24s)]
*  Yo, what's up with [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3325.24s)]
*  Disney losing the rights [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3327.24s)]
*  to the mouse? [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3329.24s)]
*  I know. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3331.24s)]
*  Is it the mouse? Like the [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3333.24s)]
*  Mickey Mouse trademark and shit? Yes. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3335.24s)]
*  Like apparently Disney's been fighting [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3337.24s)]
*  trademark laws [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3339.24s)]
*  in court for [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3341.24s)]
*  decades because they expire [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3343.24s)]
*  after... They're supposed to expire after X [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3345.24s)]
*  amount of years. But because their whole [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3347.24s)]
*  intellectual property is owning the right to [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3349.24s)]
*  these characters, they've been in court [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3351.24s)]
*  with them forever to continue to [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3353.24s)]
*  increase the amount of time that they can have [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3355.24s)]
*  the rights. Because the second you lose the right [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3357.24s)]
*  to all these characters, anybody can make a [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3359.24s)]
*  Mickey Mouse movie or Spider-Man movie or [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3361.24s)]
*  whatever the fuck. So what's up with that? [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3363.24s)]
*  So it has to be the old version of Mickey Mouse. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3365.24s)]
*  The more new versions of Mickey Mouse [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3367.24s)]
*  are still protected. But that original [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3369.24s)]
*  Steamboat Willie Mickey Mouse goes [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3371.24s)]
*  out of protections in 2024. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3373.24s)]
*  But even then, it's like [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3375.24s)]
*  anybody can use [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3377.24s)]
*  your main thing. Yeah. And the Steamboat [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3379.24s)]
*  Willie, that's an iconic Mickey Mouse. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3381.24s)]
*  Like if you bought... Nobody would think it's bootleg [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3383.24s)]
*  if you bought it four years from now from some guy on the street. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3385.24s)]
*  I think Winnie the Pooh just went out of [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3387.24s)]
*  trademark. So anybody could... [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3389.24s)]
*  It's almost like you've got to sabotage the character [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3391.24s)]
*  before it goes... [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3393.24s)]
*  Like you've got to put out a movie... What's up, Doug? [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3395.24s)]
*  Another character [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3397.24s)]
*  walking around in underwear. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3399.24s)]
*  Is it weird to see your sister in [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3401.24s)]
*  underwear, bro? How is that weird? [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3403.24s)]
*  How is that weird, dude? What's weird [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3405.24s)]
*  about that? [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3407.24s)]
*  How is that weird? [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3409.24s)]
*  How's that weird? [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3411.24s)]
*  How's that weird? [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3413.24s)]
*  I saw a laugh. I was like, what's that? [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3415.24s)]
*  I thought he was just laughing at Miles [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3417.24s)]
*  Known Useless shit. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3419.24s)]
*  Wow! Also, [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3421.24s)]
*  Winnie the Pooh's got no pants on. Wow, that was great. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3423.24s)]
*  Whatever, you had a Winnie the Pooh party. It's all good. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3425.24s)]
*  How's that weird? You never seen your brother in his underwear? [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3429.24s)]
*  No, but my family's naked. You see your dad's dick all the time. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3431.24s)]
*  I have a naked family. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3433.24s)]
*  I am a naked family. See how he owns it? [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3435.24s)]
*  Naked. Mom farted, titties out. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3437.24s)]
*  You made that shit weird as fuck, bro. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3439.24s)]
*  My mom's titties out. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3441.24s)]
*  But now I've got to lean into a lie, bro. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3443.24s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3445.24s)]
*  None of y'all moms wore a baggy shirt, titties flopped out from the side. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3447.24s)]
*  That's my point. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3449.24s)]
*  That's my point. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3451.24s)]
*  I don't want to lean into this. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3453.24s)]
*  Y'all never seen your mom in a tank top, [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3455.24s)]
*  titties on the side flopping out. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3457.24s)]
*  Y'all never seen that. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3459.24s)]
*  Y'all never seen your mom's titties looking like [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3461.24s)]
*  a dachshund's ears. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3463.24s)]
*  Y'all never seen that once. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3465.24s)]
*  I'm just saying, that happens. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3467.24s)]
*  In my family, that happens. Dad's dick swinging. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3469.24s)]
*  Like Winnie the Pooh. My dad walks around like Winnie the Pooh. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3471.24s)]
*  Do you want to lean into this? [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3473.24s)]
*  My dad wasn't at house. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3475.24s)]
*  His dick was swinging elsewhere. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3477.24s)]
*  I know. I miss the dick swings, bro. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3479.24s)]
*  I'm just saying, we're very naked family. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3481.24s)]
*  Naked family. You have a naked family? [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3483.24s)]
*  Or no? [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3485.24s)]
*  I mean, my mom would do the big shirt, but she didn't have [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3487.24s)]
*  holes in the side, so. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3489.24s)]
*  But she would do the big shirt when them titties was going crazy with all due respect. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3491.24s)]
*  With all due respect. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3493.24s)]
*  But with all due respect, they would go crazy or no? [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3495.24s)]
*  It's with all due respect. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3497.24s)]
*  It's with all due respect. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3499.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3501.24s)]
*  You gotta lean in now. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3503.24s)]
*  Akash's mom's going crazy. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=3505.24s)]

*  I did a stream, I was like, yo, I'm gonna stream every cowboy game. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4079.24s)]
*  I think we're gonna have a great year. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4081.24s)]
*  I was playing with the Avery over from San Fran [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4083.24s)]
*  and the cowboys just got rinsed [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4085.24s)]
*  like I've never seen in my life as a sports fan. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4087.24s)]
*  I've never seen two teams that are supposed to be good [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4091.24s)]
*  and one get destroyed this badly. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4093.24s)]
*  I mean, Jets aren't supposed to be good. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4095.24s)]
*  I mean, the 49ers aren't supposed to be good. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4097.24s)]
*  Well, they are. They're good. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4099.24s)]
*  The cowboys are supposed to be good. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4101.24s)]

*  Yeah, the thing with their coach. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4105.24s)]
*  The defense is good and everything else. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4107.24s)]
*  And the defense and the run scheme this guy draws up is always so good. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4109.24s)]
*  The thing with his team is he's not great, but he's good enough with that coach. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4111.24s)]
*  Kyle Shanahan. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4113.24s)]

*  Everything else. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4117.24s)]
*  A game manager? [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4119.24s)]
*  Yeah, and he had some fucking dimes last night. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4121.24s)]
*  I don't know if it was terrible coverage or what, [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4123.24s)]
*  but this guy, I mean, it was so embarrassing for three and a half hours to sit there. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4125.24s)]
*  You don't think about a livestream [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4127.24s)]
*  for an entire game if you're getting destroyed. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4129.24s)]
*  So I have to sit there [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4131.24s)]
*  sinking lower and lower into my couch. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4133.24s)]
*  Vala came through and we made a deal [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4135.24s)]
*  that for every touchdown the Niners scored toward the end, [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4137.24s)]
*  I would take half an edible. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4139.24s)]
*  So I just got zooted by the end of the stream. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4141.24s)]
*  It was just a miserable fucking time. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4143.24s)]
*  Depressed and high, [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4145.24s)]
*  sunken into a couch and it's 42 to 14 or whatever it is. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4147.24s)]
*  42 to 10. It was unbelievable. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4149.24s)]
*  So is Cowboy Nation demoralized in terms of their hopes for this season? [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4151.24s)]
*  I'm broken. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4153.24s)]
*  I was wrong. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4155.24s)]
*  Because y'all were gassed up. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4157.24s)]
*  I was wrong. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4159.24s)]
*  Every season they get like this. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4161.24s)]
*  I don't normally. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4163.24s)]
*  I was this season all in. I was with everyone. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4165.24s)]
*  You ever heard me say Cowboys are going to the Super Bowl for real? [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4167.24s)]
*  This time I picked you. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4169.24s)]
*  He said for real. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4171.24s)]
*  This year, that's what I'm saying. This year I was completely wrong. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4173.24s)]
*  But Cowboys fans do that every year. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4175.24s)]
*  Me, this year I was like, nah they're right. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4177.24s)]
*  We got it. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4179.24s)]
*  Shout out to prize picks. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4181.24s)]
*  I've been making a lot of money with every pick being wrong. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4183.24s)]
*  Yo, my pick's killed this week. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4185.24s)]
*  You just pick opposite of me. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4187.24s)]
*  My pick's killed this week. I ain't gonna lie. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4189.24s)]
*  Shout out to prize picks though, by the way. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4191.24s)]
*  Also if you're gonna pick them up this week. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4193.24s)]
*  What did you pick up this week? [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4195.24s)]
*  PrizePicks.com. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4197.24s)]
*  Use the promo code Schultz. They're gonna match your initial deposit up to $100. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4199.24s)]
*  You put $100 in, they're gonna match it to $100. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4201.24s)]
*  I think I made people, let's say this week, [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4203.24s)]
*  I think we got $2,500 and then plus another $1,500. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4205.24s)]
*  So that would have been $4,000. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4211.24s)]
*  $4,000? You're welcome. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4213.24s)]
*  You're welcome if you're throwing down like we were throwing down. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4215.24s)]
*  Alright, on my picks, [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4217.24s)]
*  remember, don't pick what I'm picking. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4219.24s)]
*  Devin A. Chan, more than 66.5 rushing yards. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4221.24s)]
*  I believe that for the Dolphins. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4223.24s)]
*  And Tyree Kill, more than half a touchdown. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4225.24s)]
*  Also for the Dolphins. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4227.24s)]
*  I'm riding with the Dolphins. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4229.24s)]
*  Which makes logical sense, but again, [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4231.24s)]
*  don't listen to me at prize picks. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4233.24s)]
*  Go to prize picks, say what did Akash do? [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4235.24s)]
*  Do the opposite! [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4237.24s)]
*  That's your fucking motto for 2023 and you're gonna make a lot of money. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4239.24s)]
*  PrizePicks.com. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4241.24s)]
*  Promo code Schultz. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4243.24s)]
*  Anything else in the port this? [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4245.24s)]
*  We got basketball starting back up, obviously big trade. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4247.24s)]
*  Yeah, we didn't talk about the trade at all. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4249.24s)]
*  The game trade is really interesting. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4251.24s)]
*  How do you feel as a Knicks fan? [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4255.24s)]
*  I think this is just kind of a nothing burger season for the Knicks. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4257.24s)]
*  We didn't make any big changes. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4263.24s)]
*  We didn't get any talent. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4265.24s)]
*  There's nothing new that we have and what we had wasn't good enough. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4267.24s)]
*  But I guess the fans are saying whenever salary cap space opens up, [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4269.24s)]
*  Yannis. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4273.24s)]
*  Yannis is who you want. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4275.24s)]
*  They're like, Yannis, Yannis, Yannis. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4277.24s)]
*  And then Dane just came to Milwaukee. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4279.24s)]
*  That's the thing. That's why it kind of fucks you up. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4281.24s)]
*  Because that was the big, I guess the Joel Embiid is the backup. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4283.24s)]
*  But people were thinking Yannis is not happy in Milwaukee. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4285.24s)]
*  They're not gonna do anything. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4287.24s)]
*  But now, the question now is does Milwaukee have enough talent to actually do it? [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4289.24s)]
*  They have enough talent in terms of Yannis and Dane, obviously. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4295.24s)]
*  But do they have defensive talent? [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4299.24s)]
*  Drew would lock down any. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4301.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing. Giving up Drew Hurd's student. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4303.24s)]
*  And Dane's not, I love Dane but he's not a good defender. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4305.24s)]
*  Also, you know, Dane, loyalty Dane, requested a trade from the Blazers and then got divorced after he got traded within like a week. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4307.24s)]
*  Oh, he's about to win a championship. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4313.24s)]
*  Fuck all this loyalty shit. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4315.24s)]
*  I need a ring. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4317.24s)]
*  Dude, he made some room. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4319.24s)]
*  I'm gonna lose one ring. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4321.24s)]
*  Just take another. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4323.24s)]
*  Shout out to Dane, man. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4325.24s)]
*  Yeah, Dane is fucking incredible. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4327.24s)]
*  So it's gonna be interesting to see what happens with Milwaukee. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4329.24s)]
*  I'm shocked that they didn't get that Miami deal done. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4331.24s)]
*  Dane in Miami with Jimmy Butler. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4333.24s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4335.24s)]
*  Because Jimmy's got maybe another year or two at elite play probably. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4337.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4339.24s)]
*  And so there's a two year window for him to get it done. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4341.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4343.24s)]
*  So if I'm Dane, you get to be one in Miami. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4345.24s)]
*  You're single? You want to be in fucking Milwaukee? [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4347.24s)]
*  That's probably why he wanted the Miami trade. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4349.24s)]
*  I think he was thinking, you know what? [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4351.24s)]
*  I'm getting divorced if I'm going to Miami. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4353.24s)]
*  Let's just get ahead of it. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4355.24s)]
*  I heard Pat Riley made them one offer. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4357.24s)]
*  They pitched Pat something else and then he never turned the phone call. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4359.24s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4361.24s)]
*  Pat don't play games. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4363.24s)]
*  Pat don't play games. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4365.24s)]
*  I mean, I guess, dude, but you got a window. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4367.24s)]
*  They just weren't as good as the Nuggets in the finals. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4369.24s)]
*  They just weren't flat out. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4371.24s)]
*  Al said that too. I think you called in five. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4373.24s)]
*  I think they wanted first round, [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4375.24s)]
*  sorry, they wanted draft picks. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4377.24s)]
*  And Miami's like, okay, [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4379.24s)]
*  if we have a couple more years left on Jimmy's contract, [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4381.24s)]
*  we can't give up our future [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4383.24s)]
*  for two more years. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4385.24s)]
*  So they have to continue developing. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4387.24s)]
*  And what Miami's done really well is just cultivated this team [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4389.24s)]
*  that makes the playoffs, makes it very far, [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4391.24s)]
*  make it to the finals. Heat culture. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4393.24s)]
*  Heat culture and they invest in their future potentially. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4395.24s)]
*  Now they'd be giving up the whole thing [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4397.24s)]
*  for adding a player [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4399.24s)]
*  who may or may not be able to put them over. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4401.24s)]
*  I don't know if he does. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4403.24s)]
*  We haven't seen just yet. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4405.24s)]
*  Do you think Jimmy has two more years? [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4407.24s)]
*  No, I think Jimmy can play until he's 40 if he wants, [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4409.24s)]
*  but dominate a game, [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4411.24s)]
*  elite NBA player. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4413.24s)]
*  By himself. By himself. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4415.24s)]
*  I think that that start, you need some help after that. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4417.24s)]
*  Like, when we watched Jimmy do, [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4419.24s)]
*  and most people would not put Jimmy in as a top five NBA player, [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4421.24s)]
*  but what we watched him do is in the playoffs, [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4423.24s)]
*  be a top five NBA player. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4425.24s)]
*  How many more years can he do that [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4427.24s)]
*  where he just literally rolls his ankle [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4429.24s)]
*  and then comes back and drops 40 [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4431.24s)]
*  or whatever the fuck he was doing? [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4433.24s)]
*  Like, that dominates. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4435.24s)]
*  I don't know. Two, three? [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4437.24s)]
*  The Knicks probably would have gone... [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4439.24s)]
*  Imagine we had Jimmy Butler. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4441.24s)]
*  The Knicks would love this fucking guy. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4443.24s)]
*  And I just love how [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4445.24s)]
*  individual he is. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4447.24s)]
*  Like, he's part of this team where he sacrifices [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4449.24s)]
*  whatever he needs for the greater good of the team, [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4451.24s)]
*  but in his personal life, [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4453.24s)]
*  nobody's telling him what he can or can't do [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4455.24s)]
*  because of who he is. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4457.24s)]
*  Like, coming in dressed as the goth dude, [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4459.24s)]
*  having the fucking extension dreads last time. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4461.24s)]
*  He's just having fun. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4463.24s)]
*  Genuinely funny. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4465.24s)]
*  We would have loved that. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4467.24s)]
*  He's a superstar. He'd be an absolute superstar. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4469.24s)]
*  What happened with John Marant? [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4471.24s)]
*  Is there any... [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4473.24s)]
*  That's right. He got like that... [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4475.24s)]
*  What is it, 20 games? [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4477.24s)]
*  25, I think, right? 25-game suspension. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4479.24s)]
*  So he's going to have to serve that suspension, [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4481.24s)]
*  come back from that, and he'll definitely be a knucklehead again, [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4483.24s)]
*  and then get suspended again. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4485.24s)]
*  Almost 100% guaranteed. I hope Derrick Rose can help him. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4487.24s)]
*  I hope Derrick Rose can help him. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4489.24s)]
*  There's no help. I mean, you haven't heard anything from him. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4491.24s)]
*  It seems like he's focused, or at least out of the spotlight. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4493.24s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4495.24s)]
*  I just can't believe he would even let it get to where it is. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4497.24s)]
*  It was just so many mistakes. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4499.24s)]
*  And I love John, but it was just constant fucking up. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4501.24s)]
*  But he's so talented, dude. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4503.24s)]
*  And likeable on the court. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4505.24s)]
*  You love this guy. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4507.24s)]
*  I mean, the league is his, if he could get his... [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4509.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4511.24s)]
*  Yeah, if he could get his shit together, [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4513.24s)]
*  they'd literally hand him the league. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4515.24s)]
*  But now they have to be concerned about handing him the league. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4517.24s)]
*  Now they've got to ride Steph a little bit more. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4519.24s)]
*  It looked like the NBA was ready. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4521.24s)]
*  It looked like they were ready, and then... [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4523.24s)]
*  Obviously, this shit happens, and they're like, [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4525.24s)]
*  okay, Steph, there you go. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4527.24s)]
*  Put the league back on your fucking shoulders. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4529.24s)]
*  If he can stay in line, he'll be a billionaire. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4531.24s)]
*  Like, just the way athlete contracts are going, [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4533.24s)]
*  the fortunes they're amassing, [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4535.24s)]
*  the opportunities that present themselves to them. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4537.24s)]
*  Oh, the sneakers. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4539.24s)]
*  He's the first guy I've seen in a while that has a style of play [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4541.24s)]
*  that makes you want to buy a sneaker. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4543.24s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4545.24s)]
*  Like, Kyrie, regardless of his political beliefs, [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4547.24s)]
*  has a style of play where you go, [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4549.24s)]
*  I mean, all right, just let me get the sneakers. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4551.24s)]
*  Maybe that will help. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4553.24s)]
*  I remember buying Steph's sneakers. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4555.24s)]
*  Like, does this help you balance better? [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4557.24s)]
*  I knew it was irrational and dumb, [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4559.24s)]
*  but it still got me to buy it. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4561.24s)]
*  I think that's a lot of times we've spoken about this on the pod, [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4563.24s)]
*  but you don't buy big man sneakers because you don't want to play like them. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4565.24s)]
*  We want to play like Michael Jordan. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4567.24s)]
*  You want to play like Kyrie. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4569.24s)]
*  I remember looking at the Kyries, and they said that [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4571.24s)]
*  the soles were made [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4575.24s)]
*  to replicate a motorcycle tire. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4577.24s)]
*  So there was no hard edge on them. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4581.24s)]
*  It's a rounded edge so you could get the traction [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4583.24s)]
*  when you're pushing on the side. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4585.24s)]
*  And I'm watching this and I'm like, [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4587.24s)]
*  that's why. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4589.24s)]
*  That's why. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4591.24s)]
*  I bought David Beckham, please, [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4593.24s)]
*  because it had the metal in the bottom [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4595.24s)]
*  so that when you kicked it, it would push the metal [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4597.24s)]
*  and then it would make the ball spin more. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4599.24s)]
*  Didn't work. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4601.24s)]
*  You buy them because you see someone do something so unique. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4603.24s)]
*  I did it when I was 12, though. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4605.24s)]
*  Damn, I did that shit at 35. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4607.24s)]
*  You're the best salesman on EasySold. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4611.24s)]
*  That's what I noticed in my life. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4613.24s)]
*  But you need that game, and Ja has that game, [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4615.24s)]
*  which is like, [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4617.24s)]
*  he's bigger than Iverson was, [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4619.24s)]
*  but the aggressiveness [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4621.24s)]
*  and straightforward attack. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4623.24s)]
*  Iverson wasn't thrown down like that. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4625.24s)]
*  Iverson could dunk, obviously, but not like Ja. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4627.24s)]
*  So yeah, let's see what happens. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4629.24s)]
*  You brought a Beckham. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4631.24s)]
*  You said you really like the documentary. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4633.24s)]
*  I've been hearing about this documentary. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4635.24s)]
*  The documentary's good. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4637.24s)]
*  It's the first Travis, Kelsey, and Taylor Swift, the OG. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4639.24s)]
*  That's a good-ass point. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4641.24s)]
*  Did you see it? [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4643.24s)]
*  My wife's been watching it, so I've been picking up little parts. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4645.24s)]
*  And she'll pass out, and I'll just keep watching. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4647.24s)]
*  That's how I know if something's good. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4649.24s)]
*  And really fun. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4651.24s)]
*  He's great. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4653.24s)]
*  And obviously, it's a documentary, [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4655.24s)]
*  so it's accentuating the best parts of him. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4657.24s)]
*  I thought it was, I don't know soccer, [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4659.24s)]
*  so you tell me. It felt like OD. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4661.24s)]
*  Jordan documentary, [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4663.24s)]
*  he's undeniably top two [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4665.24s)]
*  at the very least best basketball player of all time [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4667.24s)]
*  in the entire history of the universe. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4669.24s)]
*  I don't ever hear people put Beckham top five, top ten. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4671.24s)]
*  And the way they're talking about him, [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4673.24s)]
*  it's like, this is the greatest player to ever set foot on grass. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4675.24s)]
*  To me, I thought he was, [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4679.24s)]
*  because that was the only player I heard of as a young kid in soccer. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4681.24s)]
*  He was the icon. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4685.24s)]
*  He was the icon. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4687.24s)]
*  But my friends who knew soccer were like, yeah, he's good. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4689.24s)]
*  That's it. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4691.24s)]
*  My takeaway, [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4693.24s)]
*  maybe because I already knew that he was [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4695.24s)]
*  a really good player, [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4697.24s)]
*  and not the number one guy in the world at the time, [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4699.24s)]
*  my takeaway was more personality-wise. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4701.24s)]
*  I saw him as a quite well-rounded individual, [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4703.24s)]
*  not too pompous or arrogant, [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4707.24s)]
*  kind of hard-working player, [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4709.24s)]
*  until, what was the guy, Sir Alex Ferguson? [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4711.24s)]
*  Until he separated and went and played in Real Madrid or whatever, [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4715.24s)]
*  kind of humble, almost respectful of this guy [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4719.24s)]
*  who's his coach since he was a teenager, [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4721.24s)]
*  which I didn't expect from him. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4723.24s)]
*  I didn't expect that from him. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4725.24s)]
*  He comes off almost like a working-class bloke, [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4727.24s)]
*  which I knew him as a fashion icon. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4733.24s)]
*  So it was really refreshing to see. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4735.24s)]
*  I felt he was closer to that than he was portraying himself. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4739.24s)]
*  I feel like the guy was modeling, [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4743.24s)]
*  and then he acts like, dude, I just wanted to play football, [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4747.24s)]
*  and I don't know what's happening around me. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4749.24s)]
*  I missed the birth of my daughter to go do a photo shoot with J.Lo and Beyoncé, [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4751.24s)]
*  and I'm just a working-class bloke who loves Guinness. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4755.24s)]
*  And this genius of documentary, you can curate whoever you want. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4758.24s)]
*  I saw this one clip going around where she was capping. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4761.24s)]
*  She was like, oh yeah, I grew up on middle class. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4765.24s)]
*  Dude, this is the genius, though, [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4767.24s)]
*  is he does that to his wife and then nobody does that to him? [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4769.24s)]
*  But you watch that moment and you're like, [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4771.24s)]
*  they were authentic in the documentary. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4773.24s)]
*  She'd be capping more than him, though. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4775.24s)]
*  He don't really brag a lot. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4777.24s)]
*  He reacts to the game, [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4779.24s)]
*  and they do a really cool visual effect [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4781.24s)]
*  where he's watching the game through the lens. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4783.24s)]
*  So they can, you get his, [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4785.24s)]
*  so visually imagine there's a camera behind the screen [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4787.24s)]
*  that he's watching the game. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4791.24s)]
*  So you get his in-the-moment reactions to his plays. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4793.24s)]
*  So he's watching like this. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4795.24s)]
*  He's looking into your eyes. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4797.24s)]
*  Yeah, it was really cool. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4799.24s)]
*  He did cap on the affair thing, though. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4801.24s)]
*  They kind of touch on it a little bit, [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4803.24s)]
*  and he was like, that was a really tough time for us, man. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4805.24s)]
*  People were trying to tear us apart, [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4807.24s)]
*  and it's like, tough time for us. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4809.24s)]
*  You're throwing us out, Victoria, [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4811.24s)]
*  and I had to fight for each other. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4813.24s)]
*  She was yelling at you for two years straight. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4815.24s)]
*  This is a very funny... [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4817.24s)]
*  But did he fuck the girl? What was the deal? [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4819.24s)]
*  Yeah, I'm fairly certain. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4821.24s)]
*  It was enough that he had to address it. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4823.24s)]
*  And if he didn't fuck her, he'd probably take that documentary [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4825.24s)]
*  to be like, I didn't touch this girl. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4827.24s)]
*  What are you guys talking about? [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4829.24s)]
*  Oh, yeah, exactly. He didn't ever say he didn't do it. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4831.24s)]
*  He was just like, we had to really fight to save our marriage. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4833.24s)]
*  It was important for us to be there for each other. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4835.24s)]
*  And it's like, well, this is a funny way of putting it. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4837.24s)]
*  That's why I felt like he capped when he needed to cap. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4839.24s)]
*  She capped on like, I'm working class, [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4841.24s)]
*  and he capped on like... [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4843.24s)]
*  I'm faithful. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4845.24s)]
*  I'm a great husband and a working class guy. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4847.24s)]
*  How good was he? [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4849.24s)]
*  He was like the star of England, arguably. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4851.24s)]
*  He was like their guy, set piece dude, [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4853.24s)]
*  like winning... [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4855.24s)]
*  You see it in the documentary, when he gets the red card [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4857.24s)]
*  and they lose on PKs to Brazil or whatever, [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4859.24s)]
*  or Argentina, [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4861.24s)]
*  they blame him, [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4863.24s)]
*  because he was like a lynchpin, he was the captain of England. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4865.24s)]
*  When you're the captain of a country that is like the epicenter of European soccer, [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4867.24s)]
*  you're raised to a higher level. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4871.24s)]
*  Of course. You're like being the best player on the Knicks. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4873.24s)]
*  You don't have to be the best player on the... [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4875.24s)]
*  Or the best player on the Cowboys, the quarterback. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4877.24s)]
*  You don't have to be the best when you're held to them. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4879.24s)]
*  And then he's also married and has a kid with the biggest pop star in England. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4881.24s)]
*  And then he's also just extremely handsome. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4883.24s)]
*  He's so hot, dude. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4885.24s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4887.24s)]
*  You didn't realize it when he's younger. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4889.24s)]
*  Shaves his head, gets hotter. That's when I was like, this guy's a smoke shaker. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4891.24s)]
*  Can't lose. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4893.24s)]
*  Ronaldo. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4895.24s)]
*  David Beckham's on another planet. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4897.24s)]
*  I think it's Beckham, dude. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4899.24s)]
*  Beckham might be up there. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4901.24s)]
*  When you see him with the shaved head, you're like, dude, this guy is sex. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4903.24s)]
*  Pure sex. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4905.24s)]
*  Pure sex, dude. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4907.24s)]
*  But to be a star athlete... [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4909.24s)]
*  Watch it, dude, and you'll see what I mean. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4911.24s)]
*  What other athlete is as handsome as Beckham? [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4913.24s)]
*  LeBron. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4915.24s)]
*  Why y'all laugh, bro? [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4917.24s)]
*  I mean, I said it so y'all would laugh, but that's how I feel about LeBron. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4919.24s)]
*  No, he's not David Beckham. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4921.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4923.24s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4925.24s)]
*  I think if he saw it, he'd be like, yeah, I know, Beckham. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4927.24s)]
*  LeBron's toes alone, I think, disqualify him from the Beckham combo. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4929.24s)]
*  Tiger Woods? [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4931.24s)]
*  Nah, nah, nah, come on, man. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4933.24s)]
*  That's what I'm saying, bro. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4935.24s)]
*  Not even close. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4937.24s)]
*  No one that's as good that's as handsome. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4939.24s)]
*  It's very rare. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4941.24s)]
*  Tom Brady. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4943.24s)]
*  And Ronaldo. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4945.24s)]
*  Okay, so, documentary you thought was fair to his skill level? [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4947.24s)]
*  Like, he was... [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4949.24s)]
*  He was excelling and doing some pretty cool things. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4951.24s)]
*  For the teams he was playing for, yeah, absolutely. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4953.24s)]
*  I thought so. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4955.24s)]
*  But I'm also tainted. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4957.24s)]
*  I grew up watching him and being like, oh yeah, this is the best. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4959.24s)]
*  I bought the cleats. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4961.24s)]
*  I was like, dude, the fucking... [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4963.24s)]
*  Yeah, the dust in it. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4965.24s)]
*  Could he do something that other players can do? [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4967.24s)]
*  That bend it shit? [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4969.24s)]
*  Because that's the only thing I heard from him. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4971.24s)]
*  The only thing I found out about him was from the movie. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4973.24s)]
*  I was a little salty and bring up that Indian movie, by the way. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4975.24s)]
*  He was good at set pieces and had legendary free kicks. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4977.24s)]
*  He had like one insane game. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4979.24s)]
*  So he had some very clutch moments. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4981.24s)]
*  And then he also was very good at setting people up around the net, right? [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4983.24s)]
*  So it's weird, like when you're a casual soccer fan, [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4985.24s)]
*  it doesn't seem like it's hard to just kick the ball high and then people head it in. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4987.24s)]
*  But placing that, I guess, is a very difficult skill. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4989.24s)]
*  And you have to be really good at it. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4991.24s)]
*  So people respected his assisting ability. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4993.24s)]
*  I think so. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4995.24s)]
*  I'm not like an expert in backgammon. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4997.24s)]
*  I didn't watch him at the time. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=4999.24s)]
*  I was like, I'm not an expert in backgammon. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5001.24s)]
*  I was like, I'm not an expert in backgammon. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5003.24s)]
*  I was like, I'm not an expert in backgammon. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5005.24s)]
*  I didn't watch him at the time with soccer IQ. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5007.24s)]
*  But yeah, he was like known for set pieces. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5009.24s)]
*  And so corners, free kicks, and having clutch moments. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5011.24s)]
*  And so corners, free kicks, and having clutch moments. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5013.24s)]
*  It was 2002 World Cup where they won against Greece. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5015.24s)]
*  It was 2002 World Cup where they won against Greece. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5017.24s)]
*  This might be OD, but was there a time when he was considered the best player in the world? [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5019.24s)]
*  This might be OD, but was there a time when he was considered the best player in the world? [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5021.24s)]
*  No. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5023.24s)]
*  Not of all time, in the world. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5025.24s)]
*  Because at the time he's playing against OG Ronaldo, [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5027.24s)]
*  which was like unstoppable. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5029.24s)]
*  He wasn't the best player on his team. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5031.24s)]
*  When he was playing Real Madrid. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5033.24s)]
*  There were probably multiple people that were better. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5035.24s)]
*  That's where I was like, [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5037.24s)]
*  I feel like they're the way they talk. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5039.24s)]
*  It's the same way they talk about Jordan on the last dance. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5041.24s)]
*  And that's a fluff piece, but it's in Jordan. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5043.24s)]
*  But he might be the most famous in the world. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5045.24s)]
*  And it was cool, the owner of the Real Madrid. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5047.24s)]
*  There's a really cool moment where they [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5049.24s)]
*  asked the owner of Real Madrid, [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5051.24s)]
*  like why did you sign him? [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5053.24s)]
*  You already had this other guy named Luis Figo, [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5055.24s)]
*  I think it was his name. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5057.24s)]
*  Because you already had this other guy named Luis Figo playing on the right. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5059.24s)]
*  And the owner just goes, [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5061.24s)]
*  because he was going to make us millions of dollars. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5063.24s)]
*  He tripled our revenue. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5065.24s)]
*  He just says it. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5067.24s)]
*  He tripled our revenue. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5069.24s)]
*  Literally they're doing these, [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5071.24s)]
*  what do you call it, friendlies or something like that? [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5073.24s)]
*  They take the team on the road, [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5075.24s)]
*  and they play these games, [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5077.24s)]
*  like they'll do it sometimes at MetLife, [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5079.24s)]
*  for Yankee Stadium here. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5081.24s)]
*  And it's just an opportunity for people to go see these iconic teams [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5083.24s)]
*  in different places. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5085.24s)]
*  But they get paid so much fucking money to do something like that. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5087.24s)]
*  So you add a superstar like Beckham, [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5089.24s)]
*  who's the most popular player in the world at this time, [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5091.24s)]
*  you take him to fucking China. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5093.24s)]
*  And the circus around him is crazy. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5095.24s)]
*  The fame level is nuts. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5097.24s)]
*  That's something that I admire, how they handled it. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5099.24s)]
*  Like yeah, okay, you got some pussy on the side or whatever. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5101.24s)]
*  But like, their ability [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5103.24s)]
*  to withstand that type of pressure [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5105.24s)]
*  and remain [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5107.24s)]
*  somewhat normal, [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5109.24s)]
*  both of them seem kind of cool [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5111.24s)]
*  when you talk to them. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5113.24s)]
*  And I don't mean cool in terms of [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5115.24s)]
*  how they look or dress. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5117.24s)]
*  Like I don't give a fuck about the tattoos. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5119.24s)]
*  Like grounded. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5121.24s)]

*  Yeah, they're quite interesting. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5141.24s)]
*  That's a good point, to be that famous. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5143.24s)]
*  Even if you're acting a little more humble than you are [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5145.24s)]
*  to not be a complete egomaniac, nutbag [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5147.24s)]
*  at that level of fame, you've got to commend that. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5149.24s)]
*  To go and open the door [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5151.24s)]

*  and play with some guys. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5347.24s)]
*  It's such good PR. We gotta promote the movies. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5349.24s)]
*  He just goes and plays pick up. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5351.24s)]
*  It's perfect. I don't want a podcast. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5353.24s)]
*  Alright, fine. I'll hoop with some strangers. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5355.24s)]
*  Did you see the Psy concert [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5357.24s)]
*  in Korea? Now, I've seen this clip. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5359.24s)]
*  So Psy is obviously [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5361.24s)]
*  Gangnam Style, and it shows him [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5363.24s)]
*  popping out of a [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5365.24s)]
*  hole, I guess, [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5367.24s)]
*  underneath the stage. It's like a little elevator. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5369.24s)]
*  So sick. And they just perform for all [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5371.24s)]
*  of Korea, but they do this every summer. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5373.24s)]
*  So this is like his summer concert, [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5375.24s)]
*  apparently. And they've been doing [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5377.24s)]
*  it for like 20 years or some shit like that. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5379.24s)]
*  Yeah, but look at this. Watch, it's crazy. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5381.24s)]
*  I mean, crazy. And people are going nuts. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5385.24s)]
*  I mean, look at that. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5387.24s)]
*  I mean, that's insane. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5389.24s)]
*  I mean... [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5391.24s)]
*  Kind of a legend, right? Oh, what a legend. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5393.24s)]
*  I saw him perform live. Wait, but [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5395.24s)]
*  has he just performed that one song? [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5397.24s)]
*  No, he's a big artist there. We just got [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5399.24s)]
*  Gangnam Style. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5401.24s)]
*  But I saw him live at the VMAs, [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5403.24s)]
*  or sorry, the EMAs when I was in Europe. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5405.24s)]
*  That's his song, Oberyn. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5407.24s)]
*  Just torn in the back. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5409.24s)]
*  He was the best performer on the show [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5411.24s)]
*  by far, to the [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5413.24s)]
*  point where they didn't plan on putting him in the [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5415.24s)]
*  show, and [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5417.24s)]
*  they changed the edit to include him. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5419.24s)]
*  And I'm telling you, [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5421.24s)]
*  by far, the best performer. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5423.24s)]
*  And not just because the song was hot, [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5425.24s)]
*  they had other big fucking musicians there. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5427.24s)]
*  This is the European Music Awards, [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5429.24s)]
*  or whatever. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5431.24s)]
*  Murdered everybody. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5433.24s)]
*  Murdered. Unbelievable talent. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5435.24s)]
*  Engaging. Dance. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5437.24s)]
*  He looks dopey, [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5439.24s)]
*  and he looks like he runs a [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5441.24s)]
*  fucking dry cleaning business, but [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5443.24s)]
*  in reality, the guy is a fucking superstar. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5445.24s)]
*  It was unbelievable to see. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5447.24s)]
*  The shows are apparently four hours long. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5449.24s)]
*  So long, sometimes they take a break [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5451.24s)]
*  for people to catch their breath. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5453.24s)]
*  Did you see them cool down the audience with sprinklers? [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5455.24s)]
*  Yeah, that was cool. Literally, everyone's dancing, [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5457.24s)]
*  and they're like, okay, we gotta chill the audience [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5459.24s)]
*  down because they're going too crazy. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5461.24s)]
*  And they fucking put sprinklers to cool everyone down. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5463.24s)]
*  Three hours in. People are sweating so bad. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5465.24s)]
*  That's dope. Cool. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5467.24s)]
*  That would be cool. I would love to see [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5469.24s)]
*  Bad Bunny in [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5471.24s)]
*  Puerto Rico. He's from Puerto Rico, right? [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5473.24s)]
*  I'd love to see the biggest Brazilian [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5475.24s)]
*  artist in Brazil. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5477.24s)]
*  See Psy [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5479.24s)]
*  in South Korea. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5481.24s)]
*  That'd be a cool cultural moment. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5483.24s)]
*  Like seeing [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5485.24s)]
*  Shakira at the height [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5487.24s)]
*  of her fame in Colombia. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5489.24s)]
*  She from Colombia? Yeah. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5491.24s)]
*  Maybe she's from Colombia, right? [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5493.24s)]
*  Seeing that energy around it. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5495.24s)]
*  I feel like Koreans, [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5497.24s)]
*  I think they party different though. They're like a unit. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5499.24s)]
*  They're like militant partiers. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5501.24s)]
*  You see them go, they're all linked up, [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5503.24s)]
*  all in unison. I feel like you go to Puerto Rico, [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5505.24s)]
*  they might be doing their own thing. What do you think, Al? [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5507.24s)]
*  Be honest. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5509.24s)]
*  Bad Bunny's performing. I feel like Puerto Ricans are not [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5511.24s)]
*  in unison like the Koreans. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5513.24s)]
*  You guys, you're saying, [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5515.24s)]
*  what are you saying? Yeah, what are you saying? [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5517.24s)]
*  I think Koreans are the most militant partiers, dude. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5519.24s)]
*  Like these are fucking organized people. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5521.24s)]
*  You see the video, they all are linked up. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5523.24s)]
*  They all have the same, why are you guys [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5525.24s)]
*  not rivaling each other? What the fuck? [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5527.24s)]
*  Just saying. Sounds like you're making [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5529.24s)]
*  a statement about Puerto Ricans. Yeah, I know. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5531.24s)]
*  Puerto Ricans are less organized, dude. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5533.24s)]
*  If you go to a Puerto Rican concert, people are going to be doing their own [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5535.24s)]
*  things. You gotta get out of Willisburg, they get it to you, right? [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5537.24s)]
*  No, bro. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5539.24s)]
*  Puerto Ricans are. That is true. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5541.24s)]
*  They've been fucking bugging me. I live above the Social Club, dude. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5543.24s)]
*  Oh, that's fine. Wait, what? [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5545.24s)]
*  I live above the Puerto Rican Social Club. Which is? [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5547.24s)]
*  The fucking, where the Puerto Ricans link up, [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5549.24s)]
*  that's Mecca. But is there an indoor [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5551.24s)]
*  location for that? [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5553.24s)]
*  No. It's indoor and then it goes through [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5555.24s)]
*  and then it goes underneath my balcony. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5557.24s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5559.24s)]
*  Every night. Yeah. Bugging me, dude. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5561.24s)]
*  I wish I had the Korean Social Club. Be much more quiet, [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5563.24s)]
*  I think. Much more polite. It would end at 12. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5565.24s)]
*  But no. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5567.24s)]
*  Not these Puerto Ricans, dude. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5569.24s)]
*  Do you not agree? [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5571.24s)]
*  What is happening right now? [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5573.24s)]
*  Why are you all icing me right now, dude? [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5575.24s)]
*  The whole Koreans [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5577.24s)]
*  party more militant. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5579.24s)]
*  Why would you do this? Why would you do this? [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5581.24s)]
*  What's wrong with seeing your sister in underwear [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5583.24s)]
*  the Koreans are wearing? [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5585.24s)]
*  What is happening? [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5587.24s)]
*  Puerto Ricans got your whole family [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5589.24s)]
*  in them drawers, bro. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5591.24s)]
*  He's a Puerto Rican, boy. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5593.24s)]
*  Shit. Oh my God. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5595.24s)]
*  No, you're good. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5597.24s)]
*  Oh my God. Okay, what else we got, Mark? [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5599.24s)]
*  Give us one more. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5601.24s)]
*  Oh, we gotta talk about the fight. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5603.24s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5605.24s)]
*  We coming out next week. Is it happening? [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5607.24s)]
*  Yo, Dylan's there. Yeah. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5609.24s)]
*  He seems ready, man. He ain't flying all the way out [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5611.24s)]
*  to Manchester to pull out. Yeah. I think Dylan's [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5613.24s)]
*  fighting, yo. I think [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5615.24s)]
*  Dylan truly believes he can win. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5617.24s)]
*  Oh yeah. He believes it. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5619.24s)]
*  I think Dylan thinks... I think he can win. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5621.24s)]
*  You think he's winning? Yeah. Interesting. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5623.24s)]
*  What do you guys think? [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5625.24s)]
*  I think I'm riding with Dylan. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5627.24s)]
*  I think it goes to decision [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5629.24s)]
*  and I think Logan gets to own the decision. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5631.24s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5633.24s)]
*  I think he got in Logan's [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5635.24s)]
*  head so much where Logan is going to [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5637.24s)]
*  probably go some fury shit and then [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5639.24s)]
*  Dylan just catch him. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5641.24s)]
*  He'll get in close. They're only doing six rounds [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5643.24s)]
*  though, right? They're not doing eight. I think that's why [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5645.24s)]
*  Dylan is pushing for more rounds. I think [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5647.24s)]
*  Mark's assessment is right. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5649.24s)]
*  I think Logan wins the decision [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5651.24s)]
*  and I think there will be a lot [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5653.24s)]
*  of grabbing and a lot of [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5655.24s)]
*  holding. I don't think it will be a beautiful [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5657.24s)]
*  boxing match, but I don't know [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5659.24s)]
*  if Logan will be able to hurt him. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5661.24s)]
*  And I think that [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5663.24s)]
*  in the clinch, I think [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5665.24s)]
*  Dylan can really probably control him. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5667.24s)]
*  And [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5669.24s)]
*  I think what will happen is [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5671.24s)]
*  Logan will win the decision, but it will be kind of [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5673.24s)]
*  ugly. And I think that he'll lose the [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5675.24s)]
*  PR war the big. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5677.24s)]
*  You said you were supposed to knock him out. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5679.24s)]
*  You said you were going to do all these things and you couldn't even [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5681.24s)]
*  knock him out. I actually think Dylan's victory [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5683.24s)]
*  will be not getting knocked out. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5685.24s)]
*  And I don't think he's going to get knocked out. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5687.24s)]
*  I think Dylan's chin [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5689.24s)]
*  is good and I think his ability to withstand [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5691.24s)]
*  punishment is high. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5693.24s)]
*  There's also a chance he gets to disqualify [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5695.24s)]
*  because I think he's going to do something silly in the room. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5697.24s)]
*  I think that's equally [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5699.24s)]
*  likely. I think he's going to try to kick him. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5701.24s)]
*  He's going to lose on points if nothing else. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5703.24s)]
*  He's going to clinch him up and choke him out. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5705.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's one thing I [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5707.24s)]
*  don't think he cares about that. Because I kept bringing [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5709.24s)]
*  up you can't do that and he's like so? [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5711.24s)]
*  Yeah, I know. He kind of told us that. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5713.24s)]
*  I don't think he cares about a boxing [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5715.24s)]
*  match. I think he just cares about fighting [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5717.24s)]
*  Logan and being in the ring with him. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5719.24s)]
*  Now Logan said in their face to face [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5721.24s)]
*  that if Dylan shows up, he'll [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5723.24s)]
*  have an MMA fight. I saw that. They shook hands on that. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5725.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's a bad idea. I don't think he will. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5727.24s)]
*  Yeah, you can't, right? [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5729.24s)]
*  No, that's a bad idea. There'll be no debate [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5731.24s)]
*  on that one. Now if Logan knocks him out [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5733.24s)]
*  immediately, he can do it. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5735.24s)]
*  You have to get an actual KO. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5737.24s)]
*  Yeah, it has to be a KO. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5739.24s)]
*  And he can do it because he'll just be so [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5741.24s)]
*  confident. All I got to do is touch him. And now I got [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5743.24s)]
*  these little gloves. I'm going to touch him again. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5745.24s)]
*  But if it's a six [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5747.24s)]
*  round decision, [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5749.24s)]
*  you don't want to take that into MMA. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5751.24s)]
*  No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5753.24s)]
*  But still, I'm [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5755.24s)]
*  glad this fight is going to happen. I'm glad they're going to [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5757.24s)]
*  settle it. And I hope that Dylan [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5759.24s)]
*  stops suing him. I don't like this [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5761.24s)]
*  at all. Sorry, I hope [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5763.24s)]
*  Logan stops suing him. Or Nina stops suing him. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5765.24s)]
*  I hope they just settle it at the fight. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5767.24s)]
*  It's over, squash, done. I also hope [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5769.24s)]
*  Dylan drops all the shit with Nina. Yeah. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5771.24s)]
*  Yeah, which I don't know if he's mentioned [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5773.24s)]
*  anything else since. He has. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5775.24s)]
*  Today? Yeah. No, every morning. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5777.24s)]
*  Friday. Really? [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5779.24s)]
*  Wow. Just another pick. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5781.24s)]
*  Yeah, unnecessary. I think the last one [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5783.24s)]
*  I saw, it was like a [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5785.24s)]
*  Photoshop [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5787.24s)]
*  time call. He's behind [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5789.24s)]
*  Nina while Logan's on [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5791.24s)]
*  the call. Wow. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5793.24s)]
*  Wow. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5795.24s)]
*  I thought he has a thing. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5797.24s)]
*  Yeah, distasteful. Yeah. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5799.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5801.24s)]
*  Yeah, wow, it's interesting. I mean, [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5803.24s)]
*  here, he was just so likable on the episode [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5805.24s)]
*  and he was just so funny. And he didn't even have to barely [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5807.24s)]
*  bring it up once. Yeah. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5809.24s)]
*  Yeah. You hope that that [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5811.24s)]
*  sticks with him. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5813.24s)]
*  Didn't seem to. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5815.24s)]
*  It might be just such an easy button [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5817.24s)]
*  to go to and something that's so [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5819.24s)]
*  rewarded, but I'm sure he felt [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5821.24s)]
*  the reaction to the episode. Yeah. I mean, there's [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5823.24s)]
*  so many people that hit me up and they were just like, [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5825.24s)]
*  wow, you guys made [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5827.24s)]
*  me love Dylan Danis. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5829.24s)]
*  Right? Like, it was just crazy. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5831.24s)]
*  It was a funny episode, man. Yeah. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5833.24s)]
*  When he gets 10% vulnerable, he's [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5835.24s)]
*  100% more likable. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5837.24s)]
*  I'm excited to see them fight. We'll be [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5839.24s)]
*  out there. Yeah, y'all are going to be out there. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5841.24s)]
*  Yeah. So that'll be cool. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5843.24s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5845.24s)]
*  Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5847.24s)]
*  Fuck. I'm under pressure. Tommy [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5849.24s)]
*  and KSI. So interesting to [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5851.24s)]
*  see that fight. Overshadowed. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5853.24s)]
*  I don't even care about it. OK, like, do you make [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5855.24s)]
*  Logan and Dylan the main event? [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5857.24s)]
*  Like, after that Logan-Dylan [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5859.24s)]
*  fight, I know we're in [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5861.24s)]
*  England and, like, obviously these are [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5863.24s)]
*  huge superstars in England. Fair [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5865.24s)]
*  enough. So they're going to obviously [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5867.24s)]
*  care about their beef, but this is, like, I think [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5869.24s)]
*  Dylan and Logan is, like, global. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5871.24s)]
*  Yeah. Like, my interest in [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5873.24s)]
*  the card dissipates after [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5875.24s)]
*  Dylan and Logan. And I like [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5877.24s)]
*  KSI. And I actually kind of like [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5879.24s)]
*  Tommy. Yeah. Seems like a good guy. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5881.24s)]
*  Um. Does KSI [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5883.24s)]
*  have any chance on that one? [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5885.24s)]
*  I don't know boxing, but I don't see it. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5887.24s)]
*  Bro, the kid hits hard. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5889.24s)]
*  That's what I hear. Yeah. But [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5891.24s)]
*  I think it's hard to hit a [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5893.24s)]
*  guy who's boxing since they were a kid. Yeah. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5895.24s)]
*  Even if Tommy Fury's not an elite boxer, [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5897.24s)]
*  like, he's not fucking Terrence, [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5899.24s)]
*  you know, Bud Crawford. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5901.24s)]
*  He's still someone who's been in the ring [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5903.24s)]
*  with people that are really good at throwing their hands. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5905.24s)]
*  Yeah. And that kind of experience helps [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5907.24s)]
*  when you're up against, for example, Jake. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5909.24s)]
*  He, Tommy just looked more experienced. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5911.24s)]
*  He's just flying in it. Yeah. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5913.24s)]
*  So he understood what Jake was doing, [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5915.24s)]
*  was able to protect himself from it. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5917.24s)]
*  I mean, to give Jake credit, Jake dropped him [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5919.24s)]
*  still. Yeah. And it wasn't, [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5921.24s)]
*  it was a close fight, but you can make the argument [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5923.24s)]
*  there's no way KSI is able to put [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5925.24s)]
*  the time in a box that Jake does. Yeah. That's all [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5927.24s)]
*  KSI's got 50 fucking shows going on, [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5929.24s)]
*  charity events, [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5931.24s)]
*  you know, the dating thing that they do. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5933.24s)]
*  It's like, how could you [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5935.24s)]
*  do all that and focus on boxing? [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5937.24s)]
*  Do you think being so unorthodox [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5939.24s)]
*  or whatever would help him as a boxer? [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5941.24s)]
*  It will help in the beginning. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5943.24s)]
*  It will absolutely help in the beginning. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5945.24s)]
*  Because Tommy's not going to know how to deal with [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5947.24s)]
*  like the way the punches are thrown. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5949.24s)]
*  You're a traditional boxer. You're used to other traditional boxers. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5951.24s)]
*  So it will help in the beginning, but usually [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5953.24s)]
*  what happens is as you get tired [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5955.24s)]
*  and the other people start to see [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5957.24s)]
*  what you do that's unorthodox, [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5959.24s)]
*  you're unorthodox, but it's repetitive. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5961.24s)]
*  And once [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5963.24s)]
*  you see the holes in that style, [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5965.24s)]
*  you get a lot easier to touch. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5967.24s)]
*  Yeah. So we'll see [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5969.24s)]
*  what happens. I mean, like, dude, imagine [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5971.24s)]
*  KSI beats Tommy. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5973.24s)]
*  I mean, what a fucking [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5975.24s)]
*  oh my God. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5977.24s)]
*  Imagine he knocks out Tommy. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5979.24s)]
*  Like, [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5981.24s)]
*  that Jake KSI fight. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5983.24s)]
*  Huge. Explodes. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5985.24s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5987.24s)]
*  what the fuck? [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5989.24s)]
*  Imagine Dylan [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5991.24s)]
*  beats Logan. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5993.24s)]
*  Jake Dylan. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5995.24s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5997.24s)]
*  And Dylan doesn't even have to take it if he doesn't want to. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=5999.24s)]
*  He can say, I won, [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6001.24s)]
*  you come fight me in MMA. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6003.24s)]
*  Oh shit. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6005.24s)]
*  And Jake might do it. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6007.24s)]
*  Yeah. Well, yeah. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6009.24s)]
*  I mean, he would take his KSI bag first. He would [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6011.24s)]
*  fight Tommy again and then maybe. I mean, [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6013.24s)]
*  what a fucking weekend. Well, Jake got [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6015.24s)]
*  a few good bags coming to him either way, seems like. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6017.24s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6019.24s)]
*  Yeah. Wow. It's weird. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6021.24s)]
*  It's almost like the pressure is really on [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6023.24s)]
*  Logan here. Oh, yeah. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6025.24s)]
*  Way more. Dylan's got nothing to lose. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6027.24s)]
*  If Logan wins in dominant fashion, [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6029.24s)]
*  it's really interesting to see how, like, [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6031.24s)]
*  the internet will adjust. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6033.24s)]
*  It's hard to not respect [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6035.24s)]
*  somebody knocking someone out. Yeah. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6037.24s)]
*  So he'll have all [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6039.24s)]
*  these people that are really invested [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6041.24s)]
*  in his, you know, downfall. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6043.24s)]
*  But then they see you knock [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6045.24s)]
*  another human being out and then they go, [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6047.24s)]
*  well, I got to respect [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6049.24s)]
*  that at least. They might not verbalize it, but [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6051.24s)]
*  they'll say, OK, [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6053.24s)]
*  I can't hate on the fact that you just [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6055.24s)]
*  concussed another human being. Yeah. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6057.24s)]
*  There's a primal respect for it. The mental battle [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6059.24s)]
*  for Logan will be higher than the technical battle, [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6061.24s)]
*  I think. 100. Yeah. I think Logan is [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6063.24s)]
*  more technically better boxer than Dylan. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6065.24s)]
*  But the mental challenge he's up against [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6067.24s)]
*  with, like, OK, my girl's on the line. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6069.24s)]
*  Like, not literally, but, like, in the [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6071.24s)]
*  eyes of the public, my reputation. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6073.24s)]
*  Also, you didn't think he was going to [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6075.24s)]
*  show up. Yeah. Like, what's going through Logan's [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6077.24s)]
*  brain right now? This whole camp, he was like, [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6079.24s)]
*  he's not really going to show up. Yeah. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6081.24s)]
*  Now he's there. What the fuck [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6083.24s)]
*  are you thinking? You've been planning for Mike [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6085.24s)]
*  Perry and him. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6087.24s)]
*  Now you have to adjust to the fact that [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6089.24s)]
*  this fight is real. Yeah. Yeah. Whoa. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6091.24s)]
*  So [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6093.24s)]
*  that would be impressive. Yeah. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6095.24s)]
*  To see Logan push through that would be interesting. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6097.24s)]
*  I just didn't see, like, [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6099.24s)]
*  like you said it, Jake has [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6101.24s)]
*  like knockout power. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6103.24s)]
*  And that's something you're born with. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6105.24s)]
*  I don't know that Logan has that. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6107.24s)]
*  And without that, either you went on points, which is [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6109.24s)]
*  kind of a loss for you, or [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6111.24s)]
*  Dylan gets it. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6113.24s)]
*  Because Dylan's not going down [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6115.24s)]
*  unless you can land a fucking shot, [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6117.24s)]
*  dude. You saw that guy's head. It was crazy. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6119.24s)]
*  I do think he will disqualify himself with [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6121.24s)]
*  that. Like, doing dumb [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6123.24s)]
*  shit, he'll lose points and then lose on points. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6125.24s)]
*  Which I hope he doesn't do. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6127.24s)]
*  Just fucking, come on. Yeah. Finish [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6129.24s)]
*  the fight. Yeah. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoR9sFJna0g&t=6131.24s)]
