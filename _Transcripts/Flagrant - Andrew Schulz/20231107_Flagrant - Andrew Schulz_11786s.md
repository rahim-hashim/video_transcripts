**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [November 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg)
*  I remember when I first started comedy, my dream was to one day headline Mass in the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=0.0s)]
*  Square Garden and I would tell people that and they would all usually roll their eyes [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  or they would like they kind of laugh at the notion of it. I told you that that was my dream. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11.84s)]
*  Why? I said one day I want to headline Mass in the Square Garden and I remember you saw what [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=17.2s)]
*  you were doing and you looked me in the eyes and you said I'll see you there. And it was like [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=20.88s)]
*  really important to me because I felt like I wasn't the only person that believed it could happen. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=26.32s)]
*  Wow. And I know as you get older you know sometimes things will come hard to remember [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=32.8s)]
*  but I remember everything. I remember all the time you put into me and then all the effort [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=41.2s)]
*  that you made and how much you always believed in me and supported me and this made all the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=47.04s)]
*  difference. Absolutely. Yeah so the reason I brought you here is [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=51.44s)]
*  yeah I want to say thank you for being the most amazing dad ever and the other reason I want to [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=58.8s)]
*  bring you here is because I want to let you know that when my tour comes to New York [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=62.96s)]
*  I'm going to be headlining Mass in the Square Garden. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=68.72s)]

*  but like my after my mom gave birth to me my dad took off. My mom went back to work. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=146.24s)]
*  So like for the first six months it was just like me and him. Yeah. Yeah. That's awesome. So I [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=153.68s)]
*  probably would like my mom if it didn't go that way. She's the reason you hustled. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=160.48s)]
*  I love my mom so much. She's amazing and congrats on becoming a U.S. citizen mom. That was incredible [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=170.16s)]

*  so maybe it's more for me to get them out to him like at least I know that I've said it to him. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=190.72s)]
*  I've said it to him every single time I see him but like it's there and he can watch it anytime [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=196.0s)]
*  he wants to or my mom can play it for him and but yeah like 40 years never took a day off man. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=199.83999999999997s)]

*  If your suits are anything like your clothes you were the first in the Steve Harvey suits. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=305.68s)]
*  Oh yeah. I look like a caterer with some baggy ass clothes. Yeah it was uh yeah it's weird my [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=309.12s)]
*  dad had no rules really growing up. There was like very few things you know apologize when you do [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=316.08s)]
*  something wrong uh do your homework and that was pretty much it and then one of them was just like [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=320.32s)]
*  hey if we go here. You didn't really listen to either one of those. I did but I'm one for three. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=325.76s)]

*  the garden? Like of course. Yeah it's just I feel that way and I'm not even in New York I can't even [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=356.08s)]
*  imagine. Yeah yeah I mean I prefer the Amway arena in Orlando. I think that that was more special. Not [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=360.08s)]
*  even bullshitting dude the American Airlines Center in Dallas doesn't mean as much to me as the garden. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=365.84s)]
*  The garden is the fuck it's the mecca they call it the mecca. Yeah and I can't even imagine and no [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=370.0s)]

*  it could be for 30 minutes but I think about it and I think it just all just smacked me in my face [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=426.47999999999996s)]

*  But yeah it's your Izzy moment. I hope you can all experience this feeling one time. Yeah I genuinely hope. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=564.8s)]
*  Yeah and I can't wait for you guys too and it's going to be awesome and I'm going to sit there with you while you guys are crying [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=570.56s)]
*  and it's going to be great. It's going to be fucking great. Anyway let's get to the episode. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=576.0s)]
*  We literally got one of my childhood heroes and someone I've looked up to. I think we've all you know [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=580.96s)]
*  grown up watching basketball. This guy's an absolute legend and he's as great as you think he is. Bro [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=585.84s)]
*  it is so nice to admire somebody and meet them and then they exceed the expectations. I told him that [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=591.44s)]
*  this is a hero I'm glad I met which doesn't happen often. Facts. So enjoy the one and only [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=598.16s)]
*  the white chocolate Jason Williams. He was telling us about the technical in China. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=603.12s)]
*  The dude is their coach is like the national team coach or he might be the leader of their [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=608.24s)]
*  army or some shit. Early in the game they're probably gonna call offensive foul. Sure enough [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=611.84s)]
*  refs is cheating. As soon as they call offensive foul my dumb ass boots this ball. Commotion [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=616.64s)]
*  blowing up. Next thing you know the ball is right back in my hand. What do I do? Kind of kick further than [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=620.32s)]
*  they think I was bullshitting like. Now I'm kicked out of the game. This is a charity game? Yeah. Next [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=625.6s)]
*  thing you know the ball's for China. Whoever that is. Talk to the refs. I think they end up [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=630.08s)]
*  letting me play in the second half. I was fearful that they were gonna take my passport. Yeah you [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=635.36s)]
*  could get locked up. Last place you want to be locked up in China I think. What do you think [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=638.8000000000001s)]
*  would happen? Fill you up with duck sauce? Well I'm not. I'm not. Biddy Clarkson was fast as hell. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=642.0s)]
*  Like I'm on a gold tooth bro. It didn't matter I was quick as a hiccup. I was high as a giraffe. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=647.36s)]
*  Which is a dish in China. China for me is like a seven day tops. What happens after that? I start to die. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=652.0s)]
*  What's up everybody? Welcome to Flavor. Today I'm incredibly excited because we have [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=660.1600000000001s)]
*  Belle West Virginia's finest. We have quite possibly the greatest passer in the history of the NBA. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=666.96s)]
*  And the greatest quarterback Randy Moss has ever played for. We got Jason Williams. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=674.0s)]
*  Let's go baby. We got Jason Williams. I appreciate that. I'm gonna say I'm gonna be a close second to Tom Brady bro. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=679.5200000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna give Tom Brady the nod. You're so humble. He's got too many rings bro not to [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=688.1600000000001s)]
*  give him the credit right? Now I have to like clear up some folklore about you. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=692.72s)]
*  All right. Okay. Folklore might be hard to clear up. Okay exactly. It could be complete you know [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=697.44s)]
*  fairy tales. It could be real stuff. But throughout history obviously I've been watching since I'm a [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=703.44s)]
*  kid. I literally went to go see you play the Nets. My dad got tickets. I remember going to see you [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=708.08s)]
*  play the Nets. And for a New Yorker to go to Jersey. That's a big deal. Mixed fan. Life long. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=713.44s)]
*  That's like taking a flight almost. Wow. Yeah. And yeah. It is. This is big. So and you only scored [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=717.44s)]
*  six points which is really annoying. We made a big trip for six points. But listen. I scored. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=726.32s)]
*  Okay. Is this true? You used to do drive-by paintball shootings of Chris Webber's home [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=733.7600000000001s)]
*  in Sacramento. I'm gonna play the fifth. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=742.0s)]
*  His house probably caught some bullets along the way. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=752.16s)]
*  That's the most country ass white boy drive-by you could possibly do. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=757.2s)]
*  You know what I mean? And he was probably with me on some of them drive-bys. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=761.6s)]
*  I was just trying to get family members out of there. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=764.8s)]
*  I got a good story about it. We were doing that one time. The security guard at the [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=768.0s)]
*  Los Lagos in Sacramento. Granite Bay. Shout out. We had a good time there. Other than this one [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=772.0799999999999s)]
*  incident. So we couldn't get in the gate or something. So we decided we're gonna go down [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=776.64s)]
*  and do our thing at the security guard at night. Right? So we got these two little scooters. We're [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=780.0799999999999s)]
*  riding on these scooters. We dropped them over there in the dark. And we're walking through the [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=786.48s)]
*  woods and whatever. We got the paintballs and we got rocks. Boom, boom. We did it. And here we go [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=789.92s)]
*  take off. We left the scooters. See Webb's shoe falls off. And we get there and we stop. And I'm [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=793.92s)]
*  like, bro, where's your shoe? He said it fell off. I said, you gotta go get it. You're the only [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=799.1999999999999s)]
*  motherfucker in here to wear the size. But we got away with it. Nobody got in trouble. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=803.68s)]
*  This is rookie year? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=809.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, rookie year. Yeah. That was the most fun time I think because it was a blessing in disguise [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=810.88s)]
*  because it was the lockout season. We only played 50 games. So we would play Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=816.9599999999999s)]
*  in three different time zones. And we really didn't have any time for practice or anything [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=822.96s)]
*  like that. So what I say is a blessing in disguise. I really didn't learn much. It was just [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=827.0400000000001s)]
*  coaches threw me out there and I got to do what I got to do. So like I said, a blessing in disguise. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=831.52s)]
*  I have fun. I wouldn't change it for the world though. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=836.32s)]
*  Okay. Second piece of folklore. When you're still playing some rec league ball, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=839.2800000000001s)]
*  there's a play that you call called Calling Blue. What is Calling Blue? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=845.6800000000001s)]
*  Man, Blue, I don't think Blue will work in too many men's leagues without fights. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=850.8s)]
*  For instance, if most of the men's leagues that I played in, I had a pretty good team. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=856.8s)]
*  I mean, I knew what I was doing a little bit. But I'd always keep two shooters with me and [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=862.16s)]
*  some athlete to play D or whatever. I mean, guys would guard me. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=866.64s)]
*  You refused to play D. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=870.0s)]
*  Two shooters with me too. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=870.9599999999999s)]
*  There you go. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=871.76s)]
*  So if we get up by like 50 or 60 and other teams still talking shit or whatnot, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=872.24s)]
*  we're going to call Blue. And Blue, what Blue is, as soon as they score, you bring the ball in. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=882.48s)]
*  You're on my team. You throw it right to me in the corner. I'm shooting a three in their bucket. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=887.36s)]
*  So he's scoring on his own. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=890.5600000000001s)]
*  If I call Blue, we're scoring for the other team. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=892.8s)]
*  Why? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=895.92s)]
*  Just because they're talking shit and we're already up 60. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=896.64s)]
*  You still can't beat it. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=899.2s)]
*  Level of disrespect. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=901.5200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=902.8000000000001s)]
*  Now, is it true? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=903.36s)]
*  Totally. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=904.32s)]
*  Is it true you once got fouled while shooting on your own basket? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=905.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that was like, I think that was before Blue even was created. But [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=910.8000000000001s)]
*  I remember like it was yesterday, my agent was in town. This was like a rec league and a men's league. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=915.6s)]
*  And I told my agent, I said, look, I'm going to give you the other team. I'm going to give [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=922.48s)]
*  you the other team the spread 72. We're all playing two 20 minute halves running clock, right? So [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=925.36s)]
*  we got to beat them by 72. I look over, there's like six minutes left and we're up by like, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=932.88s)]
*  I want to say 86, something like that. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=937.92s)]
*  We start shooting. I start shooting. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=943.68s)]
*  Well, it only happens if the other team's talking shit. If the other team just takes the ass whooping [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=948.16s)]
*  and goes on about their business, we'll be fine. This will be by them. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=952.0s)]
*  How much will you beat them by then? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=953.8399999999999s)]
*  50. We'll try to be, it depends on what our team wants to do that night. We're just there to get, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=955.68s)]
*  I'm sorry. We're just there to get some conditioning. We call Blue when we're up. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=960.0s)]
*  Guys, we're not really taking this seriously. We're just trying to get some cardio in. So [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=966.88s)]
*  let's everybody be polite about this. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=970.0s)]
*  So I'm doing Blue and we're shooting on the other team's basket. And now the other team's kind of, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=972.56s)]
*  they're getting mad that I'm shooting. And like the third or fourth one, they come and try to [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=977.1999999999999s)]
*  play D and don't let me get the ball in bounds. So finally get it in, I'm dribbling up the court [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=980.56s)]
*  towards my basket. And I turned around real quick and shoot it back in their basket. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=984.64s)]
*  And Buddy fouled me. Well, the ball went in. Now I'm looking at the ref. What are you going to call [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=988.08s)]
*  him? I'm ready. And what? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=993.6s)]
*  That's right. So I'm like, what are you going to call? He's like, I don't really want to call. So [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=998.08s)]
*  he just comes over to me and says, Jason, cut the bullshit. So what I think is, what do y'all think [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1001.92s)]
*  should happen in that situation? I think you should free throw. Yeah, as a free throw. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1007.6s)]
*  Well, the bucket went in. Yeah. But on whose basket? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1010.08s)]
*  On their basket. You shoot the basket at their free throw. You should choose. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1012.96s)]
*  No, you got to shoot on your free throw. What I think happens is I think the three [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1016.16s)]
*  point counts for them. But you get to shoot a free throw. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1019.04s)]
*  Correct. On my basket. Because you're shooting. You're fouling the actor's shooting. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1021.52s)]
*  That's right. Like I don't know how people know, try to whoop my ass when I do something. If [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1025.2s)]
*  somebody did that to me, I'm firing. That never resulted in a fight? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1029.28s)]
*  Immediately. It never resulted in a fight. How many fights did you get in growing up? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1034.0s)]
*  Not really many, but because I was so much smaller than everybody, I really never talked [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1039.2s)]
*  shit to nobody like that. I kind of know when I can talk shit. 40 year old rec league. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1043.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, because I know who's with me or what. Randy Moss, not. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1051.44s)]
*  Who was your protector growing up? Because I assume that sometimes the game gets a little [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1056.6399999999999s)]
*  disrespectful. High school, there's rivalries. Well, in high school in West Virginia, we were [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1061.52s)]
*  just beating, we could have called blue in high school in West Virginia if we wanted to. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1067.28s)]
*  It was that dominant. Yeah, we were killing people then too. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1070.72s)]
*  So I guess for everybody who doesn't know, you go to high school with Randy, you guys both play [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1073.76s)]
*  football together, you both play basketball together, and Randy was incredible at basketball too. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1078.16s)]
*  He was. And you were incredible at football. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1082.56s)]
*  You win player of the year one year. Is Randy on the team? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1085.52s)]
*  Randy was on the team. Have you never let him live that down? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1088.8799999999999s)]
*  No, because he won player of the year in basketball one year too. So I mean, it's like [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1092.32s)]
*  fair is fair. Yeah, that's right. I wasn't a bad quarterback though. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1096.96s)]
*  But I didn't like to get hit. Yeah, I wasn't. I wasn't. And I couldn't remember the play like, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1100.48s)]
*  like I would call it playing a huddle. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1104.72s)]
*  I wonder why. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1110.0s)]
*  Hey, Randy, this is the play. Go long, Randy. That's the play. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1116.96s)]
*  So I would be in a huddle and I would call whatever like, let's just say 32 dive and then [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1121.76s)]
*  you got to get up to the line and say a cadence like as a quarterback like 4, 82, 4. If I said [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1125.92s)]
*  all that shit, I done forgot it was 32. So look, I'm calling 32 dive and on the first word you guys [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1131.8400000000001s)]
*  hear me say, that's when you hike the ball. The first sound you hear could be, hike that. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1140.48s)]
*  Any numbers involved? I don't know what we're going to do. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1148.0800000000002s)]
*  That's hilarious. But to your point, yeah, just throw it as far and as high as I could and Moss [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1150.4s)]
*  will go get it every time. So you would have a cannon you could throw it. I could throw it, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1155.28s)]
*  yeah, a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Moss was a good baseball player too though. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1158.32s)]
*  You keep saying, I was watching, you guys have a great, you have a great up in smoke interview. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1162.72s)]
*  Yeah, he could fish his ass off. That's right. You said he could be an NFL punter today. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1168.3999999999999s)]
*  For sure. Or a field goal kicker. Crazy. But fishing, why? That's what he likes to do. Like, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1173.2s)]
*  I like the golf he likes to fish. I don't get into that. I mean, you could go out there for [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1178.08s)]
*  six, seven hours and nothing happens. I mean, how much dope you going to smoke? How much beer [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1183.44s)]
*  you going to drink out there? So I don't know. I guess he goes into competitions and maybe in [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1189.8400000000001s)]
*  competitions they got like, they stocked the lake or whatever before. I don't know nothing about it, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1195.5200000000002s)]
*  bro. Why you just can't catch fish? I just, I don't want to touch the bait. And then if I do [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1199.7600000000002s)]
*  catch a fish, I don't want to touch that slimy something. What's up with your thing about like [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1204.0800000000002s)]
*  eating and then people touching your hands? I don't really like people touching me really. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1209.84s)]
*  Especially if I don't know you. Okay, for example. There's some parts of this world [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1220.3999999999999s)]
*  that you can go to and like, you know, God forbid, I'm thankful that people want to take their [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1225.12s)]
*  picture with me. I'm very thankful for that. But I don't get it when people are like, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1229.4399999999998s)]
*  can I get a picture? At least ask me first. You know what I mean? So stuff like that kind of makes [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1234.32s)]
*  me a little. Did something happen with the food? Because I've heard this story. I'm not sure. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1239.28s)]
*  I don't refresh my memory. I don't know. Like while you're eating, you don't like anybody [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1245.04s)]
*  touching your hands. Sharing food? I don't really like to share food either. I'm going, you know, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1248.8s)]
*  we're all big. I so, I so. Yeah, we're all big boys. Why we want to share some shrimp fried rice? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1255.36s)]
*  Just get your own bowl. Right? Am I wrong for that? That's completely right. And I'll gladly [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1258.8799999999999s)]
*  buy you that bowl too if you like it. Now, if somebody starts eating out of your shrimp fried [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1264.72s)]
*  rice. That's yours. So you can't go to a family style restaurant. So what happens when you're, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1268.64s)]
*  when you're playing on, when you're playing on the Kings and you're with all these euros who are used [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1278.3200000000002s)]
*  to these like big collective meals, everybody eat together. They got the fucking Hanser and everything. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1283.0400000000002s)]
*  There's hummus. Everything's getting passed around. How are you handling all that? I'll keep that [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1288.3200000000002s)]
*  hummus over there. We don't, you know, all Europeans keep that over here. Us Americans, we're going to [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1292.48s)]
*  wings and all. We're going to have this shit over here. You know what I mean? Like Europeans are a lot [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1297.4399999999998s)]
*  different than Americans. I mean, God bless them. They can hoop, they can do all that stuff, but [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1301.36s)]
*  they're just, they just, this different, right? Yeah. Forskin. I mean, yeah. You know what I mean? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1308.0s)]
*  Long foreskin. That is true. That is true. You notice that. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1313.04s)]
*  And that was different for me. I'm from Belle, West Virginia, as you said earlier, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1320.2399999999998s)]
*  there's no foreskins in Belle. Not one. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1324.16s)]
*  You know what, man? I'm going to say the same. Doug Christie. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1332.56s)]
*  That's my guy. Doug Christie. Oh, it's a great guy. I think he got a bad rap, bro. He's just, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1338.0s)]
*  he wanted to win, bro. Why do you get a bad rap? I think because he loved his wife so much in an [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1342.4s)]
*  NBA circle. People don't dig that. Yeah. That did kind of define him. It did. But, but bro, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1346.72s)]
*  Doug Christie and his wife are two of the greatest people you ever meet, bro. And he played D and [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1352.16s)]
*  that was, you didn't want to do that. So you love that. I didn't get paid to play D. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1355.6000000000001s)]
*  I love your animosity towards defense. Bro, okay. But defense, defense, I'm not a, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1367.6000000000001s)]
*  defense doesn't win championships for me. For you. Yeah. Like you got a score to win, right? Yeah. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1373.92s)]
*  Like I say all the time, you want five Ben Wallace's or five Allen Iversons. Five AIs. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1380.32s)]
*  Who's winning that game? Five AIs. Right, bro. So defense helps though. Yeah. I don't remember [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1385.6799999999998s)]
*  who. I think Stephen Jackson said in all the smoke, five Ben Wallace's would end up winning [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1389.6799999999998s)]
*  that game just out of sheer physicality. They just beat the shit out of him. No, I think he, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1392.8s)]
*  I think he folded on that. They're going to foul out. Ben Wallace is going to foul out. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1395.2s)]
*  I mean, there's nobody's going to stop AI one-on-one. Especially Ben Wallace. Yeah. And then they get [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1398.8799999999999s)]
*  frustrated and then they start fouling him. Right. And you know what else? People don't realize, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1404.32s)]
*  now I'm guarding Allen Iverson. He gets by me and now the big guy has to come and help [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1408.0s)]
*  my big guy defensively. And he either gets in foul trouble or AI dumps it off to his man. Now [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1413.12s)]
*  he's got 32 at the end of the night. And now the big guy's looking at, or everybody's looking at [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1418.0s)]
*  the big guy. Like your guy scored 32. What the hell? Hypothetical, hypothetical. That does make a [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1421.04s)]
*  lot of sense. But in reality, the defensive teams do tend to win the championships. Like if you're [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1426.08s)]
*  not good at defense, you're not winning most likely. Even Golden State had to get good at defense. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1430.56s)]
*  Without Draymond, that team folds. Right. Well, without Steph Curry and [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1434.96s)]
*  Clay Thompson's three pointers, where is that team? That's true. But you gotta, you know, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1439.76s)]
*  you gotta play defense. Defense helps. You actually, I'm a max point. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1443.92s)]
*  Defense helps. I'm a max point. That's why we hire people to do that. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1447.2s)]
*  The reason y'all beat us, the team that I rooted for in 06 was the defense. They couldn't handle [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1450.96s)]
*  the defensive pressure, I think, watching it. That was part of it. But Avery Johnson, they called [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1455.6000000000001s)]
*  a timeout in between free throws too, and then they couldn't advance the ball. So people don't [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1460.08s)]
*  realize that either. You remember that? Of course it was late in the game. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1463.84s)]
*  And not a single play behind center? You remember every backflip? [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1467.6s)]
*  I remember all the way. You can't remember 32 dives? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1473.6799999999998s)]
*  That's a lot of numbers, bro. Yeah, and then I gotta go 782. No, I can't do that. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1475.9199999999998s)]
*  Can't do it, dude. Okay, okay, okay. Let's start. Let's go back from the beginning, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1482.0s)]
*  because I don't think people know enough about how tumultuous the beginning of your career is. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1485.4399999999998s)]
*  So high school, incredibly fun. You guys are doing whatever the fuck you want. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1492.6399999999999s)]
*  Games sold out, people coming through. It's like crazy, like celebrity type stuff in town. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1495.84s)]
*  Town is small, but even extended town. Everybody knows you in the region. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1500.96s)]
*  Oh yeah, for sure. State championship. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1504.8s)]
*  If you don't get to the JV game before the JV game starts, you're not getting to watch our game [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1506.48s)]
*  that night. They would have to go to the JV game, sit through the whole JV game. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1510.48s)]
*  Do you start to experience fame a little bit then? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1517.2s)]
*  No, not really. Okay, because these are all your friends, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1519.84s)]
*  kids, folks you grew up with. All 17 of us. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1522.72s)]
*  Right. Yeah. A thousand people in the town, so everybody knows each other. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1525.52s)]
*  Maybe. Yeah, okay. You get an offer to play for Donovan at Providence. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1528.48s)]
*  Donovan wasn't at Providence yet. It was Rick Barnes at Providence. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1535.1999999999998s)]
*  Oh, Rick Barnes, okay. Then what happens where you end up going to Marshall? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1538.24s)]
*  Okay. Kentucky was recruiting me a little bit when I was a senior. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1542.8s)]
*  Billy Donovan was an assistant coach at Kentucky. So he liked you. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1546.88s)]
*  He saw you. He was the one [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1550.0s)]
*  recruiting me, right? So he brought me into summer camp down there at Kentucky, Patino's, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1550.88s)]
*  so Patino could see me. Push come to shove, Patino needed a freshman to play major minutes, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1555.44s)]
*  and he didn't think I was ready. So they recruited elsewhere. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1561.3600000000001s)]
*  And Billy Donovan, over that same time period, took a job at Marshall. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1565.7600000000002s)]
*  I would have never thought about going to Marshall. It was like 40 minutes from my house. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1569.6000000000001s)]
*  Just never thought about going there until he took the job. So I signed with Providence out of [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1574.0s)]
*  college with Rick Barnes. He took the job at Clemson. That's right. He leaves. So now, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1579.28s)]
*  because you like Rick Barnes. It wasn't the school. You believed in the coach who believed in you. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1585.28s)]
*  Let's get this never to school. It's the coach. Of course. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1588.48s)]
*  That's the recruiting process. Come on, man. Name an athlete that's ever been drafted, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1591.6000000000001s)]
*  that's been on the interview ever, that said, man, I went to such and such because they had [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1596.48s)]
*  a great biology professor. There might be an institution like Duke or something, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1601.52s)]
*  but still you're coming there for Coach K. Correct. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1610.08s)]
*  Okay. So he leaves. Now you're like, I don't want to play for this coach. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1614.24s)]
*  And did the coach fit? So what is his name? Rick Barnes leaves. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1618.48s)]
*  Rick Barnes left. Pete Gillen, God rest his soul. He came in. He and I had a relationship, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1622.08s)]
*  but he wanted to bring in, he brought in God, Cham God. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1628.4s)]
*  That's what I was going to ask. Yes. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1631.2800000000002s)]
*  Okay. Okay. Yes. So who's actually, I think now with the Mavs. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1632.72s)]
*  He is. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I didn't want to go that far away from home. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1636.0s)]
*  You know, probably not going to play, right? Yeah. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1640.72s)]
*  I mean, I probably, probably could have still went there and took the minutes, but I decided not to. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1642.8000000000002s)]
*  It's kind of funny though, because you'd be like, coach, don't you want something with handles? And [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1647.92s)]
*  he's like, well, yeah, well, maybe a white guy would handle. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1650.88s)]
*  Yeah. But yeah. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1655.36s)]
*  Were they offering you any brown paper bags? No, I wasn't. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1657.84s)]
*  Yeah. What is that? I wasn't in nowhere. Raiders four star. I didn't get any of that. So no. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1662.8s)]
*  Are they schmoozing your parents? No, no. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1669.36s)]
*  How did they even get in touch with you? Later on, they schmooze my parents. When I went to, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1672.8s)]
*  end up signing with, I had to sit out a year because I've already signed a letter with [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1678.24s)]
*  Providence. So I went to Fort Cunha Military Academy in Virginia and I was there for like [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1681.84s)]
*  eight days. That shit there, boy. Defense. It was too much, literally. It's defense. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1686.32s)]
*  Didn't even make it to basketball. No, I told my dad, no, I can't. No, eight days after this, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1694.48s)]
*  you got to salute like sixth graders that's been there longer with more rank than you. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1700.3999999999999s)]
*  You got to make your bet. I mean, not that I'm against all that shit, but you don't have no TV [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1704.8799999999999s)]
*  in your room. No, I'm not. On like the third day of class, English class, we got like a quiz [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1708.48s)]
*  with like 325 vocab words. I'm not cut out for this. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1713.1200000000001s)]
*  So then I sat out the rest of that semester and I went to talk with Billy Donovan up at Marshall. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1720.64s)]
*  So I sat out a year at Marshall. Randy was there too, right? Randy came after me. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1725.2s)]
*  So I was at Marshall, sat out a year, then I played a year and then Billy Donovan left [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1729.84s)]
*  and went to Florida. Now, does he tell you before? No, not really. He's like, I'm like, well, shit. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1732.8s)]
*  He's like, what are you going to do? I'm like, well, the only reason I came here, you know, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1738.24s)]
*  it's because of you, right? And he's like, well, I want you to stay here. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1741.2s)]
*  Looking back, that's what he was supposed to say. Meanwhile, I ended up at Florida. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1744.8s)]
*  Now people don't know. Now you don't have to do this, but back in the day, if you were going to [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1750.24s)]
*  change schools, you have to sit out another year. So you already registered freshman your first year, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1754.0s)]
*  right? So that's 18 to 19 is sat out. Now you're sitting out another year. So two years, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1760.0s)]
*  it's not eligibility because you maintain, but it's still of your life. Those are playing years. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1766.48s)]
*  Yeah. Actually, I played a year after I sat out a year and then I play the year. You played in [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1771.36s)]
*  Marshall. Correct. And then you have to sit out again. That's right. And it was illegal to pay. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1775.76s)]
*  So you're just sitting there. I'm saying two out of your, what would be four college years, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1779.52s)]
*  you have to sit out. Yeah. It's, I mean, it's just kind of crazy. Now I think players have a [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1784.0s)]
*  different perspective on it because now they're like, let me get into the league as soon as [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1789.36s)]
*  possible because let me get paid as soon as possible. Right. But you're essentially doing [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1791.76s)]
*  four years of college while only playing two. Right. That takes away two of your playing years. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1795.2s)]
*  That's big money you could be making anyway. So he says you should stay here. Right. And is [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1800.4s)]
*  that a political move by him? I think so. Looking back, I didn't know that then. Explain that because [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1806.24s)]
*  I don't understand. I just think maybe he was just trying to say the right thing for me because he [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1810.88s)]
*  knew that he couldn't come out and say, you come with me. Right. Cause I think back then you're [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1814.96s)]
*  probably getting in trouble for taking players. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Cause it's about the education. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1818.64s)]
*  Right. That's right. That good biology professor. Yeah. That's right, bro. Okay. So, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1824.0s)]
*  so the new coach came into Marshall. Yeah. He starts sending me a bunch of Reebok gear to the [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1829.44s)]
*  house thinking, thinking if I open that now he's got me. Cause it was like, he's almost like he's [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1833.6s)]
*  paying me now. I'm stuck here, but my dad was kind of smart about it. He didn't let me open any of [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1838.16s)]
*  it. I was mad and held my dad. I wanted to rock the gear. Right. So we had to end up hiring a [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1842.32s)]
*  lawyer and everything to get out of the commitment at Marshall to get to Florida. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1847.12s)]
*  Hmm. So do you call up Donovan and you say, Hey man, I want to, I want to come hoop for you. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1852.16s)]
*  I didn't personally, but, but yeah, he got, yeah. He got word. Yeah. And he wanted it. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1858.0800000000002s)]
*  I think so. But I mean, but then I get down there and he kicks me off the team after 17 games. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1862.88s)]
*  But you were hooping. I was hooping. But I did. He told me though, in all honesty, he told me that [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1867.92s)]
*  if I got, if I had another dirty test, he was going to kick me out. It was supposed to be three [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1872.88s)]
*  tests, but he only gave me two. But he told me after the first one, you know, he didn't have time [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1876.0800000000002s)]
*  for that. And like I said earlier, you know, getting paid and stuff like I wasn't that kind [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1879.52s)]
*  of guy. I wasn't getting, if I was getting, you know, if you're getting 30 and 15, that kind of [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1882.4s)]
*  stuff just slides right into the rug. I wasn't that kind of guy. Plus I wasn't going to class. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1886.32s)]
*  I'm in trouble. I mean, Billy Donovan's rule, if you didn't wait, if you didn't go to class, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1890.56s)]
*  you know, if you missed a class, you had to wake up the next day at 5 30 and run for, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1895.52s)]
*  for a half hour. I said, look here, I told the strings, cause I'm going to meet you every day [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1899.52s)]
*  at five. Cause look, it's a deal. That's right. Because you know what? I'm going to get in better [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1904.8s)]
*  shape than everybody and then I'm going to get a good breakfast and then I'm going to go sleep [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1912.32s)]
*  and I'm going to come to practice and bust everybody's ass in practice because I'm being [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1916.48s)]
*  better shaped and I'm ready to rock. So I thought that was probably another blessing and a curse [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1919.6s)]
*  for me to learn that I could miss class and just have to run for 30 minutes. I could run for 30 [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1925.6s)]
*  minutes all day. You know what I mean? Did you know it was one year and you're out? No, I didn't. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1930.0s)]
*  You know, once I got in trouble, I'm like, you know, everybody, what am I going to do this, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1935.12s)]
*  that and the other? And I always thought NBA or I don't know. Yeah. You know, now that I look back, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1939.12s)]
*  people ask me that question, what would I have done if I didn't play in the NBA? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1943.68s)]
*  Just my personality would be like, I can see myself, you know, I have fun, like I have fun [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1946.8s)]
*  being like a UPS driver, like a FedEx driver or something like that. Just give me my shit and let [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1951.84s)]
*  me go do my thing. I ain't trying to be around my boss all day or whatever, you know, telling me [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1956.8s)]
*  what I have to do. That's just my personality. Yeah. And you play like that too. There's a [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1960.3999999999999s)]
*  rebellious spirit in the game. Yeah. It's really interesting because you're the most humble dude [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1965.52s)]
*  that has been as famous as you've been, like truly humble. Yeah. But your game has no humility. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1971.12s)]
*  Well, I think that comes with the territory a little bit because as a little dude growing up [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1979.04s)]
*  I mean, let's keep it real. Most Hoopers are black dudes, right? Yeah. And athletic and big and strong, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1985.76s)]
*  way bigger and stronger than I was growing up, right? So you're not black. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1993.04s)]
*  I might have a half uncle down there somewhere, but like you said, I just go out and if you didn't [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=1999.6s)]
*  have that kind of attitude on the court, bro, I think you, a guy like me would just get ate up. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2008.0s)]
*  I think a lot of people confuse humility for a lack of confidence, but they're totally dissimilar [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2012.48s)]
*  because you were playing confident to the point where I feel like you were rejecting authority. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2018.48s)]
*  So like the coach might've wanted you to make the correct pass and do this. So I'm trying to [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2025.28s)]
*  understand where that confidence comes. And I've heard you say I've drilled these passes. I know [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2029.52s)]
*  it's going to go there every single time, but still when you're in a big game moment, we all have, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2033.84s)]
*  we haven't been to big games with you, but we all have this feeling like I don't want to do [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2039.2s)]
*  something that could let the team down, right? It doesn't even have to be a big game moment. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2042.48s)]
*  We're playing fucking paddle, whatever. Do I want to go for this slam and potentially lose the point [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2045.92s)]
*  for the team? You never even- No, because what if you didn't go for it and you didn't win [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2050.32s)]
*  and you're laying down in bed at night like, damn, I should have went for that shit. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2057.92s)]
*  We would have won. So the regret would eat you alive. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2061.68s)]
*  And plus like I've done tried all this shit. I practiced all this shit by myself and now I [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2064.16s)]
*  got these dudes around me, Chris Webber and Vlad D. Vox and Shaq and D Wade shit. I ain't got to [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2068.56s)]
*  be nowhere near perfect with my shit because these dudes are going to make me look great. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2075.6s)]
*  I think it gets twisted because I get a lot of credit for all this stuff, but without these dudes, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2079.04s)]
*  none of this, I wouldn't be sitting here today. I mean, some of these passes that I've thrown [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2084.24s)]
*  were horrible passes, but they caught these bitches and made them look good, bro. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2089.04s)]
*  So, and the elbow pass, I've did that thing probably millions of times and been successful [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2093.12s)]
*  three. I think the greatest mistake in Lamar Odom's life is fouling Rafe LaFrance on that. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2098.48s)]
*  I agree. But again, again, it's not crack. No, I'll take a little responsibility for that [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2105.04s)]
*  because if I'd have hit it to a bruh and he'd have been different. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2110.4s)]
*  No, no, no. He saw Rafe Trezzi like, God damn it. Give me Randy Moss. He'll take anyone. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2116.4s)]
*  He was probably a little more athletic than Dirk was, so I guess. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2123.28s)]
*  There it is. Guys, tour announcements. We have added a show in Portland. We sold out Friday and [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2125.92s)]

*  fucking tickets. I'm going to be honest with you. Those sales ain't shit. I'm not going to pretend [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2153.92s)]
*  they're great when they're not. Manchester's going to sell out. Y'all should buy tickets to Glasgow. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2156.96s)]
*  Get your fucking act together. Also, I announced this last week. This is big. January 6th, 8th, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2160.56s)]

*  at AkashSingh.com. Yeah, dude. Okay, okay, okay. So you're born in Florida. College game easy for you? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2178.56s)]
*  You feel like you could do whatever you want? I think basketball's kind of always been kind [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2186.08s)]
*  of easy to me. I mean, there's different levels to it, but I just feel like as a basketball player [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2189.28s)]
*  that's going to be playing the position that I played, when I get on the floor and I got the ball [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2193.92s)]
*  in my hand, I'm getting to anywhere. Wherever I want to go on the floor, I'm getting there. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2199.04s)]
*  That's yours. You ain't stopping me. It might take me a little bit longer in different situations, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2202.72s)]
*  but I'm going to get there. So just the confidence having that. So get on the floor. What does that [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2208.64s)]
*  mean I'm going to get there? For example? Like there ain't nothing you can do. Now I can't say [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2212.64s)]
*  that I'm going to score. I'm just saying like get to a spot on the floor where I'm going to get [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2216.56s)]
*  over here. And I know if you don't help off that corner, it's a layup for me. But if you take this [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2220.96s)]
*  lean this way, it's a three. Just lean. And that's all I'm really looking for. So [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2227.2s)]
*  the imagination, I think these kids, they don't have the imagination as today like they did back [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2233.6s)]
*  in the back when I grew up. And why is that? I think because a lot of these kids have trainers [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2238.8799999999997s)]
*  now and they walk in a gym and a trainer's already got a schedule. We're going to do ball handling [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2242.56s)]
*  for 15 minutes. All right, we're doing it. All right, now come on over here. We're going to do [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2247.52s)]
*  this. Whereas me, I never had a trainer. I would go in a gym and work on different types of pivots. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2250.0s)]
*  If you saw me working out, what is he doing? But I don't try these pivots just in case I get [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2258.16s)]
*  caught a half court somewhere trapped. And I got to use one of these crazy ass pivots just to get [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2262.72s)]
*  out of that. I know that I'm going to be able to do it, but it might look like shit, but it's going [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2267.04s)]
*  to work. So my point is to imagine, I got that. I've got this pivot. I got that pivot. Whereas [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2273.68s)]
*  a trainer's only going to work on X, Y, and Z. I have a question about the past and the way you [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2279.7599999999998s)]
*  passed. I know you said the way to stay on the court growing up, mainly playing with black dudes, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2285.28s)]
*  is I'll pass and I'll respect the passing. Is part of that why flashy passes, people are going to be [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2289.6000000000004s)]
*  like, oh, that white guy is cold with the passing. Is that where that comes from, you think, on any [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2295.92s)]
*  level of like, that's just what kept me on the court when I was a kid? I'm not sure, man, but it [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2299.76s)]
*  wasn't about that. That was keeping me on the court. I was thinking more along like, we're going [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2304.8s)]
*  to the park and you guys are there and you guys know how I play. I'm passing and y'all like to [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2308.88s)]
*  shoot. Well, shit, you're going to want me on your team all the time because I ain't shooting [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2312.96s)]
*  no balls. I'm trying to get y'all the balls. That's why I'm wondering if the NBA game was [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2316.0s)]
*  weirdly easier for you because you had more guys that could stroke. So in the college game, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2321.04s)]
*  I imagine you have to take on a little bit more of the offensive burden. You got to get the ball [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2327.68s)]
*  in a cup more. Whereas you start playing the league and it's like, wait a minute, I got four [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2331.76s)]
*  different dudes that are lights out. So did you find the transition to be a lot easier than [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2335.44s)]
*  people have maybe told you about? I mean, I want to say it was easier, but I don't want to sound [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2340.96s)]
*  like an asshole because the NBA is such, this is difficult because them dudes are monsters, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2345.04s)]
*  night in and night out. But yeah, the spacing is different. You know what I mean? Like I was kind [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2350.08s)]
*  of quick. If you weren't there when you're supposed to be, I'm going to get by you. So like I said [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2354.56s)]
*  earlier, if that guy's just leaning, you know what I mean? It's just a game of angles. That's the [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2359.2000000000003s)]
*  other thing. Okay. How often are you, because I think a lot of times we look at, or casual [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2363.36s)]
*  persons looking at basketball and they're like, okay, I see a guy open. I'm passing it to him. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2368.48s)]
*  What I think you would do and what would make it different was you would make guys open. And I [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2373.76s)]
*  think the elite passers do this. Something you were doing offensively is dragging attention away, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2378.32s)]
*  help away. And so you're setting up a pass while you still have the ball. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2384.64s)]
*  Are you thinking two moves ahead or are you in that moment going, okay, boom, done? [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2389.76s)]
*  Well, I'm definitely trying to think that way too, but sometimes it doesn't happen like that. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2394.9599999999996s)]
*  Most of the NBA is a pick and roll game, right? And the defense should be played the same if it's [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2402.56s)]
*  played the correct way. So the guys should be where they are. And as a point guard, you should know [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2407.12s)]
*  if I'm coming off a side pick and roll, well, this guy in the ball side corner defensively, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2412.3999999999996s)]
*  he's got to slide in there and take the role man on the pick and roll. And if he don't, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2417.68s)]
*  then that role man's a dunk, right? Because all the other three guys are on the side floor. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2422.4s)]
*  But now the pass that everybody wants to give up in the pick and roll defense is that guy slide in [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2425.92s)]
*  is the pass way back over there because all these guys in the NBA are quick enough to react to that [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2430.2400000000002s)]
*  where they're not quick enough to react to this little quick pass. Skip it all the time. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2435.44s)]
*  Funny story about the skip pass, Grant Long. Remember Grant Long used to play for the Atlanta [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2439.2000000000003s)]
*  Hawks? He played with me when, remember Ike Austin? Ike Austin with the Orlando Magic. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2442.48s)]
*  Yes, sir. Yeah. Well, anyway, we played together in Memphis. And it's my first year in Memphis. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2448.72s)]
*  And like a couple of timeouts combined, Grant Long was always in the corner of our offense. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2454.16s)]
*  Always. That's where you go the corner. No matter what's going on, Grant's in the corner, right? [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2459.2s)]
*  So it's like, oh, it's like two timeouts. He's bitching like, man, I'm open. I'm open in the [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2463.12s)]
*  corner. Y'all need to swing it. Y'all need to swing it. I'm getting fed up with this shit, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2466.8799999999997s)]
*  right? So like next time out, he's bitching again. I'm like, God damn it, Grant. It's the reason [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2471.2s)]
*  you're open in the corner. It's the reason, right? I'm like, look, if you want to shoot the ball, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2475.36s)]
*  you go offensive rebound. And every time you offensive rebound, you can shoot it any time [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2481.76s)]
*  you want. He never said he was open again. But I'm Phil Grant, because when I was in Miami, [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2485.04s)]
*  that was my job. I initiate the offense, bomb, get it to the D-Wayter, whoever, and go stand in [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2494.4s)]
*  the corner. And if I get it, shoot it, or if not, get your ass back on defense. Yeah. I mean, [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2498.48s)]
*  it's crazy the transition. Okay, okay. So you're whooping, you get in trouble for the weed. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2503.92s)]
*  I think it's weed. Did they ever fully say it was weed? Yeah. It's weed. Okay, so you get in trouble [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2510.08s)]
*  for the weed. Never did any other drugs than weed. Is that even a drug? Yeah. So funny. Right? [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2513.6s)]
*  How we treated it in the 90s, it was so funny. We thought that was the craziest thing. Bro, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2518.8s)]
*  nurse people locked up for life for it. Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah. Well, you got another advice, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2523.36s)]
*  too. You got a Coca-Cola. Yeah, Coca-Cola, but that's not really a vice, is it? This guy [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2526.8s)]
*  apparently drinks Coca-Cola breakfast, lunch, dinner. Are you a morning Coca-Cola guy? Coca-Cola [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2531.76s)]
*  guy? Come on, man, look, shout out to that, bro. They got you, bro. Coca-Cola at me, dog. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2536.5600000000004s)]
*  Okay, so you're balling, you get in a little bit of trouble. You're in flux right now, right? Are [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2544.88s)]
*  there teams in the league that are interested because they saw what you were doing? Or is there [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2551.36s)]
*  no interest and then the Nick Anderson play happens? Yeah, I don't know if there was any [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2556.32s)]
*  interest. I wasn't aware of any interest. Now, Billy Donovan never told me anything about that, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2560.16s)]
*  any interest. I'm sure there had to be some coaches calling and asking him something, right? [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2565.2s)]
*  I don't know, though. So I end up with Nick Anderson. We played a game before I got kicked [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2569.3599999999997s)]
*  off the team, Florida, Florida State in Orlando. Nick came to watch, blah, blah. He told his agent [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2574.8799999999997s)]
*  he needs to sign me. One thing, let him know that now I'm with Nick Anderson's agent. Nick Anderson, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2578.8799999999997s)]
*  basketball player, played for Orlando Magic, great shooter. First pick out of Orlando Magic ever [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2582.96s)]
*  for their franchise. I actually played in Sacramento with me too. But anyway, we signed with a [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2588.4s)]
*  save agent and he had a condo down in downtown Orlando. So when I got kicked off the team in [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2594.0s)]
*  Florida, I moved down there and that condo started working out with those guys down there. Best shape [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2599.2000000000003s)]
*  of my life. One thing led to another. The draft was coming up. I had to go work out for these [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2602.96s)]
*  different teams, different, different. I wasn't going to go work out. I think the Clippers have [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2607.1200000000003s)]
*  one. I'm not going to go work out for the Clippers because they're not picking me one. Who do they [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2611.6800000000003s)]
*  take? Oluwokandi or something? Oluwokandi, yes sir. Right. You should have worked out for the [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2615.76s)]
*  Clippers. Well, it was back when Donald Sterling owned the team, so I'm glad I did. So I worked [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2620.0800000000004s)]
*  out for these other teams and all these other guys that were supposed to be picked ahead of me, [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2626.1600000000003s)]
*  the Mike Bibbies, the Rafer Austens, the Tyrone Luebs. That's right. Rafer was in that draft [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2630.88s)]
*  class. That skipped to my Lueb. Yeah. A lot of times guys like that and myself will be at these [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2636.6400000000003s)]
*  workouts for these different franchises. But sometimes some guys would duck and dodge some [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2643.84s)]
*  workouts too, not in fear of hurting their- Because they don't want to go up against someone [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2648.96s)]
*  who's going to embarrass them. They're supposed to be low. Right. Right. So like I said, when I [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2653.1200000000003s)]
*  moved to Orlando, I got in the best shape of my life and I was going to all these workouts. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2656.6400000000003s)]
*  And you're already hooping with the Matt. You're playing with NBA players here. I could do this. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2661.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Doing this- Whatever you want it. Like I said, today if I go on the court, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2664.56s)]
*  I'm getting wherever I want to get. Against anybody? I might tear my Achilles, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2669.6800000000003s)]
*  but I'm going to get over it. Worth it. Yeah. So it's really just the body breaking down. You know- [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2673.52s)]
*  For sure. I mean, if you can dribble with your left and right hand as good as a lot of people can, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2678.8s)]
*  you can get to wherever you want, bro. I'm telling you. Okay. Okay. So take us through it. Take us [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2685.7599999999998s)]
*  through it. So I go through these draft workouts and I'm killing everywhere I go. Who are you going [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2690.08s)]
*  up against? Who's the one on ones? I never got to go against Bibbie. He didn't really work out. He [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2695.04s)]
*  worked out for the top two teams. That's it. Yeah. Because he knew what time it was. Yeah. But I [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2700.48s)]
*  worked out with, I think I worked out with Ray for somewhere in Tyrolu, Sacramento. We did that. They [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2705.04s)]
*  had me come back and work out again. So you have an initial one. Yeah. And they called and said, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2710.56s)]
*  can he stay the night and work out tomorrow? So what does that mean? Does that mean that [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2715.84s)]
*  they're unsure? Or does that mean they saw something they didn't know they were going to see? [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2719.2s)]
*  I personally think that they wanted to see if it was real. So they- Oh, he might have just had a [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2722.4s)]
*  great, he was on fire today. We got to make sure it's it. And you get that call. And what are you [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2726.88s)]
*  like? Are you like, this is food? Yeah. I think this is what's going to happen. They had the [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2732.1600000000003s)]
*  seventh pick, but then draft night comes and the Bucs had like six and Don Nelson calls my agent [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2736.08s)]
*  and talking about they might take me at the six. I didn't work out for the Bucs at all. I never had [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2742.1600000000003s)]
*  any conversation at all. So people were talking in the league. I think so. Oh, shit. So, but even [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2745.28s)]
*  if people were talking, if I was the owner or something, I wouldn't just go based off what he [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2752.0s)]
*  thought about you playing. If I was trying to get him and I knew what time it was with him, [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2755.92s)]
*  I'm not just going to pick you because you have some hoopla. You got to see it. You're right. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2759.36s)]
*  But still there's enough convo where they have to make a decision. Maybe. I think I made a little [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2762.64s)]
*  bit of noise too in a couple of these workouts. Do you remember which one was your best? [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2766.56s)]
*  Sacramento was for sure the best one. For sure. I mean, I was- [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2771.28s)]
*  Were you playing how you play? Full tilt. No way. Hold up. Hold up. We did this one- [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2775.6800000000003s)]
*  Oh, dude, the balls. So you don't even know if there's interest. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2781.36s)]
*  You go to these workouts thinking there might be and you're, oh, you have nothing to lose. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2785.04s)]
*  And plus that's all I know. I'm not going to go out there and just try to, eh, what's that going to- [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2789.28s)]
*  So you're toying with these motherfuckers and these coaches and the staff are looking at [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2794.2400000000002s)]
*  they're like, how is he playing so free? Why is he acting like this isn't the biggest deal in his [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2798.6400000000003s)]
*  life? And I wonder if the sports psychologists on the teams are going, yeah, this kid ain't scared. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2803.6000000000004s)]
*  Not scared of what? What are you going to do, bite me? [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2808.5600000000004s)]
*  But some players, some players- I agree. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2811.28s)]
*  Assholes get tight, bro. That's a big moment. That's your life right there, [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2812.8s)]
*  theoretically. Oh, every other person that's playing is like, I need to get the, I need to [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2815.52s)]
*  be drafted by this team. My whole life trajectory is built around this. I have this Adidas deal, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2818.96s)]
*  this Nike deal. And you're out there- I have no deal. I'm just trying to get in that uniform. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2822.7200000000003s)]
*  And you were eating them alive? Eat. Were you chirping at them? Were you talking shit? [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2827.28s)]
*  No, no, I wasn't chirping because like I said, I was small shit and I wasn't a chaperone. I [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2830.1600000000003s)]
*  wasn't a fighter either. You know what I mean? So you got five on the squad. Are you playing [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2834.72s)]
*  fives in these workouts? Like what is the- No, no, there was only, the one drill we did in [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2839.2799999999997s)]
*  Sacramento was, I forget, I forget who was there with me, but we did like a one-on-one drill. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2843.2s)]
*  And the width of the paint, that's out of bounds. So I started half court with a ball and I go at [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2848.56s)]
*  you. And if I score, now I'm coming back at the other guy at the other end. You go full court. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2854.8799999999997s)]
*  Out of bounds is the paint. You can't go out the width of the paint. But are you going full speed? [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2861.68s)]
*  I don't think anybody's stopping you full speed. Not anyone. So they just have to wait at the free [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2866.4s)]
*  throw line and you're going full speed at them? Yeah, and I got to do the same thing for them [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2871.04s)]
*  too. I mean, like I said earlier, I ain't playing no D, bro. I'm just trying to back up and entice [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2875.04s)]
*  a jump shot. But at some point, these guys, the coaches and all this, they ain't never want to [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2881.3599999999997s)]
*  see a jump shot. You got to do something. And so you were cooking them? Well, yeah, I was cooking. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2885.92s)]
*  I was just doing what I do. Like I said. And you're in the best shape of your life, [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2889.36s)]
*  so the full court's not bothering you. Not a bit, bro. Yeah. Not a bit. Okay, [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2892.56s)]
*  so Sack gets you with the seventh pick. Can you explain draft night? What does that feel like? [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2897.6s)]
*  You remember old boys in Orlando, the barbecue spot? Yeah. That's where I was the night of the [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2903.04s)]
*  draft. Really? You were at a barbecue restaurant? Yeah, thank you. You weren't at the draft? [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2907.04s)]
*  I was in Vancouver. That's right, because of the- [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2911.04s)]
*  Shout out to Vancouver. I love Vancouver. I went and visited to play the Grizzlies and things like [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2914.2400000000002s)]
*  that. Vancouver's a great city. But I wasn't going to go to the draft, not knowing that I was [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2917.76s)]
*  even going to get drafted. I'm sitting there, they got me on camera. In the second round, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2921.6000000000004s)]
*  I still ain't been drafted, right? Yeah. You got to old boys. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2924.8s)]
*  So I'm an old boy with my family, right? Go to a barbecue restaurant for draft night. It might [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2928.2400000000002s)]
*  be the most Jason Williams. Barbecue in Vancouver, no less. No, no, you couldn't go to Vancouver. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2933.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. So we're sitting there watching and the seventh pick comes up and, well, the sixth pick [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2940.5600000000004s)]
*  came up and that's when Don Nelson, the Bucks called my agent and said we might take him with [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2946.72s)]
*  the sixth pick. And they're like, why would you do that? Because I think we already knew [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2950.64s)]
*  the Sacramento was going to put us there at seven, we're going to take me. And once that, [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2954.16s)]
*  my name was called, bro. Yeah, what are you feeling? Then we go to an interview with Brian Gumbel [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2957.8399999999997s)]
*  down the street. Was it weird being with someone that much whiter than you on camera? [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2964.64s)]
*  He wants to talk about the weed and stuff like that right away. I'm like, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2971.3599999999997s)]
*  bro, this is going to be the happiest day of my life. We're not going to talk about all that [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2974.88s)]
*  bullshit. Did you say that to him? Of course. Good for you. I mean, for what? Why? Everybody [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2978.56s)]
*  knows what time it is. Yeah. You know what I mean? So why talk about that tomorrow? Yeah. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2983.84s)]
*  Yeah, that is an absolutely narcissistic thing to do. Yeah, he's different. It ruins somebody, [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2987.84s)]
*  the best day of somebody's life. Well, trying to get the sound back. Not ruin it, but try to chip [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2992.96s)]
*  away at it a little bit. You have to have zero empathy to even ask that question on that day. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=2997.28s)]
*  If it's a week later and you're at camp and you're doing that, that's part of the job. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3002.16s)]
*  How about the next day even? Yeah. Give me a day to be happy. You're with your family. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3005.7599999999998s)]
*  He put the sound bite over your happiness. Exactly. Yeah, really selfish. That's all right. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3009.44s)]
*  Shout out to Brian Gumbel. Keep shining, bro. And how do your parents react? My parents, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3012.8799999999997s)]
*  I was more happy for my grandmother and people like that, bro, because I used to give my [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3019.04s)]
*  grandmother like $400 a month when I was in the league and you thought it would be like $4,000 or [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3023.8399999999997s)]
*  $4,000. And does she support you when you were coming up? For sure, man. And then all my homies, [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3027.7599999999998s)]
*  we ride our bikes up to my grandma's house and she used to sew for people around town, [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3032.64s)]
*  do their laundry or whatnot. She'd have a gang of ones like she was going to strip club every night. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3036.56s)]
*  But she would give me six, seven, how many homeboys I have with me on our bikes. She'd [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3041.36s)]
*  make sure everybody could get a big golf or whatnot and stuff like that. So yeah, [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3045.6s)]
*  she looked out for sure. Wow. That's really cool. Okay. So you get to go to Sacramento. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3048.08s)]
*  Do you know the team that you're walking into? Are you familiar with these guys? This is a [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3052.56s)]
*  different generation where you can't exactly just go on Instagram and see their highlights. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3056.4s)]
*  Do you know the guys? I have no idea, but I knew C. Webb. I got traded there, but he didn't come [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3060.56s)]
*  for the first three or four weeks. Oh, that's right. He wasn't coming. There's no good soul food in [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3066.88s)]
*  Sacramento. That was the sound bite everybody glommed onto. Yeah. And his mom was very influential [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3071.2000000000003s)]
*  in getting him to finally come. Why? And his brothers too, his brother's like, look, they [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3076.7200000000003s)]
*  just drafted a kid from Florida. It's going to pass you the ball. It's going to be a lot of fun. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3080.8s)]
*  Oh, so they knew. They knew. Well, they made the trade for C. Webb prior to my drafting. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3085.28s)]
*  No, no, I'm saying C. Webb's family knew. They were kind of clocking you as well. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3092.56s)]
*  Well, yeah, because they were just trying to get him to come because if he don't come, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3096.72s)]
*  he's going to lose all that money, right? But you got to give credit to that organization [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3100.08s)]
*  for picking you. They're looking for a guy who can deliver to people that they believe in. And [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3105.12s)]
*  there's a lot of fucking mouths to feed on that team. Oh, yeah. It was a really fucking smart [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3110.56s)]
*  decision. But if you look back, all those guys, everybody on that team could pass the ball. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3116.08s)]
*  C. Webb was a great passer. C. Webb was a great passer. Yeah. Who smelled the worst? [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3121.04s)]
*  Floddy, right? You know what, man? It had to be floddy. They didn't smell the worst. They [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3127.7599999999998s)]
*  smelled different than we did. It's like they did showers differently. No, no, we get in the [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3134.32s)]
*  shower. We're going to shampoo our hair and then wash the body, what not. It's just like they go [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3142.0800000000004s)]
*  straight to the shampoo, bomb in head and chest and they're out of there. Yeah, nothing. And back [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3145.76s)]
*  then too, we'd have beer. Original whites. You know, back then too in the league, they'd have [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3151.36s)]
*  coolers of beer in the shower too. So guys that drank would be drinking in the showers right after [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3157.84s)]
*  the game. So a lot different now. Wow. Can you talk about like early rookie year hazing stories? [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3161.28s)]
*  Sure, man. I'm not even so sure they do that anymore, bro. Really? Yeah, but- [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3167.84s)]
*  That's what he's supposed to say. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3172.8s)]
*  It's a good call. I have some good ones. But when I was coming up telling rookies, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3174.1600000000003s)]
*  look, man, they're just trying. If you do it, you'll be fine. They won't even ask you to do it. So [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3179.84s)]
*  you want some stories of me or some other cat? Both. All of it. Oh, man. The best of the best. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3185.52s)]
*  I don't know if you remember this dude named Goran Girchek. He played with me in Memphis. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3189.52s)]
*  Maybe we remember him. Okay. He was about a 6'6". I want to say Slovenian maybe. I don't know. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3193.12s)]
*  But he's coming over here. You know, most of those guys that come over there, they've already played [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3199.6s)]
*  pro ball over there before they come here. So they don't think they're rookies here. I'm like, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3203.2s)]
*  that's a, no, no, no, no. You're a rookie. So Ike Alston and Grant Long in Memphis. Hey, look, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3206.96s)]
*  rook, bring some donuts in the morning. Then bring them. Like three days go by like that, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3213.28s)]
*  no donuts. And now I could tell these dudes get these, these some vets. Like, like I would be [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3217.6s)]
*  shook up at these vets. You know what I mean? Like don't piss these vets off because they're real [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3222.64s)]
*  vets. And like, I could tell like, look, rook, just bring some donuts. Just bring some donuts [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3226.48s)]
*  tomorrow for me. Just for me. Because I know what time is going to happen. And if you don't bring [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3231.68s)]
*  the donuts, it's going to be on your ass. They then gave you three or four chances. Nah, nah, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3235.92s)]
*  J. Will, I'm not a rookie. I'm not. All right. Next day, no donuts. So at the end of practice, [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3240.64s)]
*  they put a bin, like a big laundry bin in the middle. We pin our gear up, throw it in the bin [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3246.16s)]
*  so the equipment manager can go wash it. Well, they dumped all that shit out of there. Duck taped [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3250.56s)]
*  his legs, gear checks the rook. Duck taped his legs, hands behind the back, butt naked, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3255.52s)]
*  put him in the laundry bin, filled it up with ice, rolled him into the shower, filled it up with ice [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3262.0s)]
*  water, rolled him out onto the pyramid floor of Old Pyramid in Memphis, onto the game floor, [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3268.3999999999996s)]
*  right in the middle of the big old gris. Left his ass there for like three hours. Nobody found [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3273.04s)]
*  him. So I think maybe that's what I'm saying. So you can't mess with them OGs like that, man. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3280.0s)]
*  If they ask you to do something. Fight them off? I'm sure. But if you know Ike Austin and Grant Long, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3287.6s)]
*  you're not going to fight them. Wow. Not going to fight them, dude. No, sir. How effective was he [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3292.8s)]
*  after? Because Shaq said the only player I could never get to with the hazing was Goran, because [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3298.24s)]
*  he was from, I think he was Slovenian, Goran Dragic. And he was like, Shaq, you don't understand where [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3303.04s)]
*  I come from. This hazing thing is nothing. No matter what you do, it's not worse than where I [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3307.3599999999997s)]
*  came from. Yeah, but I don't know if they hog tied him. And then put him in an ice pack. Put him in [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3312.3199999999997s)]
*  an ice pack. That probably happened to a cousin of his back home. Yeah. Okay, okay. What else? What else? [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3316.3999999999996s)]
*  So they had me. How do you torture people? They had me one time. We landed in Boston [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3322.3199999999997s)]
*  and the snow was like, I mean, obviously it was a drift, snow drift, but it was like 20 feet high, [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3326.48s)]
*  right? And when we land, like NBA teams, you land, NBA guys are spoiled. You just walk from the plane [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3332.32s)]
*  to the bus. Don't worry about your luggage. Your luggage will be in the room when you need it, [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3337.92s)]
*  right? So the equipment guys and the airline guys are getting the bags from the side. So I had to [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3341.36s)]
*  get help with the bags this time. That was my rookie deal. But I had to do it without a shirt on. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3348.96s)]
*  You got to do, I want you to help put the bags on. So I'm like, well, fuck it, I'm madder than hell. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3353.2799999999997s)]
*  Madder than hell down there, but I'm doing it because I know I just got to do it. And they're [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3357.04s)]
*  just trying anyway, see if you want to fight it, right? So if you don't fight, if you fight it, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3360.48s)]
*  it's going to be worse. So I'm down there madder than hell. I want to open their bags and throw [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3363.44s)]
*  their clothes and shit everywhere, but boom, boom, one at a time. Boom. Get on there. I'm like, [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3367.2s)]
*  fuck it, I'm not riding with them motherfuckers. I hop my ass right up under the bus with the bags. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3370.88s)]
*  Close the door and off we go. I'll teach them. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3376.96s)]
*  Nobody asks for you, nobody. Bad decision. Why? It's cold as hell riding in there. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3379.04s)]
*  But they never asked me to do much after that. So I mean, like I said, if you just do it, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3389.6s)]
*  that'd be cool with you. Yeah. Who are you closest with, you think, on SAC? [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3394.16s)]
*  Had to be C-Web. C-Web. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. At what point in the season do you guys [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3398.16s)]
*  really jail and you realize there's something special happening? [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3403.04s)]
*  I mean, it had to be early because like I said earlier, we only had 50 games. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3405.52s)]
*  It was quick. But I remember the feeling of that team. And I remember, and keep in mind, [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3409.68s)]
*  this is a time where there's not that much distraction. We're watching basketball on, [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3416.96s)]
*  what, Tuesdays and Fridays? Oh no, no, that was the short team. We're watching basketball every [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3420.0s)]
*  night. But you're searching when the Kings are going to play. I grew up in New York City. I [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3423.36s)]
*  watched the Knicks. I'm not fucking searching for a Sacramento basketball team. We're searching, [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3428.16s)]
*  when is this fucking team going to play? It was so exciting. We just watched Sports Center all day. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3433.52s)]
*  So what are they going to play? Highlights. Who's the highlight machine? You and the Kings. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3437.6s)]
*  So you're just in our brains, dude. You took over basketball. The Kings and me, not you and the Kings. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3443.04s)]
*  Okay, I like that. Come on, bro. Okay. Now, do you start to feel the fame ever? When you're walking [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3448.56s)]
*  down the street, do you start to feel the recognition? And does that get to you at all? [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3454.72s)]
*  You comfortable with it? I guess I, like, yeah, I recognize it a little bit, but I don't, like, [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3459.04s)]
*  even, I don't, I never really look at myself as that, bro. Like, I'm just a normal dude, man. I [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3465.7599999999998s)]
*  can't imagine what it's like to be like LeBron and like, Tagger and guys like that. Like, come on, [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3471.52s)]
*  bro. They can't even go down to the grocery store and look for what kind of cereal they got out now. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3478.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? Who's Tagger? Yeah, Tagger Woods. Tagger Woods. What the fuck? Come on, bro. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3481.52s)]
*  Is that some old-lap? I heard Tagger. This is not Tech Window. I heard Tagger. Just because we're [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3487.68s)]
*  in New York, I ain't gonna change my mind. No, no, no. You say whatever you want to say, but [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3492.64s)]
*  my brain was working overtime for about three seconds. Like, what the fuck is Tagger? [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3496.7999999999997s)]
*  I thought it was a watch or tag viewer. I ain't so sure what Tagger was. LeBron and Tagger. Come on. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3501.6s)]
*  LeBron and Tagger. God doesn't know anything. No, I can't die. Did you see the confusion in my- [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3507.6s)]
*  I did, I did. Okay, but I like how you just- [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3513.68s)]
*  I see it in my kids' faces. They make fun of the way I talk, but yeah. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3515.52s)]
*  You had to make them run a bike. Yeah, that's right. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3519.28s)]
*  So yeah, I can't like the celebrity status and things like that. I never put myself in that [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3525.2s)]
*  situation. But is it uncomfortable for you coming from West Virginia, a thousand people? Florida at [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3530.72s)]
*  the time wasn't a basketball powerhouse, so you're kind of just doing there, which now all of a [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3535.2s)]
*  sudden you're nationally famous. Was that- There's a point in time where you have the [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3539.04s)]
*  best-selling jersey in the NBA. Yeah. You're aware of this. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3542.16s)]
*  Well, that's just because these dudes got some bad passes and made me look good, bro. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3545.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, but it's still, you are famous kind of out of never having dealt with anything like that. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3548.7999999999997s)]
*  But do you start to feel that expectation when you're going out there to hoop, [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3553.44s)]
*  or does it not affect hooping at all? Expectation was never there. My only thing [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3556.72s)]
*  that I was worried about was my 14 other dudes and my coaching staff, as long as they knew that I [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3560.3199999999997s)]
*  wanted to win. I wasn't out there telling behind the back passes for myself or trying to get on [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3565.3599999999997s)]
*  Sports Center. You know what I'm saying? I'm going to play this way, and if we win, [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3570.0s)]
*  then it's just going to be on TV. You know what I mean? That wasn't the expectation of me. Oh, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3574.16s)]
*  I'm on 301. I got to do something for y'all to watch on Sports Center tomorrow. Now that [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3579.36s)]
*  never entered my mind, bro. Could you see, because obviously at this point in time, [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3584.24s)]
*  you're probably not just seeing people play pickup, et cetera. But did people tell you how [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3588.24s)]
*  the pickup game started to change a little bit? Anybody tell you that? [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3592.72s)]
*  Like throwing crazy stuff like that? The pickup game? [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3596.64s)]
*  Growing up was always about getting buckets. I grew up in the city, [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3600.16s)]
*  I'm trying to cross you over. I'm going at your chest. I remember watching AI and I was like, [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3605.36s)]
*  I will never back down again. I don't care how tall you are. I'm going at your chest with my [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3610.32s)]
*  shoulder and I'm trying to lay it up. And I remember when you and that Sacramento team [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3615.2s)]
*  were sharing the ball and I saw the pickup game start to change. People wanted to drop dimes [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3621.92s)]
*  behind the back to no look. And it's very similar to what also happened with Steph. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3627.36s)]
*  I've noticed this with AI, you and Steph. Steph, everybody's three feet behind the three point line, [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3632.2400000000002s)]
*  which you would also do. Yes. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3637.92s)]
*  Yeah, but yeah, if I could shoot like Steph Curry, there would be no elbow pass. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3639.2000000000003s)]
*  Nobody's getting touched. You wouldn't be here. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3644.88s)]
*  No. No. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3647.44s)]
*  Angry Europeans. Okay, but I just felt like a transition going with the game. There was [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3648.0s)]
*  like a truly changed the way. And I felt it became intoxicating even with the team. I remember [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3654.16s)]
*  watching the team like, oh, everybody wants to make the extra pass. Did you feel that? [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3660.48s)]
*  I did feel that. But I mean, basketball is a beautiful game if it's played the right way to [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3664.64s)]
*  me. And it's so hard if we go out and play for me to get it done or for you to get it done for our [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3668.24s)]
*  team. If you use screens and you make the extra pass, it just makes the game so much easier. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3674.7999999999997s)]
*  How much easier is it for you instead of putting your shoulder down and crossing somebody up [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3681.36s)]
*  and banging into them and getting a layup as opposed to making one more pass, setting the [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3685.12s)]
*  back screen and going back door wide open? Boom. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3688.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? So I think it's just, everybody today thinks getting buckets is where [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3690.4s)]
*  it's at. And really, in realistic, it is. Yeah. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3695.6s)]
*  You look at the guards, like point guard, people ask me, could I play in today's game? I think I [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3698.32s)]
*  probably could. I had the talent to do it, but I think I'd have struggled because most of these [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3701.68s)]
*  point guards now got to get 30 or 25, 30 points a night for the team to be successful. And I [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3705.44s)]
*  didn't have that mentality to get buckets. But I also think you would have, you've said this [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3710.48s)]
*  before. I think you'd be better in today's NBA because it is more fast paced. We joking about [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3714.0s)]
*  the defense, but there's not like the, you have to play defense all the time. You can score and [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3718.72s)]
*  your 30 foot threes aren't looked at as bad shots anymore. Your three pointing would be encouraged. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3723.52s)]
*  You would have worked on. I feel like the Sacramento team is fine. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3727.84s)]
*  I feel like the Sacramento team was a today's NBA team. Like you had bigs that could shoot threes. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3733.36s)]
*  So I don't know. I feel like you would transfer to today's game. Wade, you have more people that [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3740.08s)]
*  can shoot from behind arc. Right. And more spacing too. Like you said, that's right. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3743.9199999999996s)]
*  Everybody wants, everybody wants all, they like wants offensive points. I mean, they want offense, [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3748.48s)]
*  right? They don't want 75, 80 point games. Right? Yeah. So yeah, you came up in the lowest scoring [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3752.16s)]
*  era in NBA history, probably. Right. And now I think you'd be, Chris Paul's not jacking up a [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3758.56s)]
*  ton of threes, but he's one of the best point guards in the league. For sure. Maybe one of the [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3763.6s)]
*  best point guards ever. Yeah. So I feel like you would actually be better in today's NBA than you [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3766.88s)]
*  were back then. You were a little bit before your time, man. Maybe a little bit. Is it true when you [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3771.28s)]
*  played the jazz in the playoffs, you told John Stockton, there's a new white point guard in that [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3775.84s)]
*  That's not true. I wouldn't, I wouldn't. I made that up. I don't know. I don't know who made it up. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3781.6800000000003s)]
*  John Stockton was a good player. Was he talking shit? He was a dirty player. He didn't talk shit. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3788.8s)]
*  He's filthy, right? He's a dirty player. I'm not so sure how much Listerine he ever had in his mouth [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3794.32s)]
*  either. But his hands were really big. Hence, he's all dribbling. He's right off the dribble. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3801.1200000000003s)]
*  Like 30 feet, but his hands were big. He played just a, I don't want to say dirty, [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3810.48s)]
*  because dirty is kind of like dirty. Like dirty, like grabbing your shorts on the back screen or [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3816.6400000000003s)]
*  stepping on your foot so you slow down a little bit. And like in the NBA, all you need is like a [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3822.16s)]
*  half second, whether you're open or closed or guarded. I've heard that about John before. So [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3826.96s)]
*  the competitive advantage, he had quick hands, big hands, a lot of control, but also he was trying to [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3833.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and he got away with a lot of shit too. The refs got, let him and Karl Malone get away with a [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3839.3599999999997s)]
*  lot of stuff in Salt Lake City. So here's the question. What is it like running into a Karl [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3842.3999999999996s)]
*  Malone screen? I tried to never do it for one, but my goal- They're putting you in that pick and [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3847.36s)]
*  roll. For sure, but my goal, I was just going to go under it every time. Every time I played [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3852.56s)]
*  against John Stockton, the game plan was to go under just to entice him to shoot the jump shot. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3856.8s)]
*  Because if you try to go over the screen, now he's in front of you and Karl Malone's rolling. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3860.48s)]
*  Forget it. Right. Forget it. 100%. Yeah. But my goal was against Karl Malone, [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3864.4s)]
*  I know I wasn't getting over the screen. My only goal was just to try to put my elbow right in his [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3869.1200000000003s)]
*  thigh. Every single time? Every time, just maybe one time I hit him good and the next time he's [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3875.6s)]
*  going to come and scream and he was thinking about, man, is he going to put his elbow, [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3880.0s)]
*  and if he moved it, baby, it would slide through there. Did it work? Not now. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3882.88s)]
*  Nope. Nope. Karl Malone, bad boy. Yeah. Yeah, bro. Yeah. Jerry Sloan too, rest his soul. Yeah. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3890.4s)]
*  Man, I think I would have liked to play for Jerry Sloan. I say that from the outside, but once I got [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3898.96s)]
*  in that fire, he and I probably would have wrestled a lot. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think he'd let [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3904.6400000000003s)]
*  you be free. No, sir. Also guys, Akash Locks are back. Look, I'm going to be honest, I didn't do [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3909.92s)]
*  great last week, but I still believe in myself and that's what's important. And even if you don't [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3914.8s)]
*  believe in me, go to prizepicks.com, download the app, use the promo code Schultz. They will match [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3918.7200000000003s)]
*  your initial deposit up to $100. That means if you put in 100, you get 100 for free. So you could [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3924.32s)]
*  trust my locks or don't, who cares? But here's my locks. CD Lam, more than 76.5 receiving yards. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3929.12s)]
*  He's been on a fucking roll. The Cowboys often sucks without them. I believe in that one. I also [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3934.8s)]
*  think Joe Mixon will get a TD of some kind. I just trust them. Who are the Bengals playing again? [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3939.44s)]
*  Miles hit me with it. The Texans. The Texans defense, I don't really trust. You could also [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3944.96s)]
*  potentially go Jamar Chase, 84 and a half receiving yards more or less. I don't know. 84 and a half is [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3948.96s)]
*  high, but I also know the Texans defense didn't look great last week and the Cincinnati offense [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3956.24s)]
*  did. So those are my locks. Go to prize picks. Use them or don't. Either way, you'll have fun. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3961.9199999999996s)]
*  It seemed like most of your coaches really let you flourish. Well, I didn't have much choice. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3967.2799999999997s)]
*  That's the other thing. Now, when I got to Pat Riley in Miami, I kind of, people say, well, [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3972.64s)]
*  you kind of settled it down a little bit. What was this different offense? You know, we got Shaq and [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3976.24s)]
*  got D Wade. Yeah. You know, those guys got to have a ball. So, you know, we go down two or three trips [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3980.64s)]
*  and Shaq can touch the ball. He'd be like, hey, I need a ball. I'm like, what Pat called 62. It [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3986.08s)]
*  don't matter. Is Pat out here? Pat's not out here. Throw me the ball. Do you think it's true that Pat [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3990.56s)]
*  saw what he had and then came down? I'm not so sure. Pat was the president at the time. Yeah. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=3998.3199999999997s)]
*  Stan Ben Gundy was the head coach. Yeah, for like two weeks. And then. Six years. Yeah. Yeah. I [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4004.0s)]
*  don't know if, I don't think, no, I don't think, I don't think that's how it went down. I think, [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4009.52s)]
*  I don't know though. Yeah. My opinion is maybe, maybe, maybe Coach Van Gundy didn't really want [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4014.88s)]
*  to be in that situation anymore. And maybe went upstairs and talked to Pat. Well, how can we, [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4019.92s)]
*  how can we resolve this? And Pat was like, well, shoot. I know a way. We could disown you. Yeah. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4024.4s)]
*  So I think that's what happened. Did you hear, and I don't want to get you snitch on anybody, [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4031.44s)]
*  so you don't have to answer this, but did you hear grumblings from players? Like, [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4034.4s)]
*  I don't know if this guy can understand. No, I never, I never heard that because, [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4037.52s)]
*  especially on that team, bro, with all those hall of famers and players that we had, [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4041.4399999999996s)]
*  it was like anybody could coach that team, right? You just had to tell us what time the bus was and [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4046.56s)]
*  what time the plane was. But no, I wasn't, I wasn't in that group of players. I wasn't ever [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4051.12s)]
*  in, ever in that situation in my career where I was in those type conversations about anybody. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4056.24s)]
*  You know what I mean? So no. When you go to the heat, do you notice one, a distinct difference [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4061.7599999999998s)]
*  between what a championship team is and what you'd been on before? [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4066.48s)]
*  For sure. And what is that? [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4070.8s)]
*  They won a training camp in Miami. Our only goal was to win a championship. Whereas I think maybe [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4073.84s)]
*  when I played for Sacramento, I don't know, I never really ever got that vibe ever. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4079.04s)]
*  I mean, maybe just because it was Shaq and Kobe out there. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4086.4s)]
*  You're going up against the Shaq and Kobe Lakers. So there's that. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4088.56s)]
*  And I don't, honestly down deep, I don't know if we really thought we were good enough to win [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4091.76s)]
*  a championship. Winning a championship is hard, man. Like in all levels, bro. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4096.0s)]
*  I heard you say this, you said it twice on all the smoke. You said, I didn't, we didn't [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4100.88s)]
*  understand what it really takes to win a championship. Then you said it again, what it really, what does it [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4105.04s)]
*  really take? [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4109.2s)]
*  Man, it just takes, it just takes so much. It's going to be like so much more like film, everything [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4109.84s)]
*  on a different level from film to, I mean, you hear it all the time, taking care of your body [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4115.92s)]
*  and things like that. And yeah, NBA guys do what they do, but come seven o'clock, they're going to [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4120.0s)]
*  be ready to play. And it's just, it's just the ride to the championship is more enjoyable than [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4125.04s)]
*  I think actually winning it because it's just us 15 guys. We've been together for over half a year. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4133.92s)]
*  We're with one another more than we are our families during the championship. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4140.32s)]
*  And you guys were locked in? [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4143.76s)]
*  Locked in, bro. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4144.88s)]
*  Who do you think you were closest with on that team? [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4145.68s)]
*  All 15 of us. I know it sounds cliche, bro. It does, but I think that's what it takes, man. Like [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4147.92s)]
*  I've been on a bunch of different teams and a handful of them, though, like we could all go hang [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4153.76s)]
*  out and have dinner together. Like that's so rare. And if you can do that off the floor and have that [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4158.320000000001s)]
*  kind of relationship, then on the floor, when push comes to shove, you're definitely going to trust [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4163.76s)]
*  that guy. You already know what time it is. You know what I mean? [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4168.320000000001s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit about NBA players do what they do because they've loosened things a little [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4171.12s)]
*  bit. Like we, you know, it's cool now. And then we hear the stories of like the Bulls back in the [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4177.2s)]
*  day, like the gambling and all that shit, the partying and then coming straight from Vegas and [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4182.8s)]
*  all that stuff. What are some of the craziest stories that we don't know about? [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4186.639999999999s)]
*  Thank you for finally asking that. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4191.36s)]
*  That's a good one, man. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4192.88s)]
*  That won't get you or anyone drunk. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4195.28s)]
*  Well, I mean, all the stories you hear are probably pretty much true, right? I mean, [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4197.36s)]
*  NBA guys are just different. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4200.639999999999s)]
*  We don't know that, but different in what way? [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4203.2s)]
*  You have to name names. What's the wildest thing you saw where you were like? [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4205.84s)]
*  Because you weren't partying really. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4208.88s)]
*  I didn't go out, bro. I didn't go to no clubs or anything like that. But for the Heat, though, [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4210.32s)]
*  like when I played for the Heat, it was like, you know, Shaq and D Wade, pretty big stars, right? [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4215.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4219.84s)]
*  So any city we go to, they're having a party. One's having a party here, one's having a party here. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4220.32s)]
*  They're having separate parties in the same city. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4224.4800000000005s)]
*  But that party's going to ravine. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4226.72s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4229.04s)]
*  At the hotel lobby. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4230.08s)]
*  Yeah, so I mean. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4232.08s)]
*  And are there girls just waiting, probably? [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4233.92s)]
*  You know, for sure. Like the NBA is like, I don't, I didn't get into that. You know, like I said, [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4235.76s)]
*  I didn't go to clubs or anything like that. But to answer your question, absolutely. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4242.24s)]
*  Really? [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4246.0s)]
*  I mean, it's just like every city. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4246.32s)]
*  Because we would hear about the girls that would just like stop the tea. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4247.84s)]
*  Find your hotel room. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4250.0s)]
*  Yeah, they find the hotel room. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4250.88s)]
*  Find your alias. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4251.68s)]
*  Because they're breaking off the Bellman. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4253.04s)]
*  Yep. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4255.12s)]
*  The Bellman's telling y'all, yeah, the Spurs will be here Thursday to Saturday type shit. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4255.36s)]
*  You know what I mean? So they know when they're coming. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4258.88s)]
*  What was your nickname for D Wade again? [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4261.36s)]
*  Booby. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4263.44s)]
*  And why did you call him that? [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4263.84s)]
*  Well, the Friday Night Lights. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4265.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4266.4s)]
*  Oh, Friday Night Lights. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4266.64s)]
*  If you want to win, let Booby spin. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4267.12s)]
*  That's what they're saying. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4268.4800000000005s)]
*  I'll tell Pat Riley, we'd be down in the fourth quarter and D Wade's going, hey, Pat, [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4269.44s)]
*  you want to win, you better put Booby's ass back in. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4273.04s)]
*  Pat Riley was cool, man. Cool as a fan. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4276.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. I mean, obviously as a Nick fan. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4278.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he took care of his players. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4281.2s)]
*  What is the relationship and why is he looked at as the godfather outside of his like hairstyle? [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4283.52s)]
*  Like, explain what he does. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4287.76s)]
*  I mean, he's just looking out for the cookout, man. He takes care of his players and like [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4290.64s)]
*  the Miami Heat organization is the best organization I've ever been a part of. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4294.96s)]
*  Why? [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4299.4400000000005s)]
*  Top to bottom just because the way they treat their players, the way they treat their family, [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4299.92s)]
*  the way they treat anybody that needs to be treated some type of way is just first class. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4304.240000000001s)]
*  What are some of the things they do? [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4308.72s)]
*  Like, say the owner wants us to stay in a, we go to Dallas and he wants to stay at a, [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4309.76s)]
*  let's just say a Motel 6. Well, Pat Riley ain't having that because Pat Riley, [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4315.200000000001s)]
*  if he was going to Dallas on his own, he's not staying in a Motel 6. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4318.8s)]
*  So we're going to stay at the Ritz-Carlton order four seasons. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4321.6s)]
*  Wherever Pat stays, that's what it's. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4323.76s)]
*  And Pat will pick up whatever the difference was from the hotel. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4325.2s)]
*  So see, these are things we don't hear about with Pat. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4330.0s)]
*  We hear about it's like his Pat system. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4332.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you hear about Heat culture. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4334.64s)]
*  But Heat culture is really letting the players know that if you buy in, [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4336.8s)]
*  you are going to be 100% taken care of. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4340.8s)]
*  That's right. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4342.56s)]
*  Your family. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4343.2s)]
*  If you buy in. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4343.84s)]
*  You're going to have a chance to win too, right? [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4344.320000000001s)]
*  There's always going to be a chance to win in Miami. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4345.76s)]
*  Would you have like sit downs with Pat? [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4348.16s)]
*  Probably not cordial sit downs. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4352.4s)]
*  Probably more like, you know, I'm getting in trouble type shit. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4353.84s)]
*  It's like, wait, wait, wait, why did you get in trouble? [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4356.32s)]
*  I mean, you know, it's just, it's like, Pat wrote these things on the board. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4357.84s)]
*  Like every game he would mark players like, if you were help side D, you get a point. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4362.32s)]
*  If you weren't, you minus. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4367.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4368.32s)]
*  That type of shit. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4368.639999999999s)]
*  So every morning we come into practice and chat. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4369.36s)]
*  Wow, he's doing the plus minus before it's even a statistic in the league. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4372.72s)]
*  Do you guys know what the plus minus statistic is? [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4376.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4378.8s)]
*  It's basically you can explain. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4379.04s)]
*  I thought it was a stat at that point. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4380.96s)]
*  Like if they're running a side pick and roll and you're a guy, [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4382.24s)]
*  you're guarding the gallon opposite side, [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4384.72s)]
*  your job defensively is to be in the middle of the floor to be the help. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4386.56s)]
*  If you're not there, you get a minus. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4390.4s)]
*  It's like his own plus. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4392.56s)]
*  So the thing like that. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4394.32s)]
*  The plus minus in the league now is just like, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4395.28s)]
*  while you're on the floor is your team scoring more points or less points than the other team. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4397.52s)]
*  But this is like an even more sophisticated analytics. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4401.52s)]
*  Shit, you hear all this. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4404.8s)]
*  So next morning, you know, how much am I helping? [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4407.6s)]
*  How much am I hurting? [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4409.52s)]
*  And that's accountability. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4410.08s)]
*  You get to look at a number. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4410.96s)]
*  Easy. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4413.04s)]
*  And now I'm not being hard on you. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4413.68s)]
*  This is the thing that happens. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4415.84s)]
*  So every morning we come in and chat D Wade, all five starters, the last five. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4417.6s)]
*  He's preaching all year. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4423.12s)]
*  Look, whoever has the highest numbers this year, they're playing the minutes. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4424.08s)]
*  They're playing the minute. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4426.96s)]
*  Earl Barron, remember Earl Barron? [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4427.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4429.04s)]
*  He had off the chart numbers, but he only played average like 0.3 minutes. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4430.320000000001s)]
*  Oh, we're playing. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4435.76s)]
*  We're playing the guys with the high numbers. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4436.400000000001s)]
*  I'm like, Pat, you're talking out of both sides of your mouth. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4438.96s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4441.68s)]
*  Oh, you didn't like that. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4442.64s)]
*  You put all these numbers up here. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4445.4400000000005s)]
*  Shaq and D Wade, our best two players. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4447.12s)]
*  They're look, they're garbage. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4448.96s)]
*  Look, but they average 35 minutes a night. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4450.88s)]
*  So you need to take that. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4453.68s)]
*  Shit, the numbers mysteriously disappeared. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4454.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't think I think I think Coach Riley was like, he was the kind of guy like, [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4461.04s)]
*  don't really like confrontation. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4464.88s)]
*  He like dishing it. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4466.24s)]
*  But you know what I'm saying? [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4467.84s)]
*  He doesn't want to push back. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4468.56s)]
*  I think I think he don't really push back in front of people. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4469.4400000000005s)]
*  May he allow the push back in his office. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4472.320000000001s)]
*  But I'm not type of guy like shit. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4474.96s)]
*  It is what it is. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4476.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4477.360000000001s)]
*  You're pushing forward in public. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4478.400000000001s)]
*  I'm pushing back. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4479.52s)]
*  Of course. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4480.08s)]
*  I mean, why not? [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4480.88s)]
*  Right? [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4481.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4481.92s)]
*  And I think that sometimes he gets credit for reigning you in or whoever you played with the [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4483.04s)]
*  Miami Heat. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4488.72s)]
*  Would you say that that was more of a decision you made based on the personnel on the team? [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4489.360000000001s)]
*  For sure. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4494.48s)]
*  I mean, we didn't run many fast breaks because like I said earlier, we got to slow the ball [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4494.879999999999s)]
*  down and get the ball to D-way and shot. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4498.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4500.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, and again, I'm not out on a fast break looking to throw behind the back passes. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4500.639999999999s)]
*  If it happens, it happens. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4506.0s)]
*  Sometimes like if I'm swinging the ball, if you've got the ball there and I'm trying to [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4508.08s)]
*  get it over there and you swing it to me, for me to take this pass and take it from here [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4511.679999999999s)]
*  to here as opposed to here to there. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4515.679999999999s)]
*  Is quicker. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4518.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4518.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4518.959999999999s)]
*  So and like I said earlier, if I take one more, if Ray Allen's open in the corner [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4519.28s)]
*  and I take one more dribble, he's not open anymore. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4524.24s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4527.12s)]
*  So he needs that ball right now because that defender is good enough to respond. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4527.599999999999s)]
*  NBA finals, probably less than a minute left. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4532.16s)]
*  Baseline jumper that you hit. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4535.5199999999995s)]
*  Do you remember? [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4537.5199999999995s)]
*  I do. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4538.16s)]
*  If we're looking at TV is down here in this corner. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4539.28s)]
*  Biggest shot in your career. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4542.08s)]
*  That's that's to go up to the game was tied. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4544.719999999999s)]
*  It probably felt like the biggest shot. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4548.4s)]
*  I'll probably make bigger shots in my career. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4550.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4551.92s)]
*  But I mean. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4552.32s)]
*  What could be bigger than NBA finals? [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4554.08s)]
*  Is it the is it the game? [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4556.5599999999995s)]
*  See, is that the series ending game? [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4559.5199999999995s)]
*  It might have been, but I'm thinking not even a shot will be the biggest. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4561.2s)]
*  But I remember coming down after behind that. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4563.759999999999s)]
*  I feel behind the back pass to Alonzo morning and Devin Harris's ass. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4565.679999999999s)]
*  I looked at the film. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4569.44s)]
*  He just am shocked me right into the cameras and they didn't call no foul. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4570.16s)]
*  But Zo dunked it. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4574.24s)]
*  I think that that felt better to me because it felt like that just put them out of reach for sure. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4575.5199999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4581.44s)]
*  Okay. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4581.839999999999s)]
*  So it wasn't just the lead. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4582.08s)]
*  It was closed out the game. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4583.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4585.12s)]
*  But still it was a ballsy shot. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4585.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, I don't even know if it was end of the shot clock, but I remember watching it. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4587.44s)]
*  I remember seeing you. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4590.88s)]
*  You weren't exactly open, but you didn't even think about it. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4592.0s)]
*  Like I said earlier, I initiated the offense. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4594.72s)]
*  I stand in the corner and them dudes always told me if you get the ball in the corner. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4596.72s)]
*  Toss that. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4600.0s)]
*  Shoot it. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4600.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm not throwing it to you just to throw it to you. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4601.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4603.6s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4604.4s)]
*  So I'm like, you got it fired up. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4604.88s)]
*  How is Shaq is a teammate? [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4607.44s)]
*  Shaq's great, bro. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4608.72s)]
*  Everything you see on Shaq on TV, bro. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4609.44s)]
*  That's exactly how it is. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4610.96s)]
*  Seems like the best. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4612.0s)]
*  It's not a fake at all, dog. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4612.8s)]
*  I mean, that is the way it is, bro. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4614.4s)]
*  Real as it gets. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4616.4800000000005s)]
*  And you guys would hang out like off the court? [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4617.52s)]
*  We would. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4619.84s)]
*  He used to live in Orlando too, but he sold his house there in Orlando since he's working [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4620.24s)]
*  for Turner. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4623.84s)]
*  I guess he's in Atlanta now. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4624.32s)]
*  But yeah, man, that's that dude there, bro. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4625.6s)]
*  There's not a better human being in this whole wide world than Shaq, man. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4628.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4631.44s)]
*  I'm telling you. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4631.84s)]
*  Wait, why do you say that? [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4632.4s)]
*  Just because he's just always looking out for everyone. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4633.44s)]
*  Like, I mean, you see the stories being at Walmart or whatnot and seeing a family with [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4636.64s)]
*  five people or whatnot, he's out there buying them a van. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4640.88s)]
*  That kind of stuff. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4644.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4645.2s)]
*  Making his sneakers. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4645.52s)]
*  It's like Mr. Beast but not for YouTube. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4645.76s)]
*  Yeah, sneakers were sold at Walmart or whatnot for like 30 bucks. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4647.28s)]
*  Made them cheaper so they won't come by. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4650.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4651.92s)]
*  That's the real Shaq, man. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4652.72s)]
*  That's not a facade, bro, you see on TV from Shaq. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4654.24s)]
*  That's who he is. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4656.88s)]
*  That's who he is, man. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4657.52s)]
*  How different was his physical ability from the Lakers to the Heat? [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4658.4800000000005s)]
*  Because you played with them and then against them. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4664.24s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't see much. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4665.6s)]
*  Maybe his athleticism, maybe a little bit. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4667.28s)]
*  He didn't jump as high. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4669.2s)]
*  But Shaq is the most dominant player to ever play basketball to me. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4670.08s)]
*  It made him change the rules to his own. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4673.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4675.2s)]
*  I mean, yeah. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4675.84s)]
*  You can't stop that dude one-on-one. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4677.92s)]
*  And then you send a double team down, which is usually a little guy like me. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4679.68s)]
*  Forget it. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4682.72s)]
*  He not seeing none of that, bro. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4683.2s)]
*  He gonna eat all of us on the way. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4684.8s)]
*  Do you have any stories where Shaq helped someone out that people don't know? [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4687.36s)]
*  That you saw where you're like, oh, he picked up a tab here or did something for someone? [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4690.72s)]
*  No, I've never seen. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4694.0s)]
*  Like I said, I didn't really go out, things like that. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4695.6s)]
*  Sure. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4697.5199999999995s)]
*  I wasn't ever in that situation, though. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4698.08s)]
*  What about the greats? [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4700.32s)]
*  What about the greats? [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4701.28s)]
*  Greatest you've played with, against? [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4702.8s)]
*  Who are the people that you remember, you're reflecting? [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4705.2s)]
*  And you hear obviously names, Kobe, Dwayne. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4708.08s)]
*  Every night, man, it was like a dream come true for me, bro. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4712.8s)]
*  Remember Speedy Claxton? [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4716.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4717.6s)]
*  Bro, people ask me all the time who's the hardest dude to guard. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4718.32s)]
*  And Speedy Claxton was like- [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4721.68s)]
*  Stony Brook, right? [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4723.76s)]
*  Hofstra. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4724.8s)]
*  Or Hofstra, Long Island. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4725.4400000000005s)]
*  I knew it was a Long Island school, yeah. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4726.4800000000005s)]
*  When you played in Golden State, they had Speedy Claxton was a bro. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4728.56s)]
*  And they had four white dudes that could shoot the joint, right? [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4731.36s)]
*  They were really the first team that really ran four guys out and just shooting three. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4733.36s)]
*  So they ran a high pick and roll with Speedy Claxton. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4737.52s)]
*  They had Dunleavy and Troy Murphy. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4739.76s)]
*  Troy Murphy, yeah. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4743.44s)]
*  Bro, and that high pick and roll with Speedy, he was so fast. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4745.52s)]
*  And if he got around you, it was a layup. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4749.68s)]
*  If the help came, he was just spraying it for three. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4752.88s)]
*  So when people ask me who was one of the hardest people I had to guard, [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4755.12s)]
*  well, I say Speedy Claxton. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4757.92s)]
*  They're like, fuck Speedy Claxton. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4759.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4761.36s)]
*  What about most underrated player? [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4762.16s)]
*  It doesn't mean you have to guard them, but just in general, [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4764.64s)]
*  who's the person you don't think gets enough flowers? [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4766.4s)]
*  I'm going to say Andre Miller. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4768.24s)]
*  In my time, Andre Miller. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4769.68s)]
*  I loved Andre Miller, dude. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4771.2s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4772.16s)]
*  Bro, he didn't even lace his shoes up tight. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4772.64s)]
*  He was old school, take his shoestring around his ankle and then tie him in the front. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4777.5199999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4782.24s)]
*  And this shit would be so loose and his game was so awkward and just like, [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4782.88s)]
*  if you watched it from afar, you'd think he was garbage. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4789.04s)]
*  But at the end of the night, you look at the stat sheet and he's out like 27. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4792.08s)]
*  He played for a while. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4796.0s)]
*  12 and 12. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4796.64s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4799.28s)]
*  So that's the answer. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4800.8s)]
*  And eight out of 10 folks, I didn't even know who Andre Miller is. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4801.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4805.4400000000005s)]
*  I feel like you were playing while the league was transitioning to, [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4806.64s)]
*  I would say, a softer league. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4810.08s)]
*  But do you feel like right now versus when you started, is the league soft? [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4812.719999999999s)]
*  I don't want to use the word soft. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4817.599999999999s)]
*  I just want to say I think the league has made it more offensive. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4818.799999999999s)]
*  It kind of take the defense out of the game. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4822.959999999999s)]
*  They've incentivized the offense. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4824.639999999999s)]
*  They don't want to see Flager fouls. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4826.48s)]
*  You know, Flager fouls, they get fined and then they're going to review and all that shit. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4827.679999999999s)]
*  Like, just let the refs ref. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4831.839999999999s)]
*  They're going to miss calls. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4834.5599999999995s)]
*  Just like players are going to miss shots, right? [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4836.24s)]
*  Let them be human. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4837.839999999999s)]
*  So to answer your question, I don't think it's softer. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4839.839999999999s)]
*  I think the players are still physically and physically dominant more than any other sport. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4842.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4848.72s)]
*  I think NBA athletes are the best athletes in the world. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4849.6s)]
*  I'm not being biased. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4852.48s)]
*  I just think that those guys have a better chance to cross it over to a different sport [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4854.0s)]
*  and being successful easier than, say, a football or hockey or baseball guy coming to play basketball. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4859.52s)]
*  I could be wrong, but that's just my opinion. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4866.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4867.6s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4868.56s)]
*  You play for the Heat. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4869.12s)]
*  You guys are talking about it. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4870.0s)]
*  You're down 0-2. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4870.96s)]
*  You're down 14 in the fourth. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4871.76s)]
*  I'm a Mavs fan. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4873.84s)]
*  I'm ready. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4874.64s)]
*  I think it's over. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4875.28s)]
*  What happens? [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4876.64s)]
*  Is there something in that huddle? [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4877.52s)]
*  I heard Pat Riley just wrote season on the whiteboard during a timeout. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4878.88s)]
*  Does any of that stuff matter or is it just? [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4883.12s)]
*  It's not sure. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4885.36s)]
*  He wrote like, I don't remember the exact words, but it was like, [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4885.76s)]
*  some of the long lines, I'm only packing one tie, one suit after this game. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4890.88s)]
*  During the timeout when you're down 14? [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4895.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4896.8s)]
*  Wow. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4897.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4897.6s)]
*  I mean, he could have just meant you're getting swept. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4897.92s)]
*  It was close. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4901.92s)]
*  It was close. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4903.6s)]
*  Oh, believe me, I know. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4904.24s)]
*  That timeout killed him, man. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4905.44s)]
*  I'm telling you, that timeout was all downhill. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4906.64s)]
*  Wait, wait, what happened? [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4908.8s)]
*  Well, there was a free throw. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4909.92s)]
*  We were shooting a free throw. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4912.56s)]
*  No, they were shooting a free throw. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4914.16s)]
*  We were shooting a free throw and there was like eight seconds or something like that left. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4915.44s)]
*  I think I remember this, yeah. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4919.28s)]
*  And they only had one timeout left. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4920.24s)]
*  So they would wait until after the second foul shot to call a timeout, [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4922.32s)]
*  and then they advanced the ball and take it out up there on the front court. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4924.4800000000005s)]
*  So Avery Johnson was like, we want to time out after the, you know, [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4928.72s)]
*  well, what was his name? [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4933.28s)]
*  Oh, damn, forget his name. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4934.48s)]
*  He, Josh, Josh something. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4936.4s)]
*  Josh Howard. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4938.8s)]
*  Josh Howard. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4939.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4940.4s)]
*  He was looking at Avery Johnson's calling, [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4940.96s)]
*  want to time out after the second free throw. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4943.52s)]
*  Well, Josh Howard called it in between. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4945.76s)]
*  I remember this. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4947.68s)]
*  The referee didn't have any choice, but he got to call, [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4948.48s)]
*  he got to blow the whistle and call a timeout right now. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4951.92s)]
*  So now they're out of timeouts. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4953.92s)]
*  They can't advance the ball and, you know, [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4955.04s)]
*  they got to race up the floor like six, seven seconds and get a bad shot. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4956.96s)]
*  Wow. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4960.4s)]
*  Joey Crawford as mean as everybody says. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4962.08s)]
*  No, I think he was fair, man. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4963.92s)]
*  Even Scott Foster, the guy that got in, not Scott Foster, the Donahue guy. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4965.28s)]
*  Tim Donahue, yeah. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4968.56s)]
*  He gave all that championship to that. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4969.44s)]
*  Yeah, he gave. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4970.8s)]
*  He was fair. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4974.24s)]
*  I honestly, I thought he was one of the better refs in the league, bro. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4976.4s)]
*  I never would have imagined. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4979.36s)]
*  People are gambling on you. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4980.8s)]
*  This guy's making all the calls. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4982.0s)]
*  That's right. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4987.04s)]
*  And look back on it. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4989.6s)]
*  It's easy for a referee to gamble. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4990.72s)]
*  Because if you call two quick fouls on Shaq in the first quarter, [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4992.08s)]
*  he got to sit out the rest of the half. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4995.92s)]
*  So you might have over, under in the first half or whatever. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=4997.44s)]
*  That's really interesting. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5000.48s)]
*  You can change the game. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5001.52s)]
*  Two little calls. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5002.56s)]
*  You take 10 minutes off of Shaq playing. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5004.8s)]
*  Or a technical early on Draymond Green in the first quarter. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5007.52s)]
*  Now, he got to play the rest of the game without. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5011.12s)]
*  Cautious. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5012.8s)]
*  He's not talking back. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5013.5199999999995s)]
*  He's not into it. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5014.96s)]
*  So you could change the game. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5016.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's not about waving off a shot. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5017.76s)]
*  It's not about waving. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5020.16s)]
*  You could change the game the first fucking quarter. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5022.24s)]
*  He's the only one who got caught. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5024.08s)]
*  Because other guys might have danced. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5026.64s)]
*  Yeah, because how much are these guys getting paid? [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5028.0s)]
*  That's the other thing. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5029.44s)]
*  They got a lot of responsibility for not making a lot of money. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5030.0s)]
*  And usually when their jobs where you have a lot of responsibility [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5034.08s)]
*  and you aren't getting paid according to that responsibility, [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5037.04s)]
*  there's some corruption. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5039.92s)]
*  For sure. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5041.12s)]
*  Like you see that with cops a lot, right? [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5041.76s)]
*  Like all aspects of life. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5043.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5045.28s)]
*  There's levels to everything and everything, right? [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5046.48s)]
*  And what about like vets? [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5049.2s)]
*  Like did you think the vets get a little bit nicer treatment? [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5050.24s)]
*  I don't say the vets. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5053.12s)]
*  I think guys, the stars for sure. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5054.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5057.28s)]
*  I mean. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5057.599999999999s)]
*  Did you get a little like, did you don't think? [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5058.72s)]
*  Them referees was, fuck them referees. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5062.0s)]
*  Shit. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5067.92s)]
*  Wait, why? [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5068.42s)]
*  I love them all. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5069.28s)]
*  I had a good relationship with all of them, but I didn't get nothing. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5070.32s)]
*  No. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5073.44s)]
*  What did you want? [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5075.12s)]
*  What did you think? [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5075.84s)]
*  I mean, I just wanted to be fair. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5076.32s)]
*  Push me to call a foul. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5078.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5080.719999999999s)]
*  I mean, a little push on me is sending my little ass way over there. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5081.12s)]
*  And then, you know, you breathe on Steph Curry or what? [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5084.639999999999s)]
*  This thing, the stars, they get the foul call, right? [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5087.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5090.0s)]
*  I don't like that. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5090.24s)]
*  Now I understand that he's going to get more calls than me. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5091.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5093.2s)]
*  But goddamn, throw me a bone every now and then. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5093.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5095.5199999999995s)]
*  You ever get into it with the ref? [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5095.92s)]
*  Of course I did. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5097.12s)]
*  I remember like it was yesterday. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5097.759999999999s)]
*  It was in Dallas. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5098.719999999999s)]
*  Back in their old arena. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5100.0s)]
*  Their old arena. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5102.0s)]
*  Payback. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5102.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5103.44s)]
*  It's like you had both teams exit the same side down there on that end. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5103.759999999999s)]
*  But our visiting bench was away. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5109.04s)]
*  Most teams come out of the locker room and their bench is right there. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5112.4s)]
*  So I'm in it with Bob Delaney. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5115.679999999999s)]
*  I'm in it like, fuck. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5117.12s)]
*  And he's like, keep on going. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5120.96s)]
*  And when you're done, let me know. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5122.48s)]
*  Then we're going to throw you out of here. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5123.44s)]
*  So I'm like, all right, well, fuck it. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5124.799999999999s)]
*  I kept on going a little bit longer than expected, right? [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5125.839999999999s)]
*  And she said, are you done? [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5128.32s)]
*  I said, yeah, I'm done. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5129.44s)]
*  He said, bang. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5130.08s)]
*  All right, now you're out of here. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5130.5599999999995s)]
*  And I'm still cussing. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5131.44s)]
*  I'm walking towards my bench, going to the locker room, right? [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5132.32s)]
*  Matter of hell, I got kicked out. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5135.2s)]
*  Cussing him the whole way. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5136.4s)]
*  La, la, la. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5137.2s)]
*  And I get down there and I realize, fuck, I got to walk all the way down. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5138.719999999999s)]
*  So I mean, I didn't have no choice but to just start cussing him back. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5142.32s)]
*  I'm walking all the way back down there. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5148.8s)]
*  But yeah, that was probably the coolest one. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5150.719999999999s)]
*  That was the coolest one. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5152.719999999999s)]
*  Your boy. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5153.5199999999995s)]
*  He saw me walking out of there and gave me a big hug after the game. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5154.24s)]
*  So it was good. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5156.719999999999s)]
*  Your boy Nick was the only one you were playing a mensley you got into the ref one time. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5157.52s)]
*  No, mensley. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5160.72s)]
*  I get into refs, man. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5161.52s)]
*  Like one time you maybe you were running at him. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5162.56s)]
*  Well, I would. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5165.52s)]
*  There's multiple. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5166.72s)]
*  Multiple. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5173.4400000000005s)]
*  This is an awesome story. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5174.0s)]
*  So look, these referees in these mensleys, they have no idea, right? [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5175.280000000001s)]
*  They're just happy, really happy to see me. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5178.88s)]
*  I'm just going to keep it real. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5181.200000000001s)]
*  They're happy to be ref in my game, right? [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5182.400000000001s)]
*  So these refs start cheating and I'll just get. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5184.160000000001s)]
*  Start cheating. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5187.52s)]
*  I'm an NBA player playing with guys that work at UPS. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5190.96s)]
*  I ain't got nothing to do with that though. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5195.200000000001s)]
*  Just because I worked a little harder on my ball handling doesn't mean a foul is a foul. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5198.0s)]
*  I'm to the point now, we'll back it up a little bit, we just talked about the Stars getting [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5203.4400000000005s)]
*  called. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5206.72s)]
*  I'm the goddamn star now. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5207.280000000001s)]
*  Finally, I should get in. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5208.72s)]
*  And they're thinking the opposite way. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5210.56s)]
*  They're thinking like you, I'll play in the NBA. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5212.8s)]
*  You can foul the shit out of me. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5214.8s)]
*  What type of shit is that? [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5216.080000000001s)]
*  That's like the point. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5217.52s)]
*  That's like the argument. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5218.320000000001s)]
*  That's like the argument when people talk about LeBron and Jordan. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5219.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5222.160000000001s)]
*  They talk about what? [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5222.4800000000005s)]
*  The bad boy Pistons beat Jordan up. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5223.4400000000005s)]
*  LeBron couldn't handle it. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5226.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, no. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5227.4400000000005s)]
*  You're saying that the bad boy Pistons was good because they just fucking took you right [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5229.280000000001s)]
*  on air? [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5233.040000000001s)]
*  They were legal things, yeah. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5233.68s)]
*  That doesn't make them good. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5234.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5235.360000000001s)]
*  But anyway, back to the rec league. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5235.6s)]
*  So the referee's cheating, whatever. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5236.96s)]
*  And I get to the point where I get the ball full speed and the refs, I'd run right at [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5238.400000000001s)]
*  the ref full speed and skate, like dodging right at the last minute. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5242.240000000001s)]
*  He's backing up down near Fallon. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5245.76s)]
*  But I don't think that was the best one. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5248.72s)]
*  I think the best one, we're in Miami. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5250.08s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5252.56s)]
*  So on the fast frame. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5253.360000000001s)]
*  He crossed up the ref. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5254.8s)]
*  You were trying to get the ref. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5256.0s)]
*  At any time I got the ball. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5256.8s)]
*  He would cross the ref, bro. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5257.92s)]
*  I'm running right at the ref trying to run him over. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5259.360000000001s)]
*  He tripped him. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5262.24s)]
*  The ref tripped. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5262.96s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5263.6s)]
*  No, you dropped the ref with a crossover? [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5264.24s)]
*  Like I said earlier, the hell with these refs. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5266.400000000001s)]
*  On all levels. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5272.400000000001s)]
*  You break the ref. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5273.84s)]
*  I haven't handled so good. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5277.280000000001s)]
*  You fucking break the ref. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5278.56s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5280.64s)]
*  The best one over in Miami. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5281.200000000001s)]
*  I got two good ones. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5283.120000000001s)]
*  We got time for two. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5284.4800000000005s)]
*  We got to get Nick in this one. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5285.280000000001s)]
*  And we got Coach Coughlin. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5287.84s)]
*  So get with it. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5289.360000000001s)]
*  So look, we're playing Miami in the summer. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5290.160000000001s)]
*  I'm playing with Tim Hardaway Sr. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5292.96s)]
*  He's the great. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5294.64s)]
*  He's like my- [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5295.360000000001s)]
*  That crossover was crazy. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5295.76s)]
*  He's like my idol now when it comes to referees. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5296.8s)]
*  So we're playing and he gets kicked out of the game. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5299.360000000001s)]
*  It's like we got three minutes into the game. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5301.04s)]
*  He gets kicked out. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5305.12s)]
*  He's got the ball with him. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5306.4s)]
*  One little guy had a ball. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5307.5199999999995s)]
*  So he's like fuck y'all want the ball? [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5308.96s)]
*  You had a ball. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5310.16s)]
*  He then laced his shoes up on the way out. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5311.2s)]
*  He unplugged the scoreboard. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5313.28s)]
*  From the scores table. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5315.6s)]
*  Took that with him so nobody else could play the rest of the night. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5316.88s)]
*  If I could have that scoreboard signed by Tim Hardaway, that would be priceless. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5321.36s)]
*  I thought this was an NBA game. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5324.88s)]
*  This is a record. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5327.6s)]
*  I'm taking my ball and I'm going home. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5331.04s)]
*  They took the scoreboard. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5332.64s)]
*  Wait, how many ex-NBA guys are hooping in this league? [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5333.84s)]
*  Oh, it's a pretty good league. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5336.16s)]
*  Oh, so this is high, high. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5337.44s)]
*  It's a pretty good league, yeah. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5338.8s)]
*  So it's my turn the next week. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5340.56s)]
*  And I'm in the same referee. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5342.0s)]
*  Tim's not there. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5343.6s)]
*  He got set out again, right? [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5344.32s)]
*  No fine, no money. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5350.72s)]
*  So we're the same referee cheating us. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5354.08s)]
*  We're down. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5355.68s)]
*  We're down. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5360.08s)]
*  We can't win. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5360.56s)]
*  It's like we're down five with like four seconds. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5361.360000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5364.080000000001s)]
*  But it's our ball. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5364.400000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5365.280000000001s)]
*  Call timeout. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5365.76s)]
*  Just to piss the refs off to get going. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5366.88s)]
*  So I tell the guys like, just do whatever you want. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5369.92s)]
*  I'm going to bring the ball inbounds. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5371.76s)]
*  So ref hands me the ball and I don't know if y'all know, [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5372.96s)]
*  the ref's got the whistle in his mouth and as soon as he hands the inbound of the ball, [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5375.04s)]
*  he's going to count. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5378.240000000001s)]
*  You only got five seconds to bring it in. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5378.72s)]
*  So he's one, two. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5380.080000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, ah, I already know what I'm going to do. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5381.92s)]
*  Nobody knows though. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5383.68s)]
*  Ref standing right there with the whistle. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5384.56s)]
*  Well, so when he gets to five, he's going to blow his whistle, call a penalty. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5385.76s)]
*  A delay game, whatever. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5389.2s)]
*  He gets to four and he gets about right there. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5391.12s)]
*  Boy, I yanked the whistle out of him. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5393.599999999999s)]
*  So now, he's standing there like, what you going to do? [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5399.28s)]
*  He was like, that's the game. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5410.88s)]
*  You love this rec league. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5415.12s)]
*  NBA guys just go to rec league to torture refs because they could never do it in the league? [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5416.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, no, not necessarily. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5421.12s)]
*  We're going to torture the refs if they try to act like they know what they're doing. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5422.08s)]
*  They got no clue. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5426.16s)]
*  They got no clue. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5426.88s)]
*  Playing the big three. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5427.76s)]
*  I played the first year, yeah. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5430.72s)]
*  And I tore the ACL the first half of the first game. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5431.84s)]
*  What happened? [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5435.12s)]
*  You know what, man? [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5436.0s)]
*  I was just, it was crazy, man. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5436.64s)]
*  I was just dribbling. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5438.32s)]
*  I did a jump start. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5439.28s)]
*  Trying to cross over a ref. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5439.92s)]
*  Not in refs. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5442.4s)]
*  It wasn't full court, so they weren't in my way. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5443.28s)]
*  Like, I just jump stopped, bro. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5445.84s)]
*  And it just felt like my knee felt like it kept going. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5447.04s)]
*  And it started burning. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5450.72s)]
*  And it was bad news. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5451.68s)]
*  Were you warmed up for it? [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5453.2s)]
*  Had you had knee problems before? [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5456.16s)]
*  Like, I'm just- [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5457.68s)]
*  Never had an injury before. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5458.32s)]
*  I mean, I twisted an ankle. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5460.24s)]
*  I think never a significant injury ever. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5461.36s)]
*  Did you have the, what is it, Osgood Schlauters or whatever that shit is called? [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5462.8s)]
*  Like, you used to wear those little- [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5465.68s)]
*  I wore those little fluke things because Vince Carter wore them. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5467.28s)]
*  And I thought, hell, maybe I'll start jumping a little bit higher if I start wearing a knee. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5470.16s)]
*  Son, I started wearing them because you were wearing them. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5473.6s)]
*  And then I couldn't play without them. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5476.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think I got so used to them playing. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5478.4800000000005s)]
*  But I mean, I thought they looked cool, too. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5481.68s)]
*  I thought this was a health thing because I would have- [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5484.160000000001s)]
*  Sometimes when you're growing, when you're younger, you can get some pain right for those in me. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5486.72s)]
*  Yeah, but they didn't help me. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5490.64s)]
*  But I was like, ah, Jason got it. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5491.92s)]
*  I was just trying to jump like Vince. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5494.160000000001s)]
*  Motherfucker. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5495.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh, that's so funny. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5496.240000000001s)]
*  No, this rec league was mostly like ex-MBA guys. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5497.200000000001s)]
*  But apparently there were some current NBA guys that might also play in the rec league. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5499.92s)]
*  Is that true? [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5503.76s)]
*  Like maybe if you were playing for the Magic, would you ever sometimes go play? [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5505.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5510.16s)]
*  It was like to the point where my last- [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5510.64s)]
*  You brought fucking ringers to the men's rec league? [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5511.92s)]
*  Just me? [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5514.4800000000005s)]
*  She's the ringer. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5514.88s)]
*  So I'm on the Magic- [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5515.84s)]
*  While you were playing? [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5516.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm on the Magic roster, right? [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5517.68s)]
*  And they started, they signed Chris Doohan to be their backup. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5519.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5523.52s)]
*  Give them some money. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5523.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5524.4800000000005s)]
*  I love Chris Doohan. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5524.72s)]
*  Yeah, dookie. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5525.68s)]
*  Bad decision. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5526.8s)]
*  Orlando Magic. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5527.52s)]
*  You know how the Heat's the best organization in the world? [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5528.64s)]
*  Orlando's the worst. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5530.8s)]
*  What? [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5531.76s)]
*  Don't tell me that, bro. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5534.4800000000005s)]

*  Even from Orlando, bro. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5537.12s)]
*  Don't tell me that. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5538.160000000001s)]
*  Chris liked to throw them back, too. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5539.04s)]
*  Chris is my guy. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5540.56s)]
*  I ain't mad at Chris at all. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5541.84s)]
*  Go get all that bread. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5543.04s)]
*  But that organization, you guys see the garbage truck driving around, right? [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5544.160000000001s)]

*  That's the Magic. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5551.6s)]
*  Don't say- [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5554.160000000001s)]
*  Not the organization. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5554.88s)]
*  Not the team. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5556.400000000001s)]
*  Why, why, why, why, why, why? [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5557.36s)]
*  Not the team. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5558.48s)]
*  Not the city, everything. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5559.2s)]
*  Not the players. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5560.32s)]
*  It's the organization, bro. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5561.36s)]
*  The organization just got the wrong people running it, man. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5563.2s)]
*  That's my opinion. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5566.88s)]
*  What do I know? [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5568.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5568.88s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5569.2s)]
*  I just- [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5569.679999999999s)]
*  And you got some money out of them? [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5570.48s)]
*  I'm just, yeah. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5571.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, I'm just putting levels. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5572.4s)]
*  You know, the Heat is here. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5576.719999999999s)]
*  I can only do what I- [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5578.08s)]
*  I can only tell you what I know, right? [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5579.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5581.5199999999995s)]
*  And it just- [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5581.759999999999s)]
*  What was so bad? [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5582.799999999999s)]
*  No care about the players? [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5584.639999999999s)]
*  No, or players that have been through there too, [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5586.16s)]
*  they don't even care about. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5589.6s)]
*  I could call Miami. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5591.28s)]
*  I could call Memphis. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5592.24s)]
*  I could call Sacramento. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5593.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5594.88s)]
*  And we all could go to the game, [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5595.36s)]
*  and we're all sitting on the floor. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5596.8s)]
*  But you live in Orlando. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5598.32s)]
*  I'm right there. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5600.08s)]
*  I've been trying to get to Orlando since day one. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5601.5199999999995s)]
*  Let's rewind all the way back to the beginning of my draft. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5604.72s)]
*  Chuck Daly, did I tell you this story? [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5607.68s)]
*  Rest his soul. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5609.28s)]
*  He was the coach of the Magic. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5610.16s)]
*  And me, I wanted to go to get drafted by the Magic my year, [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5611.2s)]
*  but they had 11th pick. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5614.16s)]
*  I knew we weren't going to make it that far. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5615.2s)]
*  So we have Bryce Drew. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5617.12s)]
*  Remember Bryce Drew from Valparaiso? [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5618.4s)]
*  Hit that shot and then dove on the floor in the NCAA tournament? [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5620.5599999999995s)]
*  No. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5623.679999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5624.72s)]
*  Another white dude. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5625.2s)]
*  He's another white dude about my size. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5626.16s)]
*  We went down there and worked out one time, [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5628.0s)]
*  and I did my thing against Bryce Drew that day. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5629.5199999999995s)]
*  And their general manager called my agent back and said, [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5633.44s)]
*  we'd like to bring Jason and Bryce back in. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5636.08s)]
*  We didn't know who was more athletic. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5639.12s)]
*  Well, that lit a fire under my ass [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5641.36s)]
*  because that's another reason the Magic the organization did that. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5642.72s)]
*  How could they not know? [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5646.56s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5647.6s)]
*  This is like it's night and day. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5648.4800000000005s)]
*  So we go back, we set it up. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5650.64s)]
*  Sure, let's set that up. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5652.08s)]
*  I told my agent, let's set that up. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5652.96s)]
*  So they're thinking about driving Bryce Drew before me. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5654.4800000000005s)]
*  You crazy. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5656.4800000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5657.2s)]
*  So we go in, we go in the workout. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5657.76s)]
*  Before the workout starts, I'll go over to Chuck Daly says, come here. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5659.68s)]
*  He says, look, I know who's more athletic. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5662.4800000000005s)]
*  I know who's more talented. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5665.12s)]
*  They want to do this. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5666.400000000001s)]
*  We're going to play one-on-one right from the get-go. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5667.52s)]
*  I got a tee time in an hour. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5670.08s)]
*  Let's have this thing over in about 20 minutes. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5672.72s)]
*  I said, yes, sir. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5674.56s)]
*  How long? [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5675.4400000000005s)]
*  Shit. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5676.400000000001s)]
*  Bryce Drew got a better chance pissed in a hot sauce bottle. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5678.400000000001s)]
*  I'm telling you, ain't no chance. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5680.72s)]
*  Now, what happens to those guys in their workout? [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5684.08s)]
*  They're fighting for their life and you're cooking them. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5687.76s)]
*  Oh, they, like I said, they just. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5690.320000000001s)]
*  Do they get chippy or they just melt? [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5692.0s)]
*  It's probably the same way as like when I got to try to guard Russell Westbrook. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5694.16s)]
*  That's the way I feel like, what the fuck am I going to do? [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5697.68s)]
*  Yeah, what happens with Russ? [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5700.16s)]
*  You just got to hope he misses. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5701.44s)]
*  And you just backing off. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5703.28s)]
*  Just trying to get a hand in his face. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5704.639999999999s)]
*  If I get a hand in your face, like Allen Iverson, [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5705.919999999999s)]
*  if I get a hand up and you make that jump shot, what can coach say? [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5708.5599999999995s)]
*  That's right. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5711.28s)]
*  Now, my big guy's not mad at me from coming over to help, not getting in foul trouble. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5711.919999999999s)]
*  Let's go back down. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5716.0s)]
*  So Orlando sucks, huh? [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5718.32s)]
*  To me, man, it's just the organization. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5719.919999999999s)]
*  They got the players. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5722.5599999999995s)]
*  They got the talent. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5723.44s)]
*  They got all kinds of talent. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5724.32s)]
*  You would play rec league and. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5725.44s)]
*  Oh, yeah, back to the store. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5727.28s)]
*  Back then when they signed Chris Dewan, I was out of the rotation. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5728.48s)]
*  So I'd be in practice all day or whatnot. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5731.599999999999s)]
*  I'm like, well, shit, I got it. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5733.2s)]
*  We got a game of seven, a direct. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5735.759999999999s)]
*  We practiced from like two to four. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5738.16s)]
*  And then I go play in the men's league at seven. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5739.839999999999s)]
*  So, oh, general, general, what is it? [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5741.839999999999s)]
*  They're paying you millions of dollars. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5744.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5746.879999999999s)]
*  You're playing for free. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5748.08s)]
*  That's right. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5748.879999999999s)]
*  So Oda Smith was the general manager at the time called my agent like, [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5750.96s)]
*  hey, look, Dan, you can't be playing in the rec leagues. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5753.44s)]
*  He said, well, shit, he got to get his run somewhere. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5756.24s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5758.32s)]
*  And I always had like, I don't know how many guys, [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5759.12s)]
*  if they'd still have like a for the love of the game clause in a contract. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5760.88s)]
*  So yeah. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5764.56s)]
*  Can you explain that? [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5765.6s)]
*  So if something like I'm driving home from practice or something, [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5766.56s)]
*  I see a pickup game and I want to go hoop. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5768.8s)]
*  You can do it. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5770.400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5770.96s)]
*  If I get hurt, I'm still going to get my bread. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5771.2s)]
*  Yeah, there's a contractual, I guess, permission to play whenever you want. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5772.8s)]
*  I don't know if they still have that or not. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5779.04s)]
*  I thought they stopped that like when you saw Kobe started playing in like [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5780.32s)]
*  streetball leagues and then they were like, yo, we got to chill. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5784.64s)]
*  They might have. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5786.8s)]
*  If you get hurt. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5787.36s)]
*  Well, I think I think like the Drew league and things like that. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5788.16s)]
*  Rucker park or whatever. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5790.4s)]
*  Carbouts or like if they get NBA sanctioned, then you can where the NBA [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5791.36s)]
*  could come in and check out the facilities and shit like the floor, [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5795.759999999999s)]
*  make sure all that shit, you know, something like that. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5798.4s)]
*  Park was. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5800.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5800.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5801.04s)]
*  Like, I don't know if Rucker Park was, I don't know what the rules were. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5801.28s)]
*  Did you ever play up there? [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5804.32s)]
*  No, I was just talking to Nick. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5805.12s)]
*  How the fuck did you not play? [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5806.08s)]
*  I wish I would have. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5807.2s)]
*  We were talking about right. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5808.48s)]
*  I've never even been there. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5809.28s)]
*  I want to go step foot on the Rucker Park. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5810.639999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5812.16s)]
*  What about what about Drew? [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5813.12s)]
*  No, they try to get me to play later on in my career, but it was. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5814.5599999999995s)]
*  I didn't have what drew league fat crowd wanted. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5817.6s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5821.6s)]
*  I feel like you do. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5822.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5823.360000000001s)]
*  You have exactly that. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5824.0s)]
*  I feel like minus the skip. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5825.04s)]
*  You're a little like. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5828.0s)]
*  But outside of that, I think you would have what they wanted. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5830.88s)]
*  I think that's another thing, like the black and white issue. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5834.72s)]
*  Like once you get on the court, bro, if the bros or the white boys [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5837.280000000001s)]
*  could see that you could hoop, they didn't care what color you were. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5840.72s)]
*  So you know, it's funny. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5842.64s)]
*  There's like, I think there's all this credit like that you were hooping, [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5843.68s)]
*  like a black dude. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5847.28s)]
*  But I don't know any black dudes in the NBA that were hooping like you. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5848.5599999999995s)]
*  I think we saw streetball, but you were playing in such a unique way [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5852.24s)]
*  that it was always really funny to me that people ultimate street crap. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5858.0s)]
*  You play like streetball. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5861.84s)]
*  Of course, 100 percent. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5863.92s)]
*  But it was like even the name white chocolate. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5865.2s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5868.0s)]
*  It was as if like every other black dude was playing like this. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5868.8s)]
*  And it's like, no, they weren't like. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5871.5199999999995s)]
*  And even when Rafer came into the league, Rafer wasn't getting off like he would get [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5873.36s)]
*  off in and won. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5876.88s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if I don't know if Rafer had the opportunity. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5877.76s)]
*  You didn't have the opportunity. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5881.76s)]
*  You just did the shit. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5882.8s)]
*  Well, I mean, I'm like, like when I got drafted, you know, I was the only [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5883.6s)]
*  point guard on the team. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5886.56s)]
*  So I had to I had the keys. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5887.36s)]
*  I was going to rock. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5889.28s)]
*  He let me rock and Rick Allen was shout out to Rick Allen, my coach for Sacramento. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5890.0s)]
*  He told me in the first game, he said, you know, if you come down and throw [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5893.76s)]
*  a behind the back pass and it goes out of bounds, he said, don't worry about it. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5897.52s)]
*  Next time, try it with your left hand. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5900.56s)]
*  So so here and that kind of like. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5902.400000000001s)]
*  First time you've ever heard that from a coach, probably. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5905.2s)]
*  Well, I mean, or maybe maybe I was told I wasn't listening. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5907.04s)]
*  I was going to do what I wanted to do. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5911.12s)]
*  Fuck with you a little bit or did it put a battery in your back? [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5912.32s)]
*  I think I put a battery in my back because it's kind of like, look, he got my back, man. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5914.88s)]
*  He's like, like, he knows I'm trying to win. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5918.08s)]
*  So whatever, whatever I got to do to win, that's what I'm going to try to do. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5920.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5923.679999999999s)]
*  Did you ever have like you obviously have all these amazing passes and assists. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5924.08s)]
*  Did you ever have one that was embarrassing where you're like, I'm going to do one behind [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5926.96s)]
*  the back and it just went all the way up in the stands. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5930.24s)]
*  You're like, oh, fuck. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5932.24s)]
*  I'm probably have more than one brother. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5932.96s)]
*  I'm trying not to remember him. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5934.32s)]
*  You know, I'm probably more so in practice. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5935.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5938.4800000000005s)]
*  We all like in practice. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5938.72s)]
*  I didn't really care. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5939.44s)]
*  You know, like I was back to the point like if I messed up so many times, what are you [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5940.64s)]
*  going to do to make me run? [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5943.92s)]
*  Well, that's just going to benefit me. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5945.04s)]
*  So I'm thinking, yeah, because at the end of practice, we're going to run as a team, [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5946.4s)]
*  but I ain't going to run as hard as if I got in trouble over here running by myself [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5950.24s)]
*  because I'm going to try to run hard and get back in the game. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5953.12s)]

*  At the end of practice, fuck, I don't care about that. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5955.44s)]
*  That's a cool perspective. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5957.2s)]
*  You can't punish me because it's just going to be better. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=5958.0s)]

*  Now let's get back to the show. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6113.04s)]
*  They did make apparently a rule for you or a rule about you, apparently after you retired [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6114.08s)]
*  and then you went back in the league. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6119.28s)]
*  Apparently you retired because you were going to the Clippers and you were like, [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6121.68s)]
*  I don't really want to do that. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6124.88s)]
*  And so you retired and then you went back with the magic, right? [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6126.24s)]
*  Oh, but with the Grizzlies. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6128.72s)]
*  Oh, with the Grizzlies. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6130.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6131.04s)]
*  And so what was the law that could have put in? [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6131.2s)]
*  I forget the name of that law. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6133.28s)]
*  I forget they did name it something. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6134.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6136.24s)]
*  I think they called it the Jason Williams law. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6136.48s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6138.16s)]
*  Like the Larry Bird rule, Larry Bird rights or whatever. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6139.2s)]
*  How about the I don't want to play for Donald Sterling rule? [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6141.84s)]
*  How about that? [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6143.679999999999s)]
*  Well, there's some stuff went down, you know, and over the summer. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6144.8s)]
*  You got to keep that away from your wife. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6148.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6149.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6149.599999999999s)]
*  There you go. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6150.32s)]
*  It's very white chocolate. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6150.8s)]
*  But yeah, I think that was the best thing to have for me is not to go to LA probably. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6151.84s)]
*  I mean, definitely I was going to play for the, not that it mattered about the money, [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6156.32s)]
*  but I was going to play for the league minimum on that deal. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6159.599999999999s)]
*  And by the time my wife and my kids got out there and we rented a house and [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6162.320000000001s)]
*  shopping and all that shit, I'd have been in the red, bro. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6165.76s)]
*  So it's probably. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6168.24s)]
*  Wow. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6169.12s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6169.68s)]
*  So did you retire because you don't want to go to the franchise because you were done, [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6170.16s)]
*  you felt like you were injured or like what brought you back ultimately? [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6172.88s)]
*  I think maybe Michael Hysley was the owner of God rest his soul. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6177.04s)]
*  He was the owner of the Grizzlies. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6180.16s)]
*  What paid me my first big contract, my only really big contract. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6181.2s)]
*  What was that one worth? [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6184.56s)]
*  Like 40 some million. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6185.76s)]
*  How does that feel? [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6186.96s)]
*  It felt great. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6188.0s)]
*  Like. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6189.12s)]
*  I mean, it ain't shit today, but. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6189.6s)]
*  But it. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6191.2s)]
*  Can you rationalize it? [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6192.32s)]
*  I mean, like, does it even make sense? [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6193.599999999999s)]
*  It doesn't. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6194.96s)]
*  It didn't make any sense. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6195.28s)]
*  Like, like. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6196.24s)]
*  Your grandma's giving you a dollar and all your boys, a dollar to get a big goal. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6196.88s)]

*  You couldn't tell me nothing. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6205.2s)]
*  And then you get a 40, how much 40? [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6206.48s)]
*  43 or something. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6209.12s)]
*  43 million dollar contract. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6209.92s)]
*  It was, it was, and they didn't really have to do it. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6212.32s)]
*  You know, my agent was like, he told me it was like on a Friday, they were having discussions. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6214.96s)]
*  Like Friday, he called me and said they're going to offer you 40 million. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6218.64s)]
*  But I said, but the what? [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6222.64s)]
*  But what? [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6226.320000000001s)]
*  He said, we're going to wait till Monday. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6227.92s)]
*  Maybe I'll get you some more. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6229.4400000000005s)]
*  And I'm thinking, well, what if they changed their mind? [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6230.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6232.56s)]

*  Well, that happens. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6235.6s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6236.240000000001s)]
*  So what happened with the German kid? [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6236.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6238.400000000001s)]
*  Well, what if, what if the owner's buddy comes in and say, man, [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6238.56s)]
*  why would you sign that kid for that? [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6241.68s)]
*  When you can get him for this? [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6243.360000000001s)]
*  You give him three days to think about it. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6244.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, bro. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6245.84s)]
*  What's the kid's name who he played great in the few, the black German kid. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6246.32s)]
*  I can't believe. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6251.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, Dennis Schroeder. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6252.32s)]
*  Dennis Schroeder. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6253.12s)]
*  Schroeder was offered. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6253.84s)]
*  And he turned it down. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6255.44s)]
*  He turned down. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6256.4s)]
*  And having an early snow well. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6256.96s)]
*  Now, is he turning down or is his agent advising him, hey, turn this down. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6258.24s)]
*  We have something else. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6262.32s)]
*  And then he ends up getting a contract worth a fraction. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6263.5199999999995s)]
*  Dude, there was a guy played for the Heat, Anthony Carter. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6265.599999999999s)]
*  There was like an option on his deal for like 25 million. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6268.08s)]
*  And his agent forgot to make the call to pick up the option or whatever. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6271.28s)]
*  Something like that. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6275.36s)]
*  And then he lost a million in the 90s. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6276.08s)]
*  But yeah, I don't think it's the agent's fault. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6278.719999999999s)]
*  You need personal accountability. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6282.08s)]
*  At the end of the day, though, you're the guy. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6283.44s)]
*  Yeah, you're working for me. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6285.5199999999995s)]
*  100%. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6286.88s)]
*  You need personal accountability. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6287.5199999999995s)]
*  But I do understand a kid who's never been offered that kind of money. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6289.12s)]
*  And all these people telling them, oh, we got a deal coming in from this team and that team. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6292.32s)]
*  You can kind of get lost in it. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6295.599999999999s)]
*  Okay, so you get your 43. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6297.599999999999s)]
*  Do you sign it that Friday or do you wait till Monday? [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6300.88s)]
*  Wait till Monday. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6303.12s)]
*  Oh, that must have been terrifying. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6304.16s)]
*  Awful. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6305.44s)]
*  I'd rather he not even told me that. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6305.92s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6307.2s)]
*  Oh, no. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6308.4s)]
*  Because if the deal wasn't there on Monday, Bill Pollack gets his ass whooping. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6308.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6312.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6314.88s)]
*  No choice. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6315.12s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6315.84s)]
*  So you get it. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6317.12s)]
*  And then is there a first purchase? [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6317.84s)]
*  Do you like tell your friends? [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6319.5199999999995s)]
*  It's public knowledge. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6320.72s)]
*  But like, do you feel like you have to share that info with your family? [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6321.68s)]
*  Like, what is the first thing that happens? [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6324.32s)]
*  I'm thinking so, yeah, for sure. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6325.92s)]
*  My dad and I were close. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6327.12s)]
*  So he knows everything. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6328.48s)]
*  He's kind of really, if it wasn't for, he signed my agent for me, really. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6329.599999999999s)]
*  He chose my agent. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6332.88s)]
*  I would have took the first $5,000 you gave me from any agent. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6334.96s)]
*  I would have been stuck to you. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6338.0s)]
*  So he knew what time it was with that. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6339.04s)]
*  So he interviewed different agents and picked this one. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6340.32s)]
*  I would have never picked this agent that I had. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6343.04s)]
*  Never. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6345.92s)]
*  Because his personality wasn't like what I wanted or he and I were totally different. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6346.96s)]
*  But you needed that shit. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6351.76s)]
*  He was great. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6352.72s)]
*  He was great. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6354.24s)]
*  Think about that. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6355.2s)]
*  He connects you with Nick. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6355.68s)]
*  You whooping with Orlando. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6356.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6358.24s)]
*  Wow. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6359.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6360.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6360.4s)]
*  And how did your dad know all this? [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6360.96s)]
*  Was he like a businessman? [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6362.48s)]
*  My dad was a state policeman in West Virginia, man. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6363.52s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6365.68s)]
*  No nonsense kind of guy. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6367.120000000001s)]
*  And then, you know, when I got in trouble with smoking weed at Florida, [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6369.120000000001s)]
*  I was more worried about him and his, what his friends were going to think of him. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6373.120000000001s)]
*  Like, you've been a state police for 20-something years [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6376.4800000000005s)]
*  and now your son's smoking pot or whatever. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6378.64s)]
*  You know, like, how's that going to make him feel some type of way? [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6381.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6384.080000000001s)]
*  Did he? [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6384.64s)]
*  I think it hurt him for sure. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6385.360000000001s)]
*  But everything worked out, bro. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6388.96s)]
*  Could he who? [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6390.240000000001s)]
*  He was a good player. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6391.200000000001s)]
*  He had a twin. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6392.88s)]
*  He was a more all-around player, but his twin brother was a better shooter, better scorer. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6393.92s)]
*  But yeah, they were good players. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6399.04s)]
*  They couldn't receive a scholarship because they played in some kind of men's league [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6400.4s)]
*  growing up and received like a check or some money. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6403.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, no. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6405.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6406.48s)]
*  That's also probably where he was like, you got to be wise. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6409.04s)]
*  Have the right guy. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6411.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6412.32s)]
*  Okay. So 43, what do you buy? [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6412.72s)]
*  First thing I bought was a Range Rover. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6414.48s)]
*  Okay. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6415.92s)]
*  I mean, I grew up in a trailer in West Virginia, bro. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6417.04s)]
*  I never had a house till I got an MBA. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6420.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6422.4s)]
*  But you couldn't tell me nothing. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6423.04s)]
*  And you got the Range. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6424.56s)]
*  Yeah. I bought some cars and things like that, but I never really splurged on it. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6426.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6430.64s)]
*  Anything dumb? [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6431.84s)]
*  I'm sure there was some dumb stuff, like a big ass earring or some big old diamond number [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6433.2s)]
*  or something like that. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6439.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6440.56s)]
*  It wasn't dumb then. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6440.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6441.84s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6442.34s)]

*  We were talking about Orlando and this has kind of been a news, a topic in the news. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6452.4s)]
*  Gay players in the NBA. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6457.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6459.04s)]

*  Do people know about it? [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6463.6s)]
*  Does it? [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6465.04s)]

*  John Amici. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6469.12s)]
*  John Amici. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6469.68s)]
*  He was one of the first ones to come out. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6470.32s)]
*  Yeah. He was the guy. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6471.84s)]
*  Does that throw off chemistry on a team? [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6473.12s)]
*  Like, does a team not want to get... [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6475.36s)]
*  Also the Collins brother? [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6476.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6478.08s)]
*  We always talk about how hard that is for the other brother. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6478.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6481.360000000001s)]
*  Because they're twins and nobody knows which until it's too late. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6481.84s)]
*  Jason and Jerry. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6487.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6488.64s)]
*  You gotta come up with a hairstyle deal or something. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6489.12s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6490.72s)]
*  Go teaming on or something. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6492.56s)]
*  For sure, there's definitely gay players in the NBA. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6494.56s)]
*  Just like there's probably gay players in all sports, right? [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6497.84s)]
*  Probably gay guys in this room. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6500.0s)]
*  Maybe. You never know. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6501.360000000001s)]
*  Never know. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6503.200000000001s)]
*  And ain't nothing wrong with being gay, right? [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6506.08s)]
*  I mean, she is if that's what you want to do. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6508.48s)]
*  Dwight would take you guys on shopping sprees, right? [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6511.52s)]
*  Wouldn't he? [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6513.76s)]
*  The white man, he would take us on shopping sprees. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6514.32s)]
*  Looking back on that, are you like... [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6518.32s)]
*  Man, looking back on that, I don't even know what's going on with that situation [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6519.6s)]
*  or what's real and what's not. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6523.28s)]
*  But all I can say is brothers is one of the most dominant basketball players ever. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6524.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6530.72s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6531.04s)]
*  Top for short. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6531.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6532.64s)]
*  For sure. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6532.88s)]
*  He would strap them on and just get after them. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6538.56s)]
*  Yeah. Big D. He was the D player of the year. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6540.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6543.28s)]
*  No, but... [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6543.84s)]
*  Three times. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6544.24s)]
*  But back to your question... [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6548.48s)]
*  Shout out Dwight, though. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6549.6s)]
*  Shout out Dwight, bro. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6550.32s)]

*  ...of your life. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6551.84s)]
*  Should be top 75. I don't care what's going on out there or over there. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6552.24s)]
*  It's top 75. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6556.8s)]
*  I don't think there's enough attention played, especially to the early partner's career. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6557.2s)]
*  No, that's Superman, bro. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6560.16s)]
*  That's Superman. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6561.44s)]

*  Who else? [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6588.88s)]

*  Dre Mon is a little bit. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6596.24s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6597.92s)]
*  No Dre Mon in there. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6598.320000000001s)]
*  Ben Wallace, maybe a little bit. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6599.2s)]
*  Oh, Ben Wallace. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6600.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6601.360000000001s)]
*  But I hear you. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6602.0s)]

*  So like I said, all the other shit that he's got going on in his life, I don't know what's cracking over there. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6603.76s)]
*  And he was doing it with distraction too. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6609.68s)]
*  That's the other thing. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6611.92s)]
*  Like most players get to just focus on the game. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6612.56s)]
*  He's got to not think about how hot everyone is. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6615.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6617.52s)]

*  Come on, dude. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6625.4400000000005s)]
*  Super. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6626.56s)]
*  You're right. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6627.280000000001s)]
*  Hey, look. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6627.76s)]
*  Live your life, bro. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6628.240000000001s)]
*  When I played with him in Orlando, bro, I never got that vibe. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6630.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6633.120000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6633.360000000001s)]
*  I never. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6633.76s)]
*  I mean. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6634.400000000001s)]
*  But everybody that I've heard has said that he's the most generous, sweet teammate, like is in shape, is working out. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6635.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6643.280000000001s)]
*  They are in shape usually. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6643.6s)]
*  This guy's crazy. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6645.040000000001s)]
*  Come on, bro. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6646.0s)]
*  He's crazy. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6647.040000000001s)]
*  NBA players. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6647.6s)]
*  I'm talking about NBA players. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6647.84s)]
*  What is he even talking about? [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6649.120000000001s)]
*  Superman, bro. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6649.84s)]
*  NBA players are in shape, dude. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6650.4s)]
*  Come on. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6652.24s)]
*  For the most part. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6652.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6653.759999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6654.48s)]
*  But back to your question of like, for sure, I don't think it messes with chemistry. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6655.28s)]
*  If you've got championship aspirations, realistically look at it. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6661.28s)]
*  At the beginning of every year in every sport, not just basketball, there's three or four or five teams [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6665.44s)]
*  that realistically have a chance to win a championship that year, right? [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6670.16s)]
*  I'm a Viking fan. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6674.5599999999995s)]
*  They can't win a championship this year. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6675.5199999999995s)]
*  The Magic. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6678.16s)]
*  If they're down there in their locker room thinking about championship this year, they're [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6679.360000000001s)]
*  bullshitting themselves, right? [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6681.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6682.8s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6683.2s)]
*  Seriously. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6683.76s)]
*  So when it comes to that, if a gay guy is on a team that has championship aspirations [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6685.6s)]
*  during those two hours for that game, it ain't going to affect the team at all, in my opinion. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6692.8s)]
*  Because he knows what time it is. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6697.280000000001s)]
*  The gay guy knows what time it is when he gets on that court because he knows what these guys want [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6700.4800000000005s)]
*  to accomplish. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6704.88s)]
*  He got some bullshit coming in, these guys ain't going to allow that. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6706.88s)]
*  I'm sure you heard Steve and A speculate that's why Dwight didn't get signed because of that. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6709.36s)]
*  Do you think that would really stop a player from getting signed? [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6715.04s)]
*  Me personally, no. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6718.24s)]
*  If I was the owner of a team, I'm trying to win. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6719.52s)]
*  So if you can help me win, I'm signing you, bro. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6722.24s)]
*  All this hoopla about Colin Kaepernick and things like that, I'm sure he can still play. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6726.32s)]
*  But I think if he was good enough to help an NFL team win, he'd be on the [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6730.4800000000005s)]
*  team. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6735.84s)]
*  They'll deal with all the other bullshit they had to deal with later. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6736.4800000000005s)]
*  Yo, I heard an interesting thing about Cam Newton because the Cam thing was, [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6738.56s)]
*  is he good enough to be a backup? [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6744.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6746.32s)]
*  But the problem is Cam ain't a backup. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6747.6s)]
*  And a buddy of mine, Derek Postman, was talking, remember we were talking to Derek about this. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6751.52s)]
*  And he was like, yeah, Cam isn't a backup. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6755.12s)]
*  And he's going to just attract so much attention on a team that the second, the starting quarterback [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6757.4400000000005s)]
*  has an off game. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6763.04s)]
*  All of a sudden, all the media is talking about, hey, why don't you put Cam in? [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6764.16s)]
*  So it puts this pressure on the team that is unnecessary. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6767.5199999999995s)]
*  And looking at it like that, I was like, oh, it's not like hoops. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6772.4s)]
*  Hoops is a little different. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6777.28s)]
*  You want to stack your team. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6778.24s)]
*  You will get time. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6779.36s)]
*  There's no backup quarterback that rotates in and out. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6782.56s)]
*  See, I think if you got a guy like Pat Riley running the show, he sees that before coming in, [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6785.12s)]
*  before I'm signing Cam Newton. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6789.68s)]
*  He sees that. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6791.92s)]
*  And he's already telling the media, look, if you write this bullshit, you won't be in [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6792.72s)]
*  our locker room. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6796.240000000001s)]
*  You won't get no more interviews. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6796.72s)]
*  Oh, can Pat control that? [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6797.76s)]
*  Pat Riley? [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6799.4400000000005s)]
*  Like, tag or say, tagger. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6801.12s)]
*  Tagger. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6802.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6803.04s)]
*  Pat Riley controls what, if Pat Riley wants something, he's getting it. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6803.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6807.360000000001s)]
*  So he is the godfather. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6808.240000000001s)]
*  Fucking right. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6810.88s)]
*  And the players fall in line with that. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6812.400000000001s)]
*  They respect it or what is it? [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6815.2s)]
*  Yeah, they respect it because he respects them. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6816.88s)]
*  Like he's taking care of them. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6818.64s)]
*  He's protecting them. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6819.68s)]
*  He's putting you up at the Four Seasons instead of the Motel 6. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6821.200000000001s)]
*  Do you wish you had played for him earlier? [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6825.280000000001s)]
*  No, not really because I don't think I would have been who I was. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6827.84s)]
*  Because he's, you know what I'm saying? [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6830.56s)]
*  He's like... [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6832.080000000001s)]
*  It's tight leash. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6832.96s)]
*  Yeah, he's not going to, no fast breaks. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6833.76s)]
*  It's more half court ball. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6835.52s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6837.52s)]
*  Defensive too, defensive minded. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6839.04s)]
*  They got to average more defensive three seconds than any team in the history of the NBA. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6841.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, once you, dare the referee to call it. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6846.240000000001s)]
*  Dare you to call it. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6848.8s)]
*  Really? [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6850.320000000001s)]
*  Why? [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6850.72s)]
*  Because they're just sitting in that paint. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6850.88s)]
*  Yeah, and the referee's, that's Pat Riley over there. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6852.0s)]
*  You think he intimidates even refs? [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6855.4400000000005s)]
*  For sure. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6857.12s)]
*  But refs get back at him too now. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6858.0s)]
*  Steve Javie, remember Steve Javie? [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6859.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6860.8s)]
*  We're in Cleveland. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6861.12s)]
*  We're on like a four or five game road trip. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6861.84s)]
*  Getting our asses handed to us. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6863.68s)]
*  It's like the second quarter, we're down 25 already. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6865.2s)]
*  Pat Riley gets a technical. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6868.4800000000005s)]
*  Two minutes later, he's trying to get another technical. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6870.400000000001s)]
*  Steve Javie comes over there anytime I say, hey Pat, [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6873.360000000001s)]
*  if I got to watch this bullshit tonight, so are you. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6876.400000000001s)]
*  You ain't getting kicked out tonight. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6879.28s)]
*  That's great. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6880.5599999999995s)]
*  That's great. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6882.96s)]
*  Wow. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6883.5199999999995s)]
*  I always say I want to write a book, but if I wrote a book, [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6884.88s)]
*  we ought to have to name names and stuff like that. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6886.8s)]
*  And that would take away my relationships with people and stuff like that. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6888.4s)]
*  Because I've got so many stories like I could tell, like you guys would love them, man. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6891.36s)]
*  Tell us, man. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6896.32s)]
*  Tell us. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6897.5199999999995s)]
*  I want to hear all of you. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6898.0s)]
*  I can't put my guys out. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6899.36s)]
*  You can take a name, man. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6901.679999999999s)]
*  We can bleep names. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6902.4s)]
*  We can bleep if it makes you feel uncomfortable. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6903.5199999999995s)]
*  I just love the information age we're living in. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6905.5199999999995s)]
*  Because you see there's so many guys that have played in the league, [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6908.08s)]
*  and they have these incredible fucking stories from what goes on. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6911.04s)]
*  But I think I'm a little different at most because I'm so infatuated. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6914.24s)]
*  Like I said earlier, I don't look at myself. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6918.88s)]
*  I get to sit down beside Gary Payton on a bus. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6920.8s)]
*  That's amazing to me. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6924.16s)]
*  I get to talk to Alonzo Mourning or Shaquille O'Neal or Dwayne Wade or [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6926.24s)]
*  get to try to guard Russell. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6930.96s)]
*  Like that's crazy to me. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6932.16s)]
*  I get to do that, bro. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6934.08s)]
*  I don't look at myself like I'm looking at them dudes. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6935.6s)]
*  Those dudes are like heroes to me, bro. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6938.8s)]
*  Alon Iverson. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6941.120000000001s)]
*  Like Alon Iverson give me that, bro. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6942.160000000001s)]
*  That's like what? [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6943.76s)]
*  Have you ever had imposter syndrome? [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6945.360000000001s)]
*  Like did you feel like you belonged in the league? [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6947.76s)]
*  Based on play, yeah. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6954.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, based on play. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6955.360000000001s)]
*  But like what I thought of the NBA and what I've heard of the NBA, [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6956.240000000001s)]
*  like I'm not like going to clubs and things like that. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6959.92s)]
*  I'm not against any of that, but that just wasn't my thing. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6964.24s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6967.04s)]
*  So that part of it I thought maybe I'd have maybe not fit in and maybe guys look sideways at me. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6967.599999999999s)]
*  But like I said earlier, once you get on the floor and you can hoop, bro, [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6973.28s)]
*  nobody cares what nothing is. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6976.719999999999s)]
*  What happened with GP? [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6978.4s)]
*  Did you guys ever have a convo about it? [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6980.08s)]
*  No, but I've been around the convo when it was happening. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6982.0s)]
*  It was uncomfortable. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6986.5599999999995s)]
*  The first one, you know. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6987.92s)]
*  Can you give us the breakdown? [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6989.04s)]
*  For sure. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6990.5599999999995s)]
*  I get traded to Miami and then they sign him in the off season too. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6991.84s)]
*  Well, the play. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6994.96s)]
*  I'm getting there. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6996.16s)]
*  So we're getting there. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=6998.24s)]
*  I'm coming to work out. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7001.12s)]
*  He's just getting done with his press conference because he just got, [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7001.92s)]
*  he just got, he signed there as a free agent. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7004.08s)]
*  He got on the freshest Air Force 1s too, like fresh. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7006.72s)]
*  I'm like, oh man, that's Gary Payton. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7011.2s)]
*  I'm getting like, whoa. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7013.28s)]
*  And I already got that in my pocket. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7014.56s)]
*  Is he feeling some type of way at me because I did that? [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7016.08s)]
*  Because he was talking so much shit to me that game. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7018.88s)]
*  Like, like I was terrified. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7021.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7025.04s)]
*  Like I'm not. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7025.28s)]
*  If you tell them what you did, can we tell the fans what you did? [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7026.08s)]
*  Just, just a refresher. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7028.88s)]
*  The move. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7030.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean, the cross. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7031.12s)]
*  I mean, well, I think that the, what does it even go one play back? [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7032.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7037.2s)]
*  What doesn't set that up is the one play before that. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7037.36s)]
*  I hit one from like Steph Curry range and Gary didn't step out. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7039.6s)]
*  No, he didn't step out. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7043.04s)]
*  He was just, yeah, he's just trying to keep me out of the paint, which got no chance. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7043.76s)]
*  And Gary Payton, the glove. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7047.68s)]

*  But they call me white boy. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7072.400000000001s)]
*  I knew what time it was with them because I done blew it down with them. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7073.76s)]
*  And we done, you know what I mean? [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7075.92s)]

*  You know what I mean? [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7083.2s)]
*  Like, I'm just hooping. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7083.68s)]
*  I don't want to do nothing. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7085.36s)]
*  You're my idol type shit. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7087.84s)]
*  Is he bringing up history? [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7089.12s)]
*  Is he talking about? [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7090.16s)]
*  Like wishing I would say something. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7092.48s)]
*  Really? [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7094.16s)]
*  And I could, like every time he says something or that or that, [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7095.28s)]
*  I'm just like, he's looking at me like, yeah, I wish you would. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7098.16s)]
*  That's like all other players playing in Boston. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7101.44s)]
*  Like the boy. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7107.12s)]
*  It's a whole lot of that. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7108.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7110.08s)]
*  So but C. Webb's taking my, he got my back. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7110.72s)]
*  He's talking for me, blah, blah, blah. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7112.56s)]
*  So C. Webb is talking back to you. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7113.84s)]
*  For sure. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7115.04s)]
*  Like, GPs like, yeah, I wish he would. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7115.6s)]
*  And then I hit that 30 footer. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7120.88s)]
*  And then next time come down and he had to step up. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7122.48s)]
*  And I didn't really notice that he tried to try. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7126.08s)]
*  I don't even know if he still, I don't, people say he tried to try. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7128.0s)]
*  So you're fake, you fake like you're going to pull up. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7130.16s)]
*  Fake like a little hezzy. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7132.08s)]
*  And then this really wasn't really like a big crossover. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7133.2s)]
*  Like Allen Iverson or anything like I would want to do. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7136.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7138.64s)]
*  It was just like a, and if I'm. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7139.04s)]
*  He bit on it hard. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7141.52s)]
*  If you just like leaning from that corner a little bit, [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7142.96s)]
*  if you just look your eyes, you're beat. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7145.84s)]
*  If I'm full speed, you're beat. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7148.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7149.68s)]
*  And he's kind of leaned that way and off I went that way. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7150.240000000001s)]
*  And he stuck his leg out. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7153.76s)]
*  He tried to trip you. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7154.8s)]
*  For sure. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7155.6s)]
*  He tried to trip me. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7156.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7156.72s)]
*  But GP, that's my guy. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7157.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7159.84s)]
*  I wasn't intentional. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7160.88s)]
*  I mean, it was. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7163.4400000000005s)]
*  You intentionally crossed the shape. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7164.0s)]
*  He was talking harsh to me. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7165.12s)]
*  So then you see him. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7168.8s)]
*  So we see him down there and we see him in that white. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7170.24s)]
*  I've seen him come out of his press conference. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7172.24s)]
*  I go and I'm like, I don't know how this is going to go, [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7173.92s)]
*  but I'm going to go show my love for sure. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7175.76s)]
*  That's respect or whatever. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7177.76s)]
*  And I go and I step on his Air Force one. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7178.96s)]
*  No, Jason. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7180.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7182.72s)]
*  Come on, bro. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7183.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7184.08s)]
*  That wasn't an accident. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7185.12s)]
*  I'm thinking for sure if he don't swing on me, his homie swinging. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7185.84s)]
*  So you kind of just played it off, blah, blah. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7189.76s)]
*  But then everything was cool there. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7192.0s)]
*  We get on the first road trip, something we brought up on the bus. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7193.68s)]
*  Who brings it up? [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7196.88s)]
*  You know it was Shaq. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7198.16s)]
*  GP took it like a man. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7203.84s)]
*  Oh, he's like, yeah, you know, everybody's going to get got, right? [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7204.96s)]

*  Lonzo morning is going to try to block every shot. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7209.68s)]
*  But he's going to get yammed on every one. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7211.76s)]
*  He's going to get yammed on every now, but he's going to block a lot of them. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7212.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7214.96s)]
*  You know, just ask Vince Carter. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7215.4400000000005s)]
*  But GP took it like a man. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7218.8s)]
*  Like, yeah, everybody gets got. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7220.0s)]
*  I'm sure there's other plays that GP got crossed up or beat on. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7221.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7227.04s)]
*  So just. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7227.599999999999s)]
*  I think it was GP's face afterwards also because it wasn't angry. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7228.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm going to go knock this kid out or something like that. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7234.08s)]
*  It was, all right. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7236.24s)]
*  I think that as like a fan watching, it's nice when there's like [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7239.68s)]
*  mutual respect against competitors. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7243.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7245.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7246.16s)]
*  Since that move, not one word has been said to me. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7247.44s)]
*  Really? [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7249.68s)]
*  That's my guy, though, to the end. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7250.8s)]
*  I was fortunate enough to have great teammates, but he ranks right up there. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7254.56s)]
*  Bro, like really fabulous dude, bro. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7257.360000000001s)]

*  Pull, bro. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7266.96s)]
*  Pull anything you're doing. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7267.92s)]
*  Flipping pennies, cards. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7269.6s)]
*  And he does everything left hand. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7271.52s)]
*  The only thing he does right hand is hoop. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7272.96s)]
*  Everything left handed. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7275.200000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7276.08s)]

*  That's interesting. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7278.08s)]
*  Gary Payton, man, one of the baddest dudes ever. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7279.360000000001s)]
*  Lace him up. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7281.2s)]
*  What about the games that you guys are playing outside of basketball? [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7282.400000000001s)]
*  So like, you know, you're on the bus, you're on the plane or whatever like that. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7285.92s)]
*  Is it cards? [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7289.52s)]
*  Like, what is everybody getting competitive about? [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7290.400000000001s)]
*  It depends. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7292.24s)]
*  You know, definitely a card game going on. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7292.72s)]
*  And what's the game? [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7294.72s)]
*  You know, it could be bourree here. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7296.0s)]
*  It could be, well, we call it in between like AC Doocy, where you flip up a card here [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7297.52s)]
*  and then flip up another card and then you bet how much money of the pot. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7303.12s)]
*  Well, the next one will be in between those. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7306.400000000001s)]
*  Hence in between. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7308.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7309.76s)]
*  But they'll put like six decks in there. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7311.28s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7313.68s)]
*  And when we got on the plane, we'd get an envelope full of per diem. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7314.24s)]
*  We went on an eight day trip. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7317.92s)]
*  It'd be a lot of money, right? [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7319.28s)]
*  Everybody just gambles the per diem. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7320.16s)]
*  Well, yeah, but the rookies, they throw that shit in there [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7321.68s)]
*  and then rookies lose that per diem. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7324.08s)]
*  Oh, boy, they want to jump out of the plane right away. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7325.52s)]
*  I never played in those games. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7330.72s)]
*  I'll be the dealer. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7331.84s)]
*  Oh, you didn't gamble. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7332.88s)]
*  I didn't gamble because I'm going to lose. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7333.84s)]
*  You don't really have any vices. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7336.320000000001s)]
*  Is that why I was frustrated when they were trying to put the weed thing on you? [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7338.4800000000005s)]
*  Because it's like, yo, I'm not partying. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7341.68s)]
*  I'm not chasing bitches. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7344.240000000001s)]
*  I'm not doing any of this stuff. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7345.68s)]
*  And I'm smoking a little weed. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7347.68s)]
*  And now I'm the drug guy. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7350.4800000000005s)]
*  And now I'm the bad guy who doesn't care about the rules. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7351.360000000001s)]
*  And it's not like it was performance enhancing. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7354.160000000001s)]
*  If anything, weed is the opposite, I'm thinking, right? [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7356.64s)]
*  With hoofs. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7358.64s)]
*  I'm thinking, what's worse than me smoking a blunt or Vladey smoking a motherfucking cigarette? [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7360.08s)]
*  He was smoking what? [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7367.36s)]
*  I'll be in his room. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7368.16s)]
*  Yeah, because he's smoking cigarettes. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7369.04s)]
*  That's going to mask the weed smell all day. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7370.32s)]
*  All day, come on down. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7373.92s)]
*  So you were helping him. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7376.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7377.44s)]
*  Like, Vladey's in the fourth quarter. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7377.92s)]
*  He's fucking throwing up kids. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7379.44s)]
*  And plus, he ordered a room service too because he got more bread than me. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7380.4800000000005s)]
*  So we put that on his room. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7384.16s)]
*  Is that a thought? [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7386.0s)]
*  Even though you're in the NBA, you're still money conscious a little bit? [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7388.0s)]
*  I mean, I think so. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7392.0s)]
*  I mean, if you're smart. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7393.28s)]
*  What's the rookie contract? [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7393.92s)]
*  What's the rookie contract? [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7394.8s)]
*  I think now like a lottery. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7395.6s)]
*  Yeah, you were. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7398.400000000001s)]
*  I don't know, probably. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7399.4400000000005s)]
*  Probably, let's see, five years at probably two, three, four, five, six. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7402.64s)]
*  And it was five years they would lock the rookies in? [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7409.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7412.160000000001s)]
*  And now it's what, three? [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7412.4800000000005s)]
*  With an option, right? [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7413.68s)]
*  Right. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7414.56s)]
*  Go, go. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7415.6s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7416.240000000001s)]
*  So they'd lock you in for five years. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7417.04s)]
*  Oh, so I mean, getting that first, getting a pick. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7418.96s)]
*  Oh man. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7422.88s)]
*  And he was a seven pick too, so he had a pretty good contract relative to the second round pick. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7423.6s)]
*  But I mean, you're completely changing franchise in two ways. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7427.68s)]
*  You can add vets and spend on vets. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7430.320000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7433.360000000001s)]
*  Kind of like a quarterback. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7433.92s)]
*  You get a rookie quarterback, you ain't got to have money. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7434.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7436.64s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7437.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7437.68s)]
*  Oh shit. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7438.08s)]
*  Okay, so you're thinking going into it because your agent's getting some, [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7438.64s)]
*  your manager's getting some, obviously, taxes. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7441.6s)]
*  You're sending some money back home. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7445.280000000001s)]
*  Just an agent, no manager. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7446.64s)]
*  Oh, you didn't have a manager? [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7448.0s)]
*  No, I had none of that bullshit. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7449.120000000001s)]
*  Really? [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7450.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7450.56s)]
*  And what does an agent take in? [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7450.8s)]
*  Mostly he can take four percent, but he's going to take up to what I tell him. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7452.24s)]
*  But I gave him four percent, I mean, fuck. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7455.2s)]
*  Right. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7456.719999999999s)]
*  Shit, you give me this, you take mine. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7457.36s)]
*  I can give you four percent. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7459.5199999999995s)]
*  Bro. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7461.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7462.48s)]
*  So you said no manager. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7462.719999999999s)]
*  But then like endorsement deals, he could take maybe, that's different, whatever y'all work out. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7463.28s)]
*  Right, right, because I heard endorsement sometimes it could be up to like 20% or something crazy. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7468.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7471.92s)]
*  Yo, did you get a Nike shoe? [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7472.24s)]
*  Was there a shoe coming up? [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7474.16s)]
*  That was another rumor. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7475.36s)]
*  You had a shoe? [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7476.16s)]
*  I don't know if it was, it wasn't actually my shoe. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7477.44s)]
*  I don't say so to speak, but they put me in it. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7479.84s)]
*  The hyper flight? [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7483.68s)]
*  Yeah, it wasn't for my foot. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7484.96s)]
*  Horrible. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7487.4400000000005s)]
*  For mine too. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7488.24s)]
*  Yeah, no support. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7489.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7491.2s)]
*  It felt like you were just in like an old pair of wrestling shoes. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7491.52s)]
*  Yeah, it was. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7493.6s)]
*  Right, yeah. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7494.64s)]
*  But they made you wear them? [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7495.76s)]
*  You had to? [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7496.64s)]
*  The purple ones, remember? [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7497.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7498.0s)]
*  And then back then when I played, your team had to wear all black or all white. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7498.400000000001s)]
*  It had to be 49, 51. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7502.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7504.96s)]
*  Like white. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7505.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7506.16s)]
*  Or you got fined. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7506.96s)]
*  I'm like, well, what are we going to do here? [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7508.24s)]
*  These are all purple. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7509.36s)]
*  The whole thing. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7510.32s)]
*  We'll pay the fine. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7511.28s)]
*  We'll pay the motherfucking fine. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7511.759999999999s)]
*  They did the Jordan shit. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7513.759999999999s)]
*  Okay, so there was never supposed to be a shoe that was yours. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7515.92s)]
*  That was the rumor. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7519.759999999999s)]
*  You were getting a shoe. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7520.48s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7521.5199999999995s)]
*  I never heard it. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7523.28s)]
*  I mean, Nike had you front and center on some of those commercials. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7524.4s)]
*  There's that shot of you running back down court, wooing. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7527.04s)]
*  It's just like I remember that. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7529.759999999999s)]
*  Also that one with the dribbling where they had the squeaking of the sneaker. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7530.4s)]
*  That guy really sat there and squeaked his sneakers on the floor to make it. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7534.24s)]
*  Yeah, bro. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7537.04s)]
*  It's crazy shit. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7538.4s)]
*  Wow. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7539.12s)]
*  What is the best sneaker? [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7540.0s)]
*  Today? [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7542.48s)]
*  Yeah, for you and your time. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7543.12s)]
*  Oh, man. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7544.16s)]
*  Them Kyries, bro. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7545.04s)]
*  You like the Kyries? [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7546.24s)]
*  You don't like the Kyries? [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7547.12s)]
*  Later on in my career, the LeBron, it was a favorite for me because right out of the box, [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7548.16s)]
*  it felt like I'd been wearing it for three weeks. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7553.759999999999s)]
*  It's so big. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7555.5199999999995s)]
*  It's such a, I figured you would want like a small, slim shoe. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7556.639999999999s)]
*  I had to put my orthotic in the shoe. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7560.5599999999995s)]
*  My orthotic was big and sturdy and hard. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7562.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7564.24s)]
*  So it didn't matter. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7564.799999999999s)]
*  I was quick as a hiccup, bro. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7566.48s)]
*  I was getting where I needed to go. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7568.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7569.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7570.32s)]
*  What are your thoughts on Kyries game? [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7572.24s)]
*  The best offensive package ever? [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7577.679999999999s)]
*  You think he's up there? [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7582.719999999999s)]
*  For sure he's up there. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7583.919999999999s)]
*  It'd be hard to put him at the best just because his jump shot's not like Steff. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7585.679999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7590.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7591.28s)]
*  But ball handling, he's the top as it gets for me. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7592.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7594.959999999999s)]
*  He's the best ball handler ever. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7595.36s)]
*  And why? [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7597.2s)]
*  Just because I think not only that he can handle the thing, [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7597.759999999999s)]
*  but he can get through cracks and crevices like no other. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7600.719999999999s)]
*  And then spin and then puts him above everybody. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7604.88s)]
*  Ball, he can finish at the rim with either hand. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7607.44s)]
*  The finishing ability is insane. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7609.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7611.599999999999s)]
*  That's just like, I don't think we'll ever see that again. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7612.24s)]
*  Not in our lifetime. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7614.799999999999s)]
*  It's hard to even compare him to somebody from a past generation. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7617.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm trying to think of like what that, it's not AI, [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7621.12s)]
*  because AI was blowing by you. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7623.92s)]
*  Right, he was just a crossover and gone. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7625.76s)]
*  And Kyrie can have you on his head. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7627.36s)]
*  Kyrie can have you spinning in circles and still stand right here, [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7629.28s)]
*  and then go by you when you turn back around. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7631.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7633.52s)]
*  And finish. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7634.0s)]
*  So why do you think that he struggles so much later in his career to win? [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7635.04s)]
*  I think mentally maybe. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7642.96s)]
*  I think it's just my opinion. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7644.08s)]
*  I think he's just trying to think, got too much shit going on in his mind. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7648.88s)]
*  Like back when he was 16, 17. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7652.56s)]
*  It was one thing basketball. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7655.36s)]
*  Killer, right? [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7656.72s)]
*  Just basketball. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7658.0s)]
*  And now I think, I mean, it's part of the job though, [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7659.28s)]
*  I think he feels maybe some pressure that he's got to take the Indian people or tribes [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7661.52s)]
*  or whatever he's dealing with. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7667.4400000000005s)]
*  He's got to put them on a map type shit. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7669.6s)]
*  Maybe he feels that. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7671.28s)]
*  He feels a social responsibility. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7672.16s)]
*  Maybe. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7673.6s)]
*  You got your championships, so that's awesome. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7673.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7676.16s)]
*  That's interesting. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7677.28s)]
*  Have you seen that with guys? [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7677.84s)]
*  You don't have to say names, but guys that were just so incredibly gifted, [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7678.64s)]
*  but mentally you just saw him break down. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7681.44s)]
*  For sure. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7683.2s)]
*  There's been so many like just right here in New York City, [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7683.599999999999s)]
*  how many guys like we're talking about Rucker Park earlier, [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7686.32s)]
*  how many guys come through Rucker Park that are way more talented than guys in the NBA [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7688.48s)]
*  that just can't do it, bro, mentally. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7692.48s)]
*  You know, I'm not even talking about the drugs or any of that. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7694.48s)]
*  Just like you put a referee out there that's going to call defense of three seconds [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7697.28s)]
*  or offense of three seconds. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7700.96s)]
*  Now this dude can't even play now. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7702.16s)]
*  Who is the most mentally impressive player you went, you played with and against? [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7703.679999999999s)]
*  For sure it's Kobe again. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7707.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I figured that. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7708.96s)]
*  Why? [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7710.639999999999s)]
*  Just because he's just so cerebral like all these game plans for start, [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7711.28s)]
*  like game plans are made for guys like that. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7716.16s)]
*  We're going to try to not stop this guy, just limit. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7718.8s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7721.92s)]
*  Like when we played the Spurs, you can't let Duncan get 30 [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7722.4800000000005s)]
*  and Parker get 25 and Gennobili get 25. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7726.88s)]
*  Just go ahead and let Duncan get 50 and try to keep Parker and Gennobili under 10. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7729.84s)]
*  Got a better chance of winning that way because of all three of them getting 20 and 30, [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7734.64s)]
*  you're getting your head drugged. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7737.84s)]
*  And you're not going to clog that link. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7738.8s)]
*  So it's like Kobe was like, so we put these game plans for guys like that [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7742.400000000001s)]
*  and Kobe specifically like the fourth or fifth possession, [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7747.360000000001s)]
*  the game plan is out the window. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7753.12s)]
*  He's done figured a bitch out. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7754.400000000001s)]
*  He done figured it out, man. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7756.56s)]
*  Like these guys are too good. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7757.84s)]
*  He doesn't watch too much film. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7760.72s)]
*  Kobe's done seen every defensive scheme we're going to throw at him. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7762.64s)]
*  More than we've worked on it because he's watched more film than we've worked on it. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7766.88s)]
*  And everybody's trying to throw it at him. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7769.6s)]
*  Everybody. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7771.2s)]
*  He's done seen every type of defense, every type of pick and roll coverage. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7772.0s)]
*  He's done figured out the best way. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7776.4800000000005s)]
*  And I think guys like that just learn to be patient in the first quarter. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7779.04s)]
*  Yeah, we're going to come off this pick and roll. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7782.16s)]
*  We're going to pick you apart with Shaq. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7783.52s)]
*  Shaq's got 30 in the first half. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7785.04s)]
*  Who's going to get all the points in the second half? [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7787.36s)]
*  Shaq going to be double team. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7789.04s)]
*  Now Kobe's getting all the looks. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7789.92s)]
*  So guys like that are just on, there's levels to everything, bro. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7792.4800000000005s)]
*  In the NBA, you got a level here and then you got guys like Kobe and guys like that are just. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7796.96s)]
*  Best you've ever played against? [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7801.2s)]
*  The best player I've ever played against is LeBron James. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7802.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I was wondering about that. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7805.5199999999995s)]
*  I played against Jordan back when he played for the Wizards. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7806.24s)]
*  What was that like? [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7808.96s)]
*  It was great. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7809.84s)]
*  I mean, everybody says it was back in the old days or at the end of his career where [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7810.32s)]
*  the bitch had 31 at halftime. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7815.44s)]
*  It's old in my ass. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7816.88s)]
*  I'm glad I didn't get none of them bulls days, bro. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7819.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7822.08s)]
*  But just being on the court with him. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7823.76s)]
*  Oh, it's unbelievable. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7825.12s)]
*  He has a golf course down in Hope Sound, Florida. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7826.88s)]
*  I'm fortunate to get to play there a lot. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7829.76s)]
*  Oh, really? [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7831.76s)]
*  You play with Mike? [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7832.56s)]
*  Never play with him, but every time I go there, that's the only thing I want to do is see Mike. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7833.76s)]
*  I could be on the first green and I'm like, where's Mike? [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7839.04s)]
*  And Mike is so different looking. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7841.84s)]
*  I can see Mike from way, way over there. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7844.8s)]
*  Like, oh yeah, there's Mike. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7846.88s)]
*  I catch myself gazing. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7848.8s)]
*  The first time I shook his hand, the first time at the golf course. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7852.4800000000005s)]
*  He was like, Jay Will, what's up? [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7856.4800000000005s)]
*  Shake my hand. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7857.76s)]
*  And I was like, he was like, yeah. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7859.040000000001s)]
*  I don't want to let go. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7862.080000000001s)]
*  I'm looking dead in his eyes. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7862.88s)]
*  I can just feel him like, bro, let go of my hand. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7864.240000000001s)]
*  He just has that effect on me. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7869.200000000001s)]
*  Like, it's just like, that's Michael Jordan. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7870.64s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7873.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7873.76s)]
*  Wow. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7874.160000000001s)]
*  What do you think Mike's competitive edge was? [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7874.8s)]
*  People talk a lot about skill. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7878.72s)]
*  They talk a lot about shooting ability. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7882.240000000001s)]
*  But is there a thing specifically that you thought set him aside? [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7886.0s)]
*  Just wanted to win, man. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7889.679999999999s)]
*  He didn't care. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7891.679999999999s)]
*  And that's easy for me to say that he didn't care. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7893.44s)]
*  But at the end of the day, he's going to have a huge say in that win. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7895.12s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7898.08s)]
*  It's like, it's kind of arguing like when you argue the LeBron and Jordan thing. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7898.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7902.08s)]
*  You say LeBron's a better basketball player or, you know, well, MJ wasn't a good teammate. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7902.72s)]
*  He didn't make the extra pass, but he won the goddamn game. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7908.72s)]
*  He won the goddamn game. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7911.04s)]
*  So how can you argue that? [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7911.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7912.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I heard it was like, I heard someone say this, that he can lock in 100% for any game. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7913.52s)]
*  For sure. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7920.400000000001s)]
*  It doesn't matter what it is. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7920.96s)]
*  It's like it could be game 43 of the season. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7921.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7924.0s)]
*  But, and I imagine game 43, sometimes it's hard to lock in 100%. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7924.64s)]
*  For sure. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7929.92s)]
*  You're beat up, your knees are sore, all these things. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7930.32s)]
*  It's easy to take a little bit off, but MJ could lock in. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7932.16s)]
*  That's why he's one of the greatest, if not the greatest. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7935.28s)]
*  Who's your? [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7938.4800000000005s)]
*  Whatever, yeah, LeBron, I want to hear about him. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7940.0s)]
*  Yeah, a quick story about Bob Knight. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7941.68s)]
*  I just heard this yesterday. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7943.92s)]
*  Of course. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7944.72s)]
*  Rest in soul, rest in soul. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7945.280000000001s)]
*  He told me a story about Jordan, or I saw the story about Jordan. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7946.56s)]
*  He said they were playing in the Olympic. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7949.68s)]
*  He was the last guy to coach a basketball team from America to win a gold medal that [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7951.52s)]
*  didn't have professionals. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7959.360000000001s)]
*  Professionals, yeah. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7960.16s)]
*  Right? [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7960.64s)]
*  So they're at halftime and they're playing, I forget who they're playing, and he's saying [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7961.52s)]
*  they're up 29 points, USA. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7964.64s)]
*  And Bob Knight's walking across the court to go in the locker room at halftime. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7966.8s)]
*  He's like, what am I going to say to these guys to get them going? [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7970.88s)]
*  They did everything right. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7974.64s)]
*  What am I going to say? [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7975.92s)]
*  And he grabbed a stat sheet as he walked across. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7977.36s)]
*  He said Jordan. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7979.28s)]
*  He saw Jordan's name. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7980.0s)]
*  Jordan played 12 minutes in the first half. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7981.36s)]
*  He had 19 points. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7983.76s)]
*  He had 11 rebounds and nine assists in 12 minutes in the first half. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7985.28s)]
*  And he's thinking, what am I going to say? [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7989.92s)]
*  He said, I got it. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7991.2s)]
*  As soon as I opened the door, I see Michael Jordan's the first one. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7992.32s)]
*  So what do I do? [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7995.04s)]
*  I said, God damn it, MJ, what are you doing? [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7996.32s)]
*  Are you going to set any screens tonight? [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=7999.4400000000005s)]
*  I haven't seen you set one damn screen tonight. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8001.200000000001s)]
*  And he said, MJ looked up with a little grin, not a big one. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8003.6s)]
*  He said, coach, you remember last week when you told the whole world [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8007.92s)]
*  that I was the quickest person you've ever seen on the basketball floor? [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8011.200000000001s)]
*  He said, I'm setting them so quick you don't even see me. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8014.08s)]
*  I thought that was a good story. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8018.96s)]
*  Fucking legend. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8020.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8020.8s)]
*  Bob Knight was a legend. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8021.52s)]
*  Yeah, Knight was. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8022.8s)]
*  I heard there was the Phil Jackson story. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8023.84s)]
*  I think it was Mike. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8025.76s)]
*  He said, Mike, you know, there's no I in team. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8026.72s)]
*  And Jordan goes, there's one and win. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8028.8s)]
*  That's right. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8030.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8030.56s)]
*  Michael Jordan was just different. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8031.68s)]
*  You see how that wasn't that bad for me? [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8035.360000000001s)]
*  Some of you guys put different substances in your hand. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8037.2s)]
*  I can't use the name because of YouTube rules. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8040.320000000001s)]
*  Those are bad for you. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8042.320000000001s)]
*  And if you want to quit those, instead of quitting completely cold turkey, [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8043.360000000001s)]
*  why don't you just replace that product with something else? [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8047.52s)]
*  And that is where Fume comes in. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8051.6s)]
*  Fume is an innovative, award winning flavored air device. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8053.599999999999s)]

*  And they have a new product called the Solano Fume. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8080.24s)]

*  Was there ever an arena or a venue that you played at that was really special? [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8192.0s)]
*  Like the first time you ever played at like the Staples Center or the Garden or something [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8195.68s)]
*  like that? [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8199.119999999999s)]
*  Arco Arena for sure, man. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8199.6s)]
*  They had the best fans ever. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8201.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8202.32s)]
*  Cowbells. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8202.800000000001s)]
*  I'm biased. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8203.2s)]
*  Yeah, the Cowbells and all that stuff that was loud. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8204.08s)]
*  And we were the only thing going there. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8206.4s)]
*  We could lose 12 in a row and they're selling out the next game. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8207.6s)]
*  But the special gyms to me were like Old Seattle Arena, Phoenix's Arena. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8211.84s)]
*  I just always shot good there. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8218.24s)]
*  So that's why I'm choosing these. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8219.36s)]
*  And did it make a difference like that physical space that you were in? [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8221.76s)]
*  Like the actual arena makes a difference in the game? [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8224.16s)]
*  For sure. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8226.08s)]
*  Like the backdrop and things like that. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8226.560000000001s)]
*  Early on in my career, once like I think after my first year, you get used to the [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8228.32s)]
*  background, but there's nothing like playing at Madison Square Garden. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8232.16s)]
*  I didn't know nothing about the circus animals that they kept in there. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8235.199999999999s)]
*  I didn't know that there were I didn't even know there were different players. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8240.4s)]
*  We don't call them that, Jason. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8243.76s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8249.039999999999s)]
*  They do some filthy things. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8249.6s)]
*  But Madison Square Garden is like, you know, it's dark. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8254.88s)]
*  You can't even see like the third row up. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8257.36s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8258.800000000001s)]
*  So I think that's cool with all the lights on the floor. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8259.12s)]
*  You hear that bitch. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8260.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8261.6s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8261.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8262.24s)]
*  It's just a good spot. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8262.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8263.68s)]
*  Did you ever get nervous before games? [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8264.0s)]
*  I think. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8266.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I got nervous for every game, I think. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8267.28s)]
*  But I think it's in a good way. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8269.12s)]
*  Like soon as the jump, whoever controls the tip, the nerves are gone. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8271.28s)]
*  Right? [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8274.24s)]
*  I mean, it's just whooping. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8274.480000000001s)]
*  But there's never a game that you're sitting in a locker room just like, fuck. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8276.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8278.720000000001s)]
*  Every night I had to guard these motherfuckers. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8279.12s)]
*  Really? [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8280.960000000001s)]
*  I'm not like nervous. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8281.76s)]
*  It's like, man, this is about to suck. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8282.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8285.04s)]
*  But it's fitting to suck for them too. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8285.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8287.2s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8287.68s)]
*  What about finals? [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8288.24s)]
*  Was GP really supportive of you during that final? [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8289.84s)]
*  For sure. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8291.92s)]
*  Well, like I said earlier, man. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8292.400000000001s)]
*  He's competitive too. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8293.44s)]
*  You know he wants it. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8294.400000000001s)]
*  He hit a big shot in that final too. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8296.320000000002s)]
*  I think it was game three. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8297.76s)]
*  That's the one I remember. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8299.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8300.16s)]
*  That's the one that broke. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8300.720000000001s)]
*  I told him, I said, look, GP, look, D Wade ain't going to be open. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8301.28s)]
*  This is for D Wade. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8304.480000000001s)]
*  And you know Shaq not going to be. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8305.76s)]
*  I'm not fitting to throw to Shaq anyway because it might have been late in the game. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8306.800000000001s)]
*  He might have to free throws. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8309.04s)]
*  Right. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8310.16s)]
*  So you told him he's getting the rock? [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8310.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because the way that was spread out, GP's man was over there by D Wade's and they're [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8312.0s)]
*  shading to D Wade. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8315.68s)]
*  I said, look, if I throw you, and I was always the kind of guy, if I throw you a crisp pass [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8317.36s)]
*  in the air, you're open to shoot it. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8322.72s)]
*  You know that. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8324.96s)]
*  But if I throw you like a bounce pass, maybe a slower one or maybe kind of behind you, [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8325.68s)]
*  then you got to realize that the defense is, you got to do something once you get it. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8330.4s)]
*  It ain't like a catch and shoot type thing. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8333.92s)]
*  But if you get a crisp one from me, you got plenty of time. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8335.6s)]
*  Hoisted. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8338.24s)]
*  Right. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8339.04s)]
*  And I was always the kind of guy too, like JJ Reddick, for instance, he wanted to, he [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8339.6s)]
*  definitely shot the ball better when he caught the ball seams. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8343.76s)]
*  As opposed to catching it, he has to flip the seams before he shoots. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8346.960000000001s)]
*  Would you find out? [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8349.6s)]
*  I'm catching that ball and as I'm catching it from you, I'm turning the seams here. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8350.720000000001s)]
*  To set them up. [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8354.960000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8355.52s)]
*  So are you finding out how each guy likes to shoot the ball and then delivering it that way? [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8356.16s)]
*  Well, I'm finding out, but not in the way I want to find out. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8361.36s)]
*  But I'm a guy, I'm trying to get assists. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8366.48s)]
*  I'm thinking more assists, I'm getting more money I'm going to make. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8368.0s)]
*  So you're changing the seams on the ball. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8371.36s)]
*  I got to for some guys. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8372.8s)]
*  What you mean in the way you found out? [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8374.56s)]
*  Like yelling at me, like, I'm two for seven. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8376.48s)]
*  What you mean? [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8381.28s)]
*  He said, well, the third and fourth pass, the seams came sideways. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8382.08s)]
*  I need to remember that. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8386.08s)]
*  I think I saw some of you saying that like you're trying to deliver it [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8387.6s)]
*  for certain guys, you're trying to deliver on the side they're going to shoot. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8391.28s)]
*  So there's less movement. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8394.24s)]
*  Like Steph Curry, I think what sets him apart other than making the bitch, [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8396.16s)]
*  he's doing all this shit with the ball and he's got the ball here. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8399.2s)]
*  He can get it from here to here and off so fast. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8402.48s)]
*  Yeah, where certain guys, they need it. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8407.44s)]
*  Like JJ is knocked down, but he needs it right here. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8409.12s)]
*  And JJ is what, six four? [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8412.16s)]
*  He usually got a six, seven, six, eight guy. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8413.6s)]
*  If he's got a flick, not open no more, he might have to put it on the floor. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8415.84s)]
*  Yeah, the margins are so slim. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8421.04s)]
*  Yeah, Matt Bonner, remember Matt Bonner, the redhead? [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8422.24s)]
*  Oh, I thought he said Matt Barnes. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8426.48s)]
*  No, Matt Bonner. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8427.84s)]
*  The red mamba. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8430.16s)]
*  Yeah, he would, he is catching shoot percentage when he played for the Spurs. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8431.04s)]
*  One year was like 60%. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8435.44s)]
*  If you made him put it on the floor one time, shit went down to like 17%. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8437.84s)]
*  Get that fucking rock on the floor. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8442.720000000001s)]
*  Yes, make him dribble. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8444.560000000001s)]
*  Back then, now there's probably analytics guys getting you this. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8446.560000000001s)]
*  Back then they're just yelling at you and that's how you're learning. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8448.880000000001s)]
*  Right, but guys like Shane Baddie, Bruce Bowen, Doug Christie. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8450.800000000001s)]
*  These guys are looking at all this stuff. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8455.439999999999s)]
*  You ever ask Shane Baddie why his scalp looks like that? [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8456.88s)]
*  No, Shane Baddie is a great dude. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8460.24s)]
*  He's an amazing dude, but he has a little vagina. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8464.4s)]
*  Like band-aids type shit. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8468.96s)]
*  He'd be a good guy for your show, bro. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8471.199999999999s)]
*  I would love to have him on. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8472.72s)]
*  Yeah, he'd be a good guy. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8474.16s)]
*  But I used to sit beside him when I played with him in Memphis. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8475.119999999999s)]
*  He would play Jeopardy on the computer, right? [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8477.759999999998s)]
*  I'm trying to play against him. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8479.599999999999s)]
*  But hey, you don't have to be ready to answer. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8481.119999999999s)]
*  He'd answer it before I'd read the question. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8483.36s)]
*  So I'm like, no, this ain't gonna work. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8485.76s)]
*  God, that's so funny. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8487.44s)]
*  Everybody else is playing in between and he's playing Jeopardy. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8488.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah, just a different level. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8490.880000000001s)]
*  And looking at how many times Kobe goes right. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8492.400000000001s)]
*  He's really trying to break it down. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8496.800000000001s)]
*  Oh, he doesn't know how many times. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8498.0s)]
*  If Kobe dribbles twice to the left, he's gonna pull up this way. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8498.720000000001s)]
*  Or if I force him right, two, three dribbles, he's gonna spin. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8501.84s)]
*  Every time he takes three dribbles to the right, he spins back. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8505.44s)]
*  Yeah, he's that deep. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8508.480000000001s)]
*  Well, don't they call him the no points all-star? [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8509.36s)]
*  Wasn't that his name? [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8510.960000000001s)]
*  Shane Baddie? [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8511.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8512.08s)]
*  That's the New York Times article written about him. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8513.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8514.8s)]
*  Apparently when he's on the court, everyone scores more points. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8515.92s)]
*  The whole team goes up and when he's off, it's going down. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8519.439999999999s)]
*  He's one of those guys that affects the game. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8521.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but his individual scoring stats weren't amazing. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8522.64s)]
*  No. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8524.96s)]
*  And he was that dude at Duke. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8525.92s)]
*  Yeah, he was. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8527.199999999999s)]
*  The guy. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8527.84s)]
*  Charges and all that, yeah. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8528.32s)]
*  Okay, two things. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8530.4s)]
*  Have you found it hard for guys to transition from being the superstar their whole life [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8532.4s)]
*  to role players in the league? [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8538.64s)]
*  That's a tough question too. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8543.439999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's hard because I don't know who was stars. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8544.64s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8548.4s)]
*  What? [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8548.8s)]
*  Like, what? [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8548.96s)]
*  Aren't most guys stars? [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8549.439999999999s)]
*  Isn't everybody in the NBA when they were in high school, they were? [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8551.359999999999s)]
*  Patrick Beverly was dropping 50 a game when he was in high school. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8554.48s)]
*  Right, but when you say star, did you know Patrick Beverly in high school? [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8557.679999999998s)]
*  Okay, that's fair. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8560.64s)]
*  That's fair. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8561.359999999999s)]
*  You're a local. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8561.759999999998s)]
*  Yeah, maybe, yeah. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8562.72s)]
*  I think all of us are probably all local stars. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8563.439999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8565.359999999999s)]
*  And I think those guys like myself and Pat Beverly's of the world know who, you know, [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8565.92s)]
*  there's levels to everything. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8572.96s)]
*  I just admire those guys who are able, like Pat is a perfect example. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8574.32s)]
*  He was able to transition his game to what could create a very long career in the NBA. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8577.599999999999s)]
*  And I feel like there's certain guys that maybe they can't do that as effectively. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8585.439999999999s)]
*  For sure, there's guys like that. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8590.24s)]
*  But I try to tell kids all the time today, like, everybody can't score 25, 30 points a night, [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8592.08s)]
*  right? [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8597.519999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8597.679999999998s)]
*  So like Steven Adams, prime example. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8598.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8600.48s)]
*  Can't score for nothing. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8600.8s)]
*  But he's going to be in the league as long as he wants to. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8602.08s)]
*  And guess what? [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8604.0s)]
*  He signed a hundred million dollar deal for rebounding and setting screens, playing D, [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8604.4s)]
*  bro. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8608.4s)]
*  And you probably love playing with a guy like that. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8608.56s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8610.08s)]
*  Especially if you're one of like the Kobe or LeBron kind of guys, want them kind of guys all day. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8610.72s)]
*  Russell Westbrook loves them. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8615.44s)]
*  Like you asked Steph Curry and Clay Thompson if they want to play without Draymond Green. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8616.4s)]
*  They can say hell no. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8619.84s)]
*  Hell no. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8620.56s)]
*  Chance of defense. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8621.12s)]
*  As soon as one of them leaves, that's just done. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8622.56s)]
*  Really? [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8624.8s)]
*  I think if Draymond Green left there, they're not winning no more. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8625.28s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8628.64s)]
*  If Steph Curry left there, they're not winning no more. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8628.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8630.4s)]
*  And St. Ghost for Clay Thompson. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8630.96s)]
*  Right? [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8632.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8633.039999999999s)]
*  So you brought up LeBron. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8633.439999999999s)]
*  Why was he the best you've ever played against? [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8634.48s)]
*  I think LeBron's the best because he just makes everybody around him so much better. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8636.0s)]
*  Where it gets back to the point where, well, Jordan won the game. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8643.279999999999s)]
*  Right? [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8646.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8646.88s)]
*  So how you argue that. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8647.199999999999s)]
*  But my point like Jordan, like LeBron, when he at the end of the game, he's got the last [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8647.919999999998s)]
*  second shot and he penetrates or whatever and he's got three guys on him, he passes the ball. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8653.599999999999s)]
*  Right? [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8657.359999999999s)]
*  That's what you're supposed to do. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8657.759999999998s)]
*  And Jordan's just rising up and shooting and making it. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8659.199999999999s)]
*  Right? [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8662.16s)]
*  Well, back then, it was like the defense was different. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8662.96s)]
*  Like when Jordan caught the ball in the wing, it was just him and the primary defender. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8665.599999999999s)]
*  Next thing is the goal. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8669.039999999999s)]
*  Right? [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8670.64s)]
*  Where now LeBron gets the ball in the wing, got the primary defender. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8670.8s)]
*  You got the weak side block, slides over the ball side block, and you got a guy at the elbow. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8674.48s)]
*  So LeBron sees three guys. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8679.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8680.56s)]
*  So passing makes more sense than it would back in the day. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8681.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8684.0s)]
*  I just think LeBron could lead the league in all five major statistical categories. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8684.16s)]
*  Blocks, rebounds, sys, points, all that if he wanted to. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8690.16s)]
*  Where I don't know if MJ could have done that. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8693.6s)]
*  Because he did. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8696.16s)]
*  Not saying he couldn't have, but the mentality that he had, he was just going to [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8696.72s)]
*  get on my back and let's go. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8700.64s)]
*  I'm good. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8701.76s)]
*  Get there. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8702.16s)]
*  You know, people say I probably put Jordan above LeBron, but when LeBron left all three [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8702.64s)]
*  of his teams, they never made the playoffs. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8707.36s)]
*  When Jordan, his first year when he was playing baseball, the Bulls still made it to the [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8708.96s)]
*  conference semis, I think. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8712.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8713.6s)]
*  I think they lost to the Knicks in six or seven. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8713.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8715.68s)]
*  Check it out. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8716.0s)]
*  Jordan always played with, I'm not taking nothing from Michael Jordan. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8716.48s)]
*  Of course. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8719.6s)]
*  Pippen. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8720.960000000001s)]
*  Yep. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8721.52s)]
*  Horace Grant. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8722.8s)]
*  Yeah, Horace Grant was bad. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8723.36s)]
*  Dennis Rodman. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8724.4s)]
*  Tony Cucco. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8726.960000000001s)]
*  Cucco was nice. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8727.68s)]
*  And oh, by the way, Phil Jackson. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8728.72s)]
*  Oh, that guy Phil, yeah. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8730.16s)]
*  LeBron Hootie take to when the Cavs, Booby Gibson. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8731.92s)]
*  Andy Varigeau. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8737.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8738.16s)]
*  Good players. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8738.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8739.12s)]
*  Good players, but they're not Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman, right? [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8739.6s)]
*  Mo Williams. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8743.439999999999s)]
*  Great player. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8744.32s)]

*  But come on. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8745.519999999999s)]
*  I think you could put LeBron on any roster in the NBA right now, just put him in there, [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8746.48s)]
*  they get to the playoffs. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8751.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8752.32s)]

*  Even the Rag Glass Magix organization. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8753.439999999999s)]
*  We'll take him. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8756.72s)]
*  Yeah, I'll take him too. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8757.599999999999s)]
*  And Bronny too, come on. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8759.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8760.48s)]
*  Come on down, man. [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8761.039999999999s)]
*  Post-career. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8762.16s)]
*  How difficult is it going from every single day of your life is dominated by playing basketball [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8763.92s)]
*  to no longer playing professionally? [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8770.72s)]
*  Yes, it's tough. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8774.960000000001s)]
*  I'm still going through it a little bit. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8776.48s)]
*  Are you? [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8777.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'm just so bored with my life. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8778.08s)]
*  I can only golf so much. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8779.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8781.12s)]
*  I guess my kids were younger when I first retired. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8782.48s)]
*  I got three kids, one's 22, one's 19, one's 15. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8785.84s)]
*  So back then it was okay because they always had something to do. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8789.6s)]
*  But now it's like, it's just me and my wife and my youngest daughter. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8792.16s)]
*  So I'm always looking for something to do. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8795.2s)]
*  I wish I had something that I felt like... [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8797.44s)]
*  The same passion and love? [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8801.68s)]
*  Yeah, so it's going to have to be basketball, what? [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8802.960000000001s)]
*  Like a developmental coach or something like that? [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8804.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8806.560000000001s)]
*  Like as a head coach, some people are like, [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8806.960000000001s)]
*  why don't you coach high school basketball, things like that? [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8808.560000000001s)]
*  I couldn't do that. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8811.44s)]
*  The responsibility is too high for me. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8812.16s)]
*  I'm not the most responsible guy, but to help, to be an assistant, [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8813.92s)]
*  whereas I didn't have to show up every day, things like that, I could dig. [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8818.960000000001s)]
*  But where can you find that at, right? [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8822.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8824.08s)]
*  But I think it's tough. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8825.12s)]
*  You know, like you got to find something. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8826.0s)]
*  Like I found golf, I love golf. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8828.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8829.68s)]
*  But like I said, I can only golf so much. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8830.0s)]
*  I wish I could just be in the ears of some of these young kids [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8832.48s)]
*  and tell them my perspective of that pick and roll coverage that you just messed up. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8835.44s)]
*  I think some of these coaches are like always just hounding, hounding like, [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8842.4s)]
*  what'd you do? [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8845.04s)]
*  You did this wrong, you did this wrong. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8845.6s)]
*  Well, tell me, I want to know like, why'd you do that? [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8846.8s)]
*  Why did you go into the pick and roll at that time? [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8850.4s)]
*  Because I was the same way. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8852.96s)]
*  Let me explain to you why I did that because you might find like, oh, that might work, [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8855.84s)]
*  but it might not work for Kobe or might not work for Jason Kidd. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8859.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8862.880000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8863.12s)]
*  Just like Pat Riley was cool with that. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8863.6s)]
*  QB Brown was good about that. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8865.6s)]
*  I played with some coaches just like, nah. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8868.0s)]
*  This is how it's called. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8869.92s)]
*  Call red, we're going red. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8870.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8871.76s)]
*  So it's obviously a tough transition. [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8872.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, from the outside perspective, and again, like I've only seen you on social media and stuff, [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8875.44s)]
*  but it's felt like you really were spending time with family, obviously trying to find [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8880.0s)]
*  other things to distract you, be a golf or whatever. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8886.64s)]
*  Sometimes you see people kind of act out or they party or they drink. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8890.48s)]
*  They're kind of like holding on to the last semblance of like that fame. [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8894.96s)]
*  But it seems to me it's not the fame that you miss. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8899.36s)]
*  It's just like the being passionate about a thing. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8901.52s)]
*  See, I don't miss the fame because I didn't even see the fame. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8904.8s)]
*  You feel me? [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8908.64s)]
*  Like I'm still living my life the same way I did when I was hooping. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8909.039999999999s)]
*  I'm just not hooping. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8912.8s)]
*  I'm still going home and doing what I do, messing with the kids, whoever's at the house or whatnot. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8914.56s)]
*  I'm the type of dude, I just want to have a good time and laugh, bro. [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8919.68s)]
*  Even if it's at my expense, if you're laughing at me, bro, tell me. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8922.96s)]
*  I want to laugh with you. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8925.84s)]
*  Just be ready. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8926.64s)]
*  So like when I go golfing and I'm fortunate enough to play a lot of good golf courses [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8927.76s)]
*  where I have caddies and things like that, it's more important for me for that caddy [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8931.199999999999s)]
*  to have just as good, if not a better day on that golf course as me. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8936.08s)]
*  Just because if I'm an asshole to you and you're an asshole to me, [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8939.36s)]
*  now we got to spend four hours together. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8943.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8944.56s)]
*  We're not gonna have no fun, bro. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8944.8s)]
*  You're still giving. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8945.76s)]
*  Yeah, bro. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8947.44s)]
*  I just want to have a good time, man. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8948.0s)]
*  But I still want to whoop your ass at golf, you know, stuff like that. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8950.08s)]
*  But laughing is more important to me. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8952.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8954.56s)]
*  How's the knee though? [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8955.039999999999s)]
*  Can you get back on the court? [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8955.76s)]
*  My knee is okay. [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8956.88s)]
*  I could probably get back on the court if I did a little working out. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8957.76s)]
*  Probably like give me a month. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8960.8s)]
*  But I ain't trying to get sore and shit like that. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8962.4s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8964.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8965.28s)]
*  You ever go back to Bell? [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8965.92s)]
*  I go back to Bell. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8967.04s)]
*  I was just in West Virginia not too long ago doing a little autograph signing for the [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8968.32s)]
*  kids and things there. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8971.36s)]
*  I try to get back one weekend out of the summer to do a camp for the kids, man. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8972.08s)]
*  Because West Virginia is tough, not much going on there. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8975.6s)]
*  And when I was living there, it was probably the same. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8978.800000000001s)]
*  But looking back, man, Bell West Virginia was the greatest thing ever [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8981.92s)]
*  to me when I was living there. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8985.52s)]
*  It'd be hard to go back and move there. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8987.76s)]
*  But going back and giving back to the kids and things like that is priceless. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8990.4s)]
*  Do you think that contributed to your humility growing up in a place like that? [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8994.08s)]
*  That's like a small town where the people are humble? [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=8997.52s)]
*  I don't know whether to say yes or no. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=9001.44s)]
*  What I want to say is I've been like this my whole life no matter what. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=9003.68s)]
*  You guys put your pants on the same way I do and so does everybody else. [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=9008.64s)]
*  So just because I hooped and sold a jersey or two or like that or took a picture with [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=9011.76s)]
*  somebody, that didn't make me no better than anybody else, man. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=9017.039999999999s)]
*  So at the end of the day, when I leave out of here, I just hope you guys will be [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=9019.6s)]
*  yeah, he was a cool dude or your homies ask you about how was J. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=9024.48s)]
*  Will. I heard he was an asshole. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=9026.88s)]
*  Nah, bro, it was a total opposite of that. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=9028.8s)]
*  That's the only thing that I worry about in my life from here going forward. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=9030.88s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=9034.48s)]
*  They're like just a cool dude, man. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=9034.960000000001s)]
*  Any interest in doing TV? [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=9037.12s)]
*  No, because I can't be real. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=9041.28s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=9043.28s)]
*  It was like I'm authentic and I ain't going to say what a producer wants me to say. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=9043.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=9052.32s)]
*  Now, I might touch up on that. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=9052.88s)]
*  Yeah, but I got to say how I feel. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=9054.48s)]
*  You don't think that they would let you do what you did here? [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=9056.32s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=9061.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you're not that mean of a guy. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=9061.759999999998s)]

*  Ace. [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=9669.1s)]
*  Go ahead, flip it up. [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=9669.5s)]

*  Yep. [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=9672.54s)]
*  Knowing these are aces, pick one of these rows. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=9673.04s)]
*  Okay. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=9683.92s)]

*  Switch places. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=9691.2s)]
*  And then tap these three aces. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=9692.960000000001s)]
*  And they all moved over there with that one. [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=9695.04s)]
*  Okay. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=9697.12s)]

*  I didn't realize he was good. [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=9704.58s)]

*  And that's making me even more mad because I'm like... [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10210.84s)]
*  I'd rather them curse me back. [[02:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10214.039999999999s)]
*  Like, you know what I mean? [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10215.32s)]
*  But they're just smiling. [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10215.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10216.92s)]
*  I'm just steady, man. [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10217.4s)]
*  All right, cool. [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10221.56s)]
*  So I'm like, we call it time out of what I saw. [[02:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10222.039999999999s)]
*  I said, look, you just go down there. [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10223.72s)]
*  You just stand there and stand right there. [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10225.56s)]
*  Set this screen. [[02:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10227.56s)]
*  And I'm going to run as fast as I can [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10228.44s)]
*  and run my defender right off your screen. [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10230.92s)]
*  Right? [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10233.0s)]
*  I said, they're probably going to call offensive foul. [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10233.4s)]
*  Don't even worry about it because you know what time it is. [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10235.24s)]
*  They're cheating, right? [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10237.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10237.8s)]
*  Boom, we did it. [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10238.28s)]
*  Sure enough, offensive foul. [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10239.0s)]
*  I told him, I said, listen, don't do anything crazy [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10242.2s)]
*  after he calls the offensive foul. [[02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10244.76s)]
*  Right? [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10246.36s)]
*  And sure enough, he said, OK, no problem. [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10246.92s)]
*  So as soon as they call offensive foul, my dumb ass boots this ball. [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10248.44s)]
*  I mean, I kick the ball. [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10252.039999999999s)]
*  I try to kick it up as far as I can to the 15th level, right? [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10253.0s)]
*  Something happens. [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10257.48s)]
*  It didn't kick it very good, but I got a good kick into it. [[02:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10258.2s)]
*  Something happens. [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10261.72s)]
*  It's all kinds of commotion. [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10262.36s)]
*  They call it technical. [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10263.4s)]
*  Boom, done. [[02:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10264.36s)]
*  Commotion, boom. [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10265.24s)]
*  The ball is right back in my hand. [[02:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10266.76s)]
*  What do I do? [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10268.76s)]
*  Kick it again. [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10269.96s)]
*  I kind of kick the bitch further than that. [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10270.44s)]
*  So the next thing you know, now I'm kicked out of the game [[02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10274.04s)]
*  in the first quarter. [[02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10275.96s)]
*  This is a charity game? [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10277.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10278.68s)]
*  Over in China. [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10280.68s)]
*  Everyone came to see him play. [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10281.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10283.32s)]

*  Who's playing now? [[02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10286.199999999999s)]
*  It was like some, well, some other celebrities [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10287.32s)]
*  and some like G League guys. [[02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10290.199999999999s)]
*  Some other generals. [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10291.72s)]
*  I think Vince Carter was our coach. [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10294.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10297.08s)]

*  Didn't get no technical call on him. [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10300.279999999999s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10301.88s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10304.039999999999s)]
*  Because they're sucking his dick. [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10304.279999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10305.24s)]
*  But anyway, now I'm sitting over there. [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10307.32s)]
*  It's like it's got to be, I don't know if we played two quarters [[02:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10308.599999999999s)]
*  four quarters or two halves, but it's a lot of time left. [[02:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10311.72s)]
*  And I'm sitting over there and I see somebody in a crowd [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10314.36s)]
*  with a Marshall shirt on. [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10316.6s)]
*  Oh, that's old school. [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10318.28s)]

*  They're trying to win. [[02:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10356.92s)]
*  They're trying to beat us, right? [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10357.64s)]
*  They can't play, but I think they end up letting me play, [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10359.48s)]
*  come back in a second half. [[02:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10361.16s)]
*  But yeah, I was fearful that they were going to take my passport [[02:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10363.960000000001s)]
*  that trip. [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10367.64s)]

*  Well, yeah. [[02:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10372.2s)]
*  Why? [[02:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10372.68s)]
*  Think about that for the second time. [[02:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10372.92s)]
*  Well, I did a six-foot white boy in China prison [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10373.400000000001s)]
*  probably wouldn't go too well. [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10375.480000000001s)]

*  Why? [[02:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10486.28s)]
*  It is everything about it, just from the stray cows running down the freeway. [[02:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10486.76s)]
*  Or like traffic. [[02:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10491.640000000001s)]

*  And I swear to God, it took us two and a half hours. [[02:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10500.84s)]
*  But come to find out, it wasn't the car. [[02:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10503.24s)]
*  It was a guy up there. [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10505.24s)]
*  You know how a horse and carriage? [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10507.08s)]

*  Why were you all there? [[02:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10528.44s)]

*  I'm going to whoop your big ass if I don't. [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10559.48s)]
*  So they're like, oh, so right now, let's go. [[02:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10561.4s)]

*  So here we go. [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10566.12s)]
*  Larry Bird's face is this long. [[02:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10567.560000000001s)]
*  Oh, so he introduced me to Larry Bird. [[02:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10571.32s)]
*  He stood up. [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10575.24s)]
*  And I'm like, whoa. [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10575.720000000001s)]
*  I couldn't think of really anything to say. [[02:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10577.48s)]
*  And I said, so Larry, does Moonbois remind you of French Lick a lot? [[02:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10578.68s)]
*  French Lick, Indiana, where he grew up. [[02:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10585.16s)]
*  He said, yeah, it does. [[02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10587.4s)]
*  And when he said, yeah, it does, I kind of lost interest. [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10589.32s)]
*  Because I know you're lying through your teeth, Larry. [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10592.28s)]
*  There ain't nothing in this world that reminds you of Moonbois. [[02:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10594.44s)]
*  Nothing. [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10598.2s)]
*  It's one of a kind. [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10598.68s)]
*  Nothing like it. [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10600.68s)]
*  It's just different. [[02:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10601.960000000001s)]
*  And can't wait to come back. [[02:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10603.08s)]
*  Can't wait. [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10607.640000000001s)]
*  We did do a cool thing. [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10609.0s)]

*  Okay. [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10933.24s)]
*  Indonesia. [[03:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10934.119999999999s)]
*  We played in an arena. [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10935.0s)]
*  It was like closed in, kind of like SoFi. [[03:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10936.84s)]
*  You been to SoFi? [[03:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10938.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10939.4s)]
*  But it's not really closed in. [[03:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10940.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10941.32s)]
*  I mean, it was so hot. [[03:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10942.119999999999s)]
*  Like during timeouts, I'm trying to sit in the cooler, in the water cliff. [[03:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10946.279999999999s)]
*  So I couldn't do it. [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10949.88s)]
*  Dirt, damn near a dirt floor, wasn't it? [[03:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10951.24s)]
*  It was. [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10953.32s)]
*  Damn, I mean, whatever you want to call that. [[03:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10954.439999999999s)]
*  Indonesia's different too. [[03:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10956.6s)]
*  Were the refs cheating over there too? [[03:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10957.8s)]
*  No, they were happy to see us Americans. [[03:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10959.8s)]
*  Vin Baker, it was a long time ago. [[03:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10963.72s)]
*  Vin Baker was still playing. [[03:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10965.96s)]
*  Who was the old head that went with us? [[03:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10967.8s)]
*  Played for Milwaukee a long time ago, man. [[03:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10970.119999999999s)]
*  These were charity games or these are just like pre-season games? [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10972.359999999999s)]
*  Like a Chinese group, Cats with Money. [[03:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10974.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10979.880000000001s)]
*  Put on like an exhibition game. [[03:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10980.44s)]
*  Bring like some ex-retired NBA guys and we'll fill out the roster with [[03:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10983.0s)]
*  like our homies or G-Lig guys that are trying to get on [[03:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10986.52s)]
*  maybe in the Chinese leagues or something like that. [[03:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10989.56s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[03:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10991.48s)]
*  What's the biggest bag you ever got from one of those? [[03:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10991.880000000001s)]
*  Oh man, I get 100 grand, 150 grand maybe. [[03:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10993.640000000001s)]
*  Just for access. [[03:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10996.76s)]
*  It depends on how many games I played. [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10997.4s)]
*  Obviously, if you play games, you get paid more. [[03:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=10998.92s)]
*  Well, that's the way I work at it. [[03:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11001.32s)]
*  But I think my man, he hits them in the head when he goes over there. [[03:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11003.08s)]
*  Oh, I can imagine. [[03:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11006.04s)]
*  You have to. [[03:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11006.84s)]
*  For sure. [[03:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11007.24s)]
*  Just for him to show up, he's going to get some bread. [[03:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11008.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11010.28s)]
*  But like in China, man, it's crazy to me like how many fans there are in China basketball. [[03:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11010.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11016.28s)]
*  I think it's the difference in here in China is like 13-year-olds to like let's say 35-year-olds [[03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11016.68s)]
*  love the NBA here, right? [[03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11023.560000000001s)]
*  Well, they're 10-year-olds to fucking 90-year-olds. [[03:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11025.0s)]
*  They all love NBA. [[03:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11027.960000000001s)]
*  Fucking love it. [[03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11028.84s)]
*  Wow. [[03:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11029.800000000001s)]
*  Love it, bro. [[03:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11030.6s)]
*  That's really cool. [[03:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11031.16s)]
*  And what's their team? [[03:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11032.439999999999s)]
*  Houston, right? [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11033.24s)]
*  I'm sure it'd be Houston because Yao Ming and Trace McGrady is huge over there, too. [[03:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11034.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11038.279999999999s)]
*  He shuts shit down. [[03:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11038.84s)]
*  Wait, really? [[03:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11039.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11040.519999999999s)]
*  Like shuts shit down. [[03:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11041.48s)]
*  Did he spend a lot of time playing exhibition games there? [[03:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11042.199999999999s)]
*  Like why is he so good? [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11044.039999999999s)]
*  I just think because he was so good. [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11044.84s)]
*  Because he played with Yao. [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11045.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11046.759999999998s)]
*  He played with Yao. [[03:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11046.92s)]
*  And I think he went over there at the end of his career and played a year or two over [[03:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11047.64s)]
*  there in the Chinese basketball. [[03:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11050.279999999999s)]
*  What's that like? [[03:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11051.32s)]
*  Have you spoken to guys who like went and played there for the year? [[03:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11052.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11054.679999999998s)]
*  And what do they say? [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11055.0s)]
*  It's different. [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11055.8s)]
*  You can only have two Americans on your team. [[03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11057.8s)]
*  Most of those European teams, you can only have two Americans. [[03:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11059.64s)]
*  So that's why it's so important for an American guy to get a dual citizenship. [[03:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11061.72s)]
*  So he doesn't count as an American. [[03:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11066.039999999999s)]
*  Right. [[03:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11069.24s)]
*  That's interesting. [[03:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11069.72s)]
*  And they only got X amount of money to pay the... [[03:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11070.679999999998s)]
*  The other players. [[03:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11074.519999999999s)]
*  Correct. [[03:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11075.32s)]
*  And would that have been anything you would have considered late in career? [[03:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11077.4s)]
*  No. [[03:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11080.519999999999s)]
*  You don't want to be far from your family. [[03:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11080.76s)]
*  I don't want to do that. [[03:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11082.199999999999s)]
*  But like China for me is like a seven day tops. [[03:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11082.84s)]
*  That's as long as I can stay. [[03:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11086.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11087.8s)]
*  What happens after that? [[03:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11088.84s)]
*  Well... [[03:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11089.96s)]
*  In your body? [[03:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11090.519999999999s)]
*  I start to die. [[03:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11091.16s)]
*  I mean, that's what it is. [[03:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11100.76s)]
*  He's like, I can't eat shit. [[03:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11101.64s)]
*  So when he said, I don't like other people touching my food, [[03:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11104.6s)]
*  and then he said eating like India, I was like, I know. [[03:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11107.0s)]
*  I'm so glad though I got to go to India though. [[03:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11111.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11113.24s)]
*  I'm so thankful that I got to do all this type of shit that I've gotten to do. [[03:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11113.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11116.76s)]
*  And I hope there's more to come, I swear. [[03:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11117.4s)]
*  What about how is Dog? [[03:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11119.32s)]
*  I don't really know. [[03:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11123.32s)]
*  I mean, I was eating all kinds of shit and afterwards they told me, [[03:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11123.960000000001s)]
*  by the way, you ate such and such and such. [[03:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11126.2s)]
*  Really? [[03:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11128.2s)]
*  Like I said, I'm a good sport. [[03:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11128.6s)]
*  They put some shit out there, I'll try it. [[03:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11129.64s)]
*  I know he ain't going to try shit. [[03:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11130.92s)]
*  That's great. [[03:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11133.24s)]
*  They paid him to try it and he ain't going to try shit. [[03:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11133.880000000001s)]
*  And I'm adventurous. [[03:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11136.2s)]

*  Yeah. [[03:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11169.16s)]
*  Literally hot dog. [[03:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11170.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11171.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11171.72s)]
*  Dog is dripping blood. [[03:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11171.960000000001s)]
*  Whoa. [[03:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11173.960000000001s)]
*  Listen, man. [[03:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11175.32s)]
*  It's different. [[03:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11177.8s)]
*  It's a long way from Bell. [[03:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11178.6s)]
*  Basketball. [[03:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11180.04s)]
*  Global game, yeah. [[03:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11182.2s)]
*  Just a global game. [[03:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11183.48s)]
*  What's the edible story you mentioned? [[03:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11184.52s)]
*  Can I? [[03:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11188.68s)]
*  Talent. [[03:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11191.960000000001s)]
*  Just a good one. [[03:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11193.880000000001s)]
*  Allegedly. [[03:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11194.68s)]
*  Allegedly is how. [[03:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11195.32s)]
*  Allegedly because you know you can't have edibles in China. [[03:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11195.960000000001s)]
*  No, of course not. [[03:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11198.2s)]
*  We always fly with LAX. [[03:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11199.48s)]
*  Jay picked us some edibles on the way. [[03:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11201.64s)]
*  He was still kind of new in the edibles game. [[03:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11202.92s)]
*  We get out to China, like I don't know, first day or something. [[03:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11206.92s)]
*  We get into this event. [[03:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11209.960000000001s)]
*  I think Tracy McGrady was with us. [[03:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11211.72s)]
*  Couple NBA guys. [[03:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11213.08s)]
*  Chauncey Billups saved the day. [[03:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11214.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11215.64s)]
*  So saved the day. [[03:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11216.12s)]
*  They would have revoked my passport and everything if it wasn't for Chauncey. [[03:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11218.84s)]
*  Well, they were doing like little interviews or something. [[03:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11222.28s)]
*  We're in a big group. [[03:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11225.64s)]
*  It wasn't like one of our normal groups because in China, [[03:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11226.52s)]
*  like a small group would be like 100,000 people. [[03:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11228.44s)]
*  You know, it's like 100,000 people right there. [[03:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11230.92s)]
*  We're in a small little group and they're like doing little short interviews [[03:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11233.32s)]
*  and they bring Jay up. [[03:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11236.52s)]
*  But what happened was before we got out of the van, [[03:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11237.960000000001s)]
*  it was his first time doing the edibles. [[03:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11240.52s)]
*  He's like, hey, can you read up? [[03:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11242.92s)]
*  Because we got the internet. [[03:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11244.6s)]
*  He's like, read up how many milligrams I should take. [[03:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11245.800000000001s)]
*  So I'm like reading. [[03:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11248.36s)]
*  It was like little, little, little things. [[03:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11249.08s)]
*  I'm like, okay, so if it's your first time, [[03:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11251.16s)]
*  you should probably take like eight to 10 milligrams. [[03:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11252.84s)]
*  I looked over. [[03:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11255.800000000001s)]
*  He took the whole thing. [[03:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11256.76s)]
*  But the whole thing was four pieces of whole things. [[03:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11258.36s)]
*  I think he ended up with 200 milligrams or something. [[03:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11262.84s)]
*  Come on. [[03:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11265.0s)]
*  On his first rip. [[03:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11266.76s)]
*  Holy shit. [[03:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11267.640000000001s)]
*  On his first rip. [[03:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11268.44s)]
*  I'm in China. [[03:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11269.16s)]
*  I'm way over there, bro. [[03:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11274.92s)]
*  I'm way over there. [[03:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11276.28s)]
*  No matter where you're at, you were in China. [[03:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11278.6s)]
*  After you take four edibles, bro. [[03:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11280.2s)]
*  And that's his first rip. [[03:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11283.960000000001s)]
*  You just look like you're making fun of him. [[03:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11286.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11287.800000000001s)]
*  Right where I needed to be. [[03:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11293.32s)]
*  Okay, go. [[03:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11295.32s)]
*  We're inside and I can see he's starting to slow down a bit. [[03:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11295.88s)]
*  I'm keeping an eye on this, my dog. [[03:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11298.359999999999s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[03:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11299.8s)]
*  I'll make sure he don't want to make a bad name for himself. [[03:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11300.199999999999s)]
*  They asked him up to start doing an interview or something. [[03:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11303.16s)]
*  I can start to see like, oh, he's looking different. [[03:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11305.08s)]
*  And I'm keeping an eye on him like, oh shit. [[03:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11309.32s)]
*  He gets to one point, he's dribbling the ball [[03:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11311.88s)]
*  and he's talking to the guy. [[03:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11313.4s)]
*  He didn't know the ball stopped. [[03:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11315.24s)]
*  It wasn't with him. [[03:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11316.92s)]
*  No. [[03:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11317.64s)]
*  Hey. [[03:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11322.199999999999s)]
*  Hey. [[03:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11322.7s)]
*  Three more dribbles. [[03:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11324.94s)]
*  He still gave me the interview and he was on point with it. [[03:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11328.78s)]
*  Hey, you know what I'm saying? [[03:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11331.980000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, hey, bro. [[03:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11333.1s)]
*  Yo, where's this interview? [[03:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11337.26s)]
*  We need to find this interview, bro. [[03:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11338.94s)]
*  We need it. [[03:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11340.54s)]
*  I think Chauncey stepped in and started doing his thing. [[03:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11340.94s)]
*  And I took Jay like, hey, let's get on out of here. [[03:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11343.900000000001s)]
*  Take a quick little break, go get you some water. [[03:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11346.380000000001s)]
*  And I got him to the van and we sat inside this van. [[03:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11348.380000000001s)]
*  And it looked like all the water molecules in his body [[03:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11351.26s)]
*  had been sucked out. [[03:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11356.140000000001s)]
*  He looked like an old catcher's mitt. [[03:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11357.18s)]
*  And things were no joke. [[03:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11363.740000000002s)]
*  And I remember like yesterday, it was called TKO Punch. [[03:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11365.1s)]
*  Shout out to TKO Punch. [[03:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11367.660000000002s)]
*  Them things. [[03:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11369.740000000002s)]
*  I don't even think they make them no more, dude. [[03:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11370.220000000001s)]
*  We have since discovered which one it was [[03:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11372.300000000001s)]
*  and they only make them. [[03:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11374.300000000001s)]
*  See, it's them things. [[03:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11375.18s)]
*  And we found out the guy in the shop was like, [[03:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11375.740000000002s)]
*  oh, I remember those. [[03:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11377.740000000002s)]
*  He said one word, dangerous. [[03:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11380.06s)]
*  Dangerous. [[03:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11382.62s)]
*  Whoa. [[03:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11383.26s)]
*  And you had two of the bars? [[03:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11383.74s)]
*  Four acts of what you're supposed to have. [[03:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11386.300000000001s)]
*  It's only like a little square. [[03:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11387.66s)]
*  It's only like a little square, like a 50 cent piece. [[03:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11388.86s)]
*  Supposed to have like 8 to 10 milligrams. [[03:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11391.02s)]
*  He had 200. [[03:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11392.7s)]
*  He had like 20 times more than he was supposed to. [[03:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11393.98s)]
*  So what happened? [[03:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11396.06s)]
*  So we're in the van. [[03:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11396.94s)]
*  I tell you what, I slept great. [[03:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11398.300000000001s)]
*  For how many months? [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11401.18s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11401.98s)]
*  It's been a chaos. [[03:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11402.7s)]
*  We're in the van, but I was the only one in the van. [[03:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11404.06s)]
*  He was looking so far past me. [[03:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11407.019999999999s)]
*  Like the look in his eyes, I've never seen it before. [[03:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11408.859999999999s)]
*  I've never seen it since. [[03:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11411.42s)]
*  I'm like, bro, you good. [[03:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11412.38s)]
*  And I got a pretty good tolerance, but. [[03:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11415.019999999999s)]
*  I would imagine. [[03:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11416.38s)]
*  Those things. [[03:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11417.34s)]
*  Do you remember anything? [[03:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11418.46s)]
*  Like from that event, like from taking them to waking up? [[03:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11419.82s)]
*  No, I don't remember that. [[03:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11422.14s)]
*  I got to tell him that story. [[03:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11423.099999999999s)]
*  That's how it went down. [[03:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11424.539999999999s)]
*  So when do you recover? [[03:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11426.06s)]
*  When do you come back on? [[03:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11427.099999999999s)]
*  Oh, probably sometime that evening, I'm saying. [[03:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11428.699999999999s)]
*  Really? [[03:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11431.5s)]
*  That fast? [[03:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11432.3s)]

*  Come on, bro. [[03:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11612.3s)]
*  I chose it. [[03:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11613.1s)]
*  I cut it. [[03:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11614.94s)]
*  And then I recut it. [[03:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11616.460000000001s)]
*  You did the whole trick. [[03:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11618.54s)]
*  So you have to know the card. [[03:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11619.26s)]
*  He did them all. [[03:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11620.54s)]
*  He did all of them. [[03:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11621.1s)]
*  All of them. [[03:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11621.9s)]
*  But the other ones I think are... [[03:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11623.18s)]
*  There's math involved. [[03:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11624.220000000001s)]
*  This... [[03:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11625.74s)]

*  MGM. [[03:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11631.1s)]
*  I don't get that one. [[03:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11633.02s)]
*  I did all the cutting for that. [[03:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11634.78s)]
*  And I cut it however I want to cut it. [[03:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11636.7s)]
*  So even if I did like, you know, put it on the bottom so it goes wherever, [[03:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11638.460000000001s)]
*  how do you know my card before I... [[03:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11642.38s)]
*  He's in your head. [[03:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11645.82s)]
*  I think he had it in his hand the whole time. [[03:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11647.339999999998s)]
*  Somehow he just got it... [[03:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11648.939999999999s)]
*  At the end just got it on top somehow. [[03:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11650.859999999999s)]
*  I chose it. [[03:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTq3IDGgISg&t=11652.859999999999s)]
