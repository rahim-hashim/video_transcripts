**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [March 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU)
*  Do you believe that there were government agencies involved in the deaths of your father and uncle? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=0.0s)]
*  Clearly there was government agencies involved not only in the death of my uncle but the copra. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4.48s)]
*  How do you end up living with Larry Davis? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=9.28s)]
*  Hi Larry. He has a lot of rules that he expects everybody to know. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  You just announced that you were on Epstein's flight? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=15.52s)]
*  Len had called my wife and said we want to do an adventure this weekend. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=19.2s)]
*  I said do you want to take the kids' fossil hunt? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=23.12s)]
*  We flew out. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=25.76s)]
*  Great plane? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  No it was not. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=27.36s)]
*  I don't know. Was the election in Chicago fixed? Probably. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=28.32s)]
*  What does that mean fixed? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=32.24s)]
*  I mean they found ballots in the Chicago River. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=33.28s)]
*  They held it through the government of Ukraine in 2014 which is really what this war is about. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=35.44s)]
*  I mean I knew Harvey Weinstein. I knew Roger Ailes. OJ Simpson came to my house. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=40.24s)]
*  Bill Cosby came to my house. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=44.96s)]
*  You also knew good people. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  Yeah I knew that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=47.6s)]
*  You don't know these people. They're swan creatures until all this stuff comes out of them. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  OJ's innocent. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=53.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=55.36s)]
*  You just said you lived with Larry David. How do you end up living with Larry David? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=57.36s)]
*  He was... I recruited him and his wife Lori David. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=61.04s)]
*  I flew out to Los Angeles to recruit them to be on the board of the Natural Resource Defense Council. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=69.12s)]
*  I was a senior attorney. It's one of the two biggest environmental groups in the country. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=75.6s)]
*  And Lori had a big interest in the environment. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=82.24s)]
*  Larry... [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=88.08s)]
*  Who was Larry's interest? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=89.44s)]
*  She actually had... The first time I met them we had lunch at the Sunset Hotel in Los Angeles. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=93.2s)]
*  And Lori... The thing with NRDC is they didn't let you on the board unless you were the principal. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=102.48s)]
*  So the wife of a principal could not be on the board. It had to be Robert Redford. It had to be that person. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  And Lori was the one who was driving this and she wanted them both to have a board seat. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  And so she was talking about that she really called the shots. She was a very, very powerful [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  character. And she said, I control the money. I write the checks. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=136.96s)]
*  I have two interests. One is child health and the other is the environment. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=146.16s)]
*  And then I heard Larry who hadn't said anything and I heard him say something. He said, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=150.72s)]
*  he said, I only have one interest. And I said, what is that? And he said, it's Larry David. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=160.0s)]
*  Did they both get board seats? That was my first meeting with them. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=168.8s)]
*  Did they both get board seats? Yeah. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=171.84s)]
*  Okay. So you met them then. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=174.96s)]
*  And we became friends. And they had a house. They were building a house at that time in Martha's [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=176.96s)]
*  Vineyard. And I had lost my home. I had outgrown my home in Hyannisport, which is where we summered [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=183.6s)]
*  every summer. So they invited us to stay with them. So we stayed with them for two and a half summers. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=194.4s)]
*  And then we started taking our other vacations together. And we went skiing every winter. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=201.52s)]
*  And we became very, very close friends. And at that time, Larry was still doing Seinfeld. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=207.60000000000002s)]
*  And he had just retired. And then he decided to, he was going to go back to stand up comedy. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=214.16000000000003s)]
*  Okay. He decided to make a film about his return to stand up. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=222.08s)]
*  Which was kind of ended up being like the curb pilot. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=230.0s)]
*  And that was the pilot. They didn't intend to do a whole series. And they were recruiting, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=232.24s)]
*  Cheryl got recruited because they wanted it to be plausible. So that they didn't want to use no [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=239.92s)]
*  actors. Cheryl's your wife for everybody watching. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=245.84s)]
*  Cheryl's my wife. And she plays his wife. And the first pilot actually, she was supposed to be [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=247.52s)]
*  Jewish. Then they changed that later. And she became, she was a shiksa. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=254.4s)]
*  Are there any weird house rules that Larry had when you guys lived there? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=264.24s)]
*  He has a lot of rules that he expects everybody to know. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=270.32s)]
*  Well, I mean, one of the rules, I've talked about this before, but when I started this thing, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=276.08s)]
*  this couch really sucks you in. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=281.68s)]
*  But when I met Cheryl, he introduced me to Cheryl at a time when both of us were married. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=292.72s)]
*  And so, there was no chemistry. He brought her up. I was doing a big- [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=301.36s)]
*  There was no chemistry? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=306.24s)]
*  Well, not any kind of that kind of chemistry. I like you. It was all proper. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=307.44s)]
*  Tone the company line. I like this. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=317.12s)]
*  Yeah, but it was noteworthy enough. Both of us remembered what happened that day. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=318.8s)]
*  We were skiing up in Banff. And I did a, every year for Waterkeeper, which was my environmental [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=327.36s)]
*  group, co-founded and then built the biggest water protection group in the world. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=334.24s)]
*  Our big event every year was a pro-celebrity ski event. And that year we were doing it in Banff. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=340.40000000000003s)]
*  And it was very cold. And so, Larry would come every year. I'd say to him, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=348.72s)]
*  can you bring some other people? So he brought Cheryl and some other people. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=355.12s)]
*  And so, we met on that ski trip. But as I said, there was no chemical reaction. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=359.84s)]
*  Six years later, we were both involved in a divorce. And she came to another event [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=368.96s)]
*  at that time. And there was kind of an instant chemical reaction. But I knew that [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=375.28s)]
*  Larry, because he does have these rules and one of those rules- [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=382.56s)]
*  What are the rules? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=386.8s)]
*  I need to know that. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=387.36s)]
*  I could not date his television wife without getting his permission first. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=389.2s)]
*  Why? What is his logic? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=396.8s)]
*  You know, I mean, he watched the show, right? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=398.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=400.32s)]
*  But the show always has logic in the thing. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=400.48s)]
*  What I like about it- [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=402.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. And they all have logic. They're not arbitrary rules. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=403.84s)]
*  They're rules that kind of everybody does know, but they're not written down anywhere. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=408.15999999999997s)]
*  Exactly, yeah. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=412.48s)]
*  Some people are quirky and weird and their shows are built around how different and weird they are. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=413.84000000000003s)]
*  And they go, yeah, I'm just an anxious weird guy. I feel like Larry's like, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=418.48s)]
*  you guys are weird for not adhering to these rules that we all know make sense. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=422.24s)]
*  He feels right and justified in everything he does. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=427.6s)]
*  He's corky. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=430.32s)]
*  I mean, that's a good way of characterizing it. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=430.72s)]
*  So what is his justification for why you can't be with his TV wife? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=434.40000000000003s)]
*  It's just obvious that- [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=439.12s)]
*  That- [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=440.71999999999997s)]
*  Oh, it could affect the rel- You might not want him kissing her on the show. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=441.36s)]
*  No, no, no. He had initial claimed her and since we're friends- [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=445.36s)]
*  You think sexually? You think Larry was into it or what? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=453.84s)]
*  I think he loves Cheryl. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=458.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=461.52s)]
*  And I'll tell you what he said to me because I came- [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=463.52s)]
*  You called dibs, right? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=466.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=469.04s)]
*  It's first right or refusal, right? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=470.08s)]
*  Yeah. What did he say? He's like, man, Kennedy's always meddling. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=471.28s)]
*  So that season was a season which Cheryl wasn't in it. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=477.28s)]
*  He later, it was after he was divorced from Cheryl, which was the way it happened was, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=484.16s)]
*  that show would follow his life and it would predict his life. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=490.64s)]
*  So he wrote himself getting a divorce on that show and then that year, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=494.32s)]
*  Laurie told him she wanted a divorce. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=499.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=501.36s)]
*  I mean, how did that happen? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=502.0s)]
*  It was his outlet. This is my dream world. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=503.52s)]
*  He was shooting the year after the divorce, he moves to New York to shoot a play, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=508.96s)]
*  which is called The Producers. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=515.84s)]
*  I remember. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=517.36s)]
*  That is right. But he has to move to New York to do that. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=517.84s)]
*  So I flew to New York and I went to visit him. He was staying at the Lowe's Hotel [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=521.92s)]
*  and I visited him at 10 o'clock at night and I said, I need to talk to you about something. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=530.9599999999999s)]
*  And then I said, I don't know how I put it, but I said, I feel a lot of affection [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=539.36s)]
*  and attraction to Cheryl and I just wanted to check with you to make sure that was cool. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=548.4000000000001s)]
*  And he said, he surprised me because I felt like he would be horrified. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=553.2s)]
*  He said, she's the best human being that he's ever met. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=562.0s)]
*  He said that she is beloved in the industry and that she is the only person in Hollywood [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=566.4000000000001s)]
*  that doesn't have a single enemy and that he was really happy for me. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=572.32s)]
*  Now, when he talked to Cheryl and she said, do you think this is going to work? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=575.76s)]
*  To be fair, you didn't ask him what he thought about y'all's chances. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=588.16s)]
*  He was consistent. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=591.12s)]
*  You asked him what he thought about Cheryl and he's like, she's the best. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=591.76s)]
*  It was true. He's always honest in that way. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=596.8s)]
*  But then he reenacted it, that moment on Curb with Ted Danson asking for permission and he says, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=601.44s)]
*  no, you can't do that. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=611.52s)]
*  When you guys were living together at the Vineyard, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=617.36s)]
*  did he have rules about food or anything? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=620.96s)]
*  Did you ever drink too much OJ and he had to sit there? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=623.04s)]
*  He's a shoes off guy, I assume. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=625.28s)]
*  One of the preoccupations he had, and he actually gave a speech about this and another comedy event [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=630.48s)]
*  that I had, the difference between the Kennedys and the Davids. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=639.04s)]
*  And he had a long speech of all the different things that the Kennedys, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=644.64s)]
*  when they were kids, could not come in the house until it was dark. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=649.04s)]
*  So we were locked out of the house in the morning and they said, don't come back till dark. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=655.52s)]
*  And he said, the Davids were locked in the house all day and were never allowed to go [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=659.6s)]
*  out because the world was dangerous. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=664.32s)]
*  He had a litany of those kind of things. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=668.64s)]
*  And my family, my brothers would come over and visit a lot. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=671.6800000000001s)]
*  He's the same person he is on the show except a much more generous, kind-hearted version of that. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=682.32s)]
*  Anyway, it was really, really fun living over there. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=689.6800000000001s)]
*  So many things I want to talk to you about today. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=694.4s)]
*  All these crazy notes, maybe I get there. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=696.72s)]
*  First of all, there are people that are listening or watching that might not know you. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=699.36s)]
*  Can you explain your voice to them? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=702.96s)]
*  I had a very strong voice, in fact, unusually strong voice, till I was 42 years old, 1996. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=707.12s)]
*  I got an injury, a brain injury that caused this to my voice. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=716.3199999999999s)]
*  And it's called spasmodic dystonia. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=723.68s)]
*  And it's pretty much stable. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=726.96s)]
*  And in fact, it was much worse. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=730.0s)]
*  Got better. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=731.84s)]
*  So Cheryl and I went over about, I don't know, eight months, maybe three months before I [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=734.24s)]
*  announced my candidacy. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=740.72s)]
*  And we went to Japan and they do this surgery in Japan where they put a piece of, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=743.44s)]
*  like a bridge of titanium in my throat. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=749.2s)]
*  And it helped. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=753.76s)]
*  And then I started doing some therapies. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=754.4s)]
*  And it's improving. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=757.68s)]
*  If you woke up from that surgery with an Asian accent, that would have helped. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=759.76s)]
*  I said that. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=763.2s)]
*  I said, I don't want that happening. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=764.8s)]
*  I told that to a guy. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=766.48s)]
*  Before you went under, you said? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=768.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, they never put me under. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=770.4s)]
*  I need to pronounce R's. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=771.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm R-F-K. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=772.4799999999999s)]
*  They never put me under. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=773.68s)]
*  Did you get in trouble for Asian stuff? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=778.16s)]
*  No. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=780.9599999999999s)]
*  I must have misread that. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=782.8s)]
*  It wasn't a misread. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=787.1999999999999s)]
*  It was. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=788.16s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=789.8399999999999s)]
*  He got you. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=791.12s)]
*  He got you. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=793.12s)]
*  He got you. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=793.76s)]
*  So I'm not going to go there with you. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=796.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=797.76s)]
*  Good. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=798.48s)]
*  Good. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=798.96s)]
*  You're our president. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=799.4399999999999s)]
*  You can't be making these jokes. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=800.4s)]
*  I'll be making these jokes. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=801.4399999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=802.8s)]
*  It's not the worst day in America. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=803.68s)]
*  It's not the worst day in Japan. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=804.8s)]
*  When I did that surgery, they never knocked me out. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=805.92s)]
*  So they did the whole thing when I was awake because they had to test out a bunch of different [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=811.12s)]
*  voices on me. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=815.52s)]
*  No way. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=816.72s)]
*  And Cheryl was in the room, but there was a lot of carnage that was associated with it. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=818.0s)]
*  And she ended up having to leave. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=823.36s)]
*  But she was listening to the voices and they would say, okay, count in this voice. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=826.4s)]
*  And they'd move the bridge. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=831.12s)]
*  And I'd say, you know, one, two, three, four, five. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=832.64s)]
*  And they'd say, do you like that one? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=835.76s)]
*  And that's what happened. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=839.2s)]
*  Is it laborious at all to talk? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=840.32s)]
*  It's, I have to think about it, which I didn't before. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=843.44s)]
*  But not painful. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=849.6s)]
*  It's not painful, but it's painful for me to listen to myself. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=851.04s)]
*  I can't listen to myself. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=855.52s)]
*  If I hear myself on TV, I'll never watch this podcast. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=858.0799999999999s)]
*  Because I just can't stand the sound of my voice. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=864.3199999999999s)]
*  And I feel sorry for other people who have to listen to it, but it's all I got. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=866.88s)]
*  Well, if you're president, we're going to have to listen a lot. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=870.9599999999999s)]
*  A lot of people, you know, are worried about that. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=874.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=876.7199999999999s)]
*  You could just tweet. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=877.52s)]
*  They had to say on the internet, I like everything about you, but I can't take your voice. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=878.32s)]
*  Can't we do auto-tune? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=881.84s)]
*  Isn't there like a... [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=883.2800000000001s)]
*  There should be AI. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=884.4000000000001s)]
*  Because we do it with singers, right? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=886.24s)]
*  Like they have these weird inflections and then we manipulate it. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=887.9200000000001s)]
*  And then people are starting to write me saying, I can fix you with AI or I can fix the way you appear or something like that. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=890.72s)]
*  But every day I get somebody who says, I can fix your voice. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=899.2800000000001s)]
*  And I used to try them all. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=904.32s)]
*  Because I'm willing to try sort of new therapies and treatments, but I don't have patience for them. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=906.8s)]
*  So it's hard for me to stick with them over long periods of time, especially if I don't see quick returns. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=913.76s)]
*  And now I say to people, and a lot of them went to dead ends. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=922.0s)]
*  Now I say to people, show me somebody with my condition who you fixed before. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=926.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's good. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=930.48s)]
*  And so very few of them can do that. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=931.4399999999999s)]
*  Actual question, having to think about what you're going to say, does that kind of end up being a good thing in your position? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=934.88s)]
*  No, because it doesn't give me extra time. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=939.2800000000001s)]
*  I'm having to think about, I better take a breath first before I start talking or maybe nothing will come out. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=942.0s)]
*  But it used to be with my voice that there were times, particularly early in the morning, if I spoke, I didn't know if anything was going to come out. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=949.2800000000001s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=957.76s)]
*  So now it's much better. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=958.5600000000001s)]
*  It's much more reliable. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=961.12s)]
*  Yo, quick announcements. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=962.56s)]
*  Los Angeles. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=963.92s)]
*  I know a lot of you out there have been asking me to add another show. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=964.9599999999999s)]
*  First of all, thank you guys so much for selling out the forum. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=968.3199999999999s)]

*  You were you've done one of the craziest things ever, which is you just announced that you were on Epstein's flight. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1032.6399999999999s)]
*  Like you're the only person, I think, that was like, hey, I was on. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1039.2s)]
*  Usually people were like, hey, you were on. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1042.8s)]
*  And you were like, no, let me let me just tell everybody. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1044.72s)]
*  Great plane. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1047.68s)]
*  Was it playing? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1049.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1050.72s)]
*  No, it was not. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1051.52s)]
*  It wasn't like a big plane. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1059.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1061.52s)]
*  I've been on Donald Trump's plane. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1063.44s)]
*  Nice. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1065.2s)]
*  It's like a 737. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1066.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1067.84s)]
*  It's not like a little G6 or something like that. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1068.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1071.76s)]
*  Wow. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1072.26s)]
*  I love it. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1072.76s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1073.26s)]
*  That's flex on him. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1073.76s)]
*  A little G6. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1076.72s)]
*  Okay, but give the context obviously to the Epstein thing. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1077.44s)]
*  Because you basically. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1079.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1080.96s)]
*  So first of all, I'm in New York for most of my life. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1083.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1089.8400000000001s)]
*  So and I run into everybody in New York. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1090.3400000000001s)]
*  I mean, I knew Harvey Weinstein. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1093.28s)]
*  I knew Roger Ailes. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1095.6000000000001s)]
*  I knew OJ Simpson came to my house. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1096.88s)]
*  Bill Cosby came to my house. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1099.8400000000001s)]
*  You also knew good people. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1101.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1103.04s)]
*  I did know a lot of them. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1104.88s)]
*  But you don't know these people are swamp creatures until all this stuff comes out. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1106.64s)]
*  OJ is innocent. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1112.96s)]
*  OJ has done nothing. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1114.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1116.96s)]
*  Wait, do you know something? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1124.0s)]
*  Okay, go on. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1127.8400000000001s)]
*  So you're hanging out. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1128.48s)]
*  So anyway, yeah. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1129.6000000000001s)]
*  So in 1993, my wife, who has since passed away, Mary Richardson, she knew Glenn Maxwell. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1130.96s)]
*  And I forget exactly how, but she knew she lived in England and she knew Glenn Maxwell. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1142.0800000000002s)]
*  And she said to me, we were going to Palm Beach to visit my mother over Easter. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1148.24s)]
*  And she said that Glenn had offered her a flight. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1156.72s)]
*  So we went on the flight and we flew down there with them. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1161.8400000000001s)]
*  And then we stayed with my mom and all my kids were on the flight. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1168.3200000000002s)]
*  This is 93. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1172.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, don't look like that. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1173.68s)]
*  Air flying. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1174.64s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1175.3600000000001s)]
*  Retrospective. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1176.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1177.52s)]
*  I had very, very young kids. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1179.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1180.8000000000002s)]
*  But anyway. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1181.92s)]
*  Made it worse. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1184.4s)]
*  They, the stuff didn't come out about him until I think 2006. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1186.48s)]
*  2006, yeah. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1194.5600000000002s)]
*  That's 13 years later. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1195.68s)]
*  Nobody knew at that point. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1196.88s)]
*  And then sometime in the next year or two, I can't remember when, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1199.44s)]
*  I did another flight with them because they had, they, Glenn had called my wife again and said, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1206.0s)]
*  we want to do like an adventure this weekend. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1211.92s)]
*  And I said, do you want to go? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1217.1200000000001s)]
*  Foss? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1218.64s)]
*  I knew a paleontologist who worked on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1219.1200000000001s)]
*  And I had wanted to go out there and do Foss hunting. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1225.04s)]
*  I said, do you want to take the kids Foss hunting? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1227.68s)]
*  What an awesome weekend activity. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1230.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1232.88s)]
*  So we flew out. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1233.3600000000001s)]
*  We went to, we went to to Sitting Bull, which is the big mountain. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1234.64s)]
*  We went to Rushmore and then we spent a day Foss hunting, which was really great. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1242.48s)]
*  My son found a skull, almost a perfect skull of a saber toothed tiger. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1248.88s)]
*  But Epstein at that time. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1253.92s)]
*  Sometimes you say things that my brain can't even comprehend. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1255.28s)]
*  As if they're so normal. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1258.0800000000002s)]
*  You said I summered in Banff. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1259.2s)]
*  You lost me at summered in or whatever. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1260.88s)]
*  The Foss hunt, was Epstein on the Foss hunt? [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1263.28s)]
*  Was that the first time he's looked for old Foss? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1265.52s)]
*  That's the first time I spent time with him. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1267.6000000000001s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1270.0800000000002s)]
*  And I, and I realized he was creepy. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1270.96s)]
*  Was he? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1276.0s)]
*  Okay, go. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1276.4s)]
*  He got, I'll tell you two things that happened on that flight. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1277.76s)]
*  First of all, when we got to, when we got to Rapid City, there were two cars, rental cars, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1282.56s)]
*  waiting right SUVs waiting for us to take us out to the Foss hunting. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1291.2s)]
*  And he took one of them for himself. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1296.24s)]
*  And then all of us were in the rest of them. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1298.64s)]
*  And he didn't actually Foss hunt. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1301.6000000000001s)]
*  He stayed in that car and then he would get out and be on his cell phone. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1304.56s)]
*  When we were at Rushmore or something like that. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1310.32s)]
*  And when we were Foss hunting, then all the kids filled up boxes with Foss holes. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1313.1200000000001s)]
*  And we had a great time, but he was not a participant. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1318.8s)]
*  And then on the way back, I was asking him about how he made his money. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1321.6000000000001s)]
*  Because I knew that he had been a teacher at Dalton School. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1326.64s)]
*  And he told me that, and I asked him, and I knew then he was the money manager for Wes Wexler. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1329.52s)]
*  Wexler, yeah. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1339.76s)]
*  Yeah, on the limited. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1341.76s)]
*  So I said to him, how did you go from being a math teacher at Dalton School to that? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1343.76s)]
*  So, okay, good. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1349.76s)]
*  He said that some Chinese people had approached him. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1351.12s)]
*  Who had been taken advantage of by American grifters. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1358.08s)]
*  And they had lost a lot of money and they asked him to find the money for them. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1362.48s)]
*  And he succeeded in doing it. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1366.6399999999999s)]
*  And that was how he had, that was the launch pad for his career. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1368.32s)]
*  So that didn't make any sense. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1374.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1376.56s)]
*  Because it just raised 50 more questions. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1377.36s)]
*  Like, how did the Chinese guys find you at Dalton School? [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1379.6s)]
*  So anyway, when somebody is talking to you and you have a meter that is like this, doesn't make any sense. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1384.9599999999998s)]
*  And he told me something else on that flight, which was, I said to him, I asked him about something about investing in the stock market. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1392.7199999999998s)]
*  And he said, I don't invest in anything on the stock market unless I have inside knowledge. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1403.92s)]
*  So, and I had just met him and he was telling me that he was committing federal crimes. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1410.96s)]
*  He's only insider trading. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1417.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1418.8s)]
*  And then the plane landed in Chicago. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1421.6000000000001s)]
*  We thought we were going down in New York and it landed in Chicago and he got off the plane. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1425.68s)]
*  And there was limousine waiting for, or Mercedes waiting for them there and it had a very beautiful blonde, like very beautiful woman standing next to it. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1431.0400000000002s)]
*  And he said, my plane, my plans have changed. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1442.48s)]
*  I need to go to Europe. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1445.2800000000002s)]
*  And he got off our plane and they took the Mercedes to another plane on the time hack and he and the girl got on it. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1447.76s)]
*  And Glenn was sitting in our plane crying. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1455.6000000000001s)]
*  And never explained it, but I just thought that he's a creep. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1458.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1465.28s)]
*  What do you think her involvement in that whole? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1465.68s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1468.0s)]
*  I don't have any information. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1468.88s)]
*  My kids. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1470.24s)]
*  Did you get a vibe from her like you got from him? [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1471.3600000000001s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1474.24s)]
*  So you see, sometimes I don't know. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1477.2s)]
*  I mean, I also, I mean, I was thinking about it. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1479.8400000000001s)]
*  Of course. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1482.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1483.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1483.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1484.3s)]
*  And I knew, you know, I felt like she was raised in wealth and privilege, incredible top of the aristocracy and everybody knew her. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1484.8s)]
*  Her father's Robert Maxwell. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1501.3s)]
*  Robert Maxwell and then Robert Maxwell and her brother, who was the heir apparent, Robert Maxwell then dies in this very weird way. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1502.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1513.94s)]
*  And in the Mediterranean, it could be suicide. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1515.1399999999999s)]
*  It could be, you know, something else. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1518.26s)]
*  So, and then the brother then, and they find that then his whole empire collapses and it turns out that he's been stealing from the labor unions and the entire fortune disappears. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1521.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1534.1s)]
*  And Glenn then comes to the United States, you know, it's hard for them to live here and she comes and. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1535.22s)]
*  Latches on to this. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1540.6599999999999s)]
*  I think she, my impression was that, and I don't know, she was always wonderful to me and, you know, kind. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1541.3s)]
*  But again, you never know about people, but it seemed to me that she was looking for somebody, you know, who to replace the father who had wealth, et cetera. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1548.6599999999999s)]
*  And, and then, you know, Jeffrey was the kind of guy who would test. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1561.46s)]
*  Your loyalty? [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1566.26s)]
*  Your loyalty by, you know, continuing to push you to the edge from what I know about him now. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1567.3s)]
*  So I don't know much about what happened to him then, you know, other than what I read. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1573.3s)]
*  It's not a big interest to me, but my kids were very, very smart and well informed and not a conspiracy theorist like me. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1579.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1588.8999999999999s)]
*  One of my older kids said to me, he was definitely killed. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1589.78s)]
*  Oh, and I was, it was Connor. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1593.86s)]
*  And I said, and I was shocked to hear him say that because usually. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1596.02s)]
*  When I say to him things to him, like, you know, when I say something to him about he's skeptical of me. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1600.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1610.02s)]
*  So, and that's their job as kids. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1610.34s)]
*  You want to raise kids who don't just believe everything you say. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1612.18s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1616.02s)]
*  I succeeded in doing that. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1616.42s)]
*  Easier for you than. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1618.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1620.4199999999998s)]
*  So anyway, he's very, you know, he's very grounded, very well informed. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1622.1s)]
*  And he said to me. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1627.6999999999998s)]
*  Jeffries. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1629.4599999999998s)]
*  It was definitely a murder. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1630.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1632.02s)]
*  Because of the weird circumstance. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1632.82s)]
*  There's too many weird coincidences. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1634.6599999999999s)]
*  Follow up question about this. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1636.82s)]
*  There's all these people that are kind of with Epstein a lot. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1638.34s)]
*  You picked up on a creepy vibe from him immediately. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1642.26s)]
*  Do you have any judgment toward a guy like a Bill Gates who's associated with him a lot and either like the, are you like, nah, you must have seen some creepy shit and look the other way? [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1645.54s)]
*  Because I picked it up very quickly. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1654.8999999999999s)]
*  Like, what are your thoughts on that? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1656.18s)]
*  Especially I don't, you know, I don't, I try to stay away from that kind of speculation. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1657.1399999999999s)]
*  Like, if you look at my book, Anthony Fauci, I tell people what I know happened and what can be documented. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1663.7s)]
*  But I never connected to odds and say, oh, he must have known or he was motivated by this or that. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1671.06s)]
*  I try never to look in people's heads. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1677.22s)]
*  But I did see creepiness immediately. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1680.26s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1683.38s)]
*  The other thing is, and I think Jeffrey immediately realized that I was not a target, that I was not, you know, yeah, I was not. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1684.98s)]
*  You couldn't be an asset. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1696.9s)]
*  He couldn't manipulate. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1698.02s)]
*  I'm not going to. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1699.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1699.78s)]
*  And I didn't have interest that I was like, you know, interested in building Riverkeeper and, you know, so I don't know. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1700.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1708.02s)]
*  And yeah, that's it. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1708.5s)]
*  That's also interesting that you kind of, I don't want to say checked him, but you were vetting him, like just asking him where the money came from. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1709.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1716.26s)]
*  I think immediately is like, oh, this guy might be able to smell something. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1716.5s)]
*  There's already skepticism. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1719.54s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1720.82s)]
*  And he's not going to wow you with money. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1721.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1723.22s)]
*  He's not going to wow you with experience. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1723.86s)]
*  Big ass G6 guy. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1725.22s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1726.42s)]
*  The answer to the question that everybody wants to know, Akash, what is your decision? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1730.02s)]
*  In this March 10th, man, this is very tough. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1735.3s)]
*  In this March 10th, I'm going to take my talents to YouTube and release my new special, Gaslit. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1739.3s)]
*  YouTube. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1745.54s)]
*  That was the conclusion that you woke up with this morning. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1746.58s)]
*  That was the conclusion I woke up with this morning. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1749.06s)]
*  Why? [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1751.3s)]
*  You know, I just feel it's going to give me the best opportunity to grow, to expand my... [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1751.94s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1757.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean, why is this newsworthy at all? [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1757.94s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1760.58s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1761.06s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1761.4599999999998s)]
*  You've been on YouTube for years. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1762.1799999999998s)]
*  Well, yeah, but this is my special. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1764.02s)]
*  So it's special. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1766.8999999999999s)]
*  You already did a special on YouTube. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1767.6999999999998s)]
*  It was Bring Back Apu. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1769.3s)]
*  I helped you promote that. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1770.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, but this is an hour. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1772.34s)]
*  And it's an hour. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1774.1s)]
*  That's more time. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1775.06s)]
*  This has been done a million times. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1775.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean, your friend, Andrew Schultz, has a whole business model around this. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1777.1399999999999s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1779.78s)]
*  You know, I have the news to do, right? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1780.5s)]
*  I have wars to cover. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1782.58s)]
*  I mean, what makes you think that I have time for this? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1784.34s)]
*  Does it help you to know that the money is going to the children? [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1786.8999999999999s)]
*  Does it actually go into the children? [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1791.86s)]
*  I mean, it will if I have a child. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1794.8999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1796.74s)]

*  Based on what you've seen in your life, how can you not conspire? [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1875.46s)]
*  By the way, show me a conspiracy theory that I've had that is not either generally accepted [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1880.82s)]

*  Yeah, I'm not giving pushback. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1889.54s)]
*  It was, I was told that I was a conspiracy theorist because I thought glyphosate, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1890.66s)]
*  which is round up, caused cancer. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1897.94s)]
*  Well, then, you know, I want a $2.2 billion jury verdict on that. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1900.66s)]
*  Three jury verdicts. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1904.82s)]
*  Can you explain what it is, round up? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1905.46s)]
*  Round up is. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1907.22s)]
*  For us city boys. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1908.02s)]
*  Round up is an herb. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1909.6200000000001s)]
*  It's the most commonly used herbicide on earth. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1910.66s)]
*  And it has, it's the active ingredient is glyphosate. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1914.18s)]
*  It's made by Monsanto. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1919.78s)]
*  It kills everything green except things, except plants that have been genetically altered [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1922.3400000000001s)]
*  to be round up resistant. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1929.46s)]
*  And so, you know, you have round up ready corn where the seeds have been altered so that [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1931.22s)]
*  and you can fire all the farm workers who used to wear backpack sprayers and spray the weeds. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1937.06s)]
*  When you're competing and you know, and you saturate the entire landscape from an airplane [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1944.1000000000001s)]
*  with glyphosate and everything green will die except the corn. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1949.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1952.98s)]
*  So now they have round up ready corn. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1953.6200000000001s)]
*  They have round up ready soy. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1955.3s)]
*  It and glyphosate is everywhere now. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1957.6200000000001s)]
*  It's in your kids Cheerios. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1960.42s)]
*  It's in the, it's in the wine. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1962.74s)]
*  It's in beer. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1965.3000000000002s)]
*  It's in everything. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1967.22s)]
*  But what we did, we sued on behalf of home gardeners. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1968.8200000000002s)]
*  And we had about, and in the end we had about 40,000 home gardeners who had gotten [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1974.1000000000001s)]
*  non-Hodgkin's lymphoma from round up. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1978.1000000000001s)]
*  And the reason we sued on home gardeners is because home gardeners are very careful [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1982.34s)]
*  about chemical exposures. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1988.74s)]
*  And if we could not sue on behalf of farm workers because farm workers are exposed to [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1991.3799999999999s)]
*  everything, atrazine, neonicotinoids, all of this wide range of, and so you can't really, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=1996.8999999999999s)]
*  there's so many variables. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2002.1s)]
*  That's about which thing is actually causing the cancer. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2002.74s)]
*  But with home gardeners, you could. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2004.98s)]
*  Yeah, we can isolate it and we could say, you know, we get them on the sand and say, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2007.06s)]
*  did you ever use another pesticide? [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2012.4199999999998s)]
*  Never. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2014.26s)]
*  Why did you use it? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2015.22s)]
*  Because they had a picture on the front of it that had a guy spraying with bare feet [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2016.1799999999998s)]
*  and his shirt off. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2020.98s)]
*  And it said safer than aspirin, safer than anything. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2023.22s)]
*  You can drink it. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2026.4199999999998s)]
*  And so we represented home gardeners and we won a series. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2029.1399999999999s)]
*  Louise won $289 million in the first suit. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2037.3799999999999s)]
*  An African American groundskeeper for a school in Northern California who had gotten it all [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2040.8200000000002s)]
*  over his body. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2046.9s)]
*  He was getting it. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2047.78s)]
*  He was carrying a sprayer that leaked and he was getting these postulating lesions. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2049.46s)]
*  He called up Monsanto and he said, could this be from the Roundup? [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2056.5s)]
*  And they either didn't answer the phone and they told him no. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2061.62s)]
*  And he kept using it. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2066.26s)]
*  And he kept using it and then they covered his whole body and he was dying. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2067.78s)]
*  When we tried to get it. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2072.7400000000002s)]
*  The massive accomplishment, I think to reinforce what Andrew is saying, is an idea of like, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2074.02s)]
*  I think people will just kind of write you off as conspiracy theorists. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2077.2200000000003s)]
*  I think his point is to empathize with like what you've seen in your life. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2080.1000000000004s)]
*  We say assassinated because it's not personal for us. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2084.82s)]
*  Your dad is murdered. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2087.2200000000003s)]
*  Nobody really understands what happened. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2088.82s)]
*  Your uncle is murdered as the president. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2090.42s)]
*  Nobody's really clear on what happened. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2092.42s)]
*  So obviously a guy who grows up like that is going to see these theories and be like, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2094.02s)]
*  I'm not dismissing any of this because of what happened to me in my life. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2097.7s)]
*  I think that's what you're trying to say. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2100.7400000000002s)]
*  100%. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2101.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2102.26s)]
*  I think that's where it's like people can write you off as conspiracy theorists, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2102.58s)]
*  but also empathize, agree or disagree with, of course, you probably would be too. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2105.38s)]
*  Why wouldn't you be skeptical? [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2109.86s)]
*  Especially if it's, I mean, I don't know. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2111.06s)]
*  Do you believe that there were government agencies involved in the deaths of your father and uncle? [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2113.62s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, clearly there was government agencies involved, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2118.42s)]
*  not only in the death of my uncle, but the cover up. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2121.7s)]
*  And, you know, I'm an attorney. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2124.9s)]
*  Just with the evidence without any doing any discovery with the evidence out there now [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2129.06s)]
*  that is accumulated about my uncle says there's over a million documents. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2133.86s)]
*  Many of the people involved that made confessions, including E Howard Hunt, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2137.54s)]
*  David Adley Phillips, David Morales, Charles Harrelson, Woody's father, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2144.18s)]
*  who was involved peripherally in it and many, many others who were involved have confessed. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2150.42s)]
*  But also there's just, there's hundreds of thousands of documents that show what happened. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2160.26s)]
*  And you have a 60 year CIA effort to make sure nobody sees that. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2166.82s)]
*  Okay. So can you tell us what one you think happened based on those documents and based [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2172.82s)]
*  on what those people said and then also what the CIA has done to squash those? [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2177.3s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the best evidence is that the CIA was involved in a project to assassinate Castro. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2183.7000000000003s)]
*  And in order to promote that project, they recruited, there was a CIA station chief [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2193.54s)]
*  in Miami and the head of the project was a guy called Bill Harvey, who hated my father. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2204.34s)]
*  My father and him just tangled with each other from the beginning. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2210.42s)]
*  And my father was attorney general, but he was also overseeing the CIA. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2215.38s)]
*  And Harvey hated my father. My father extremely disliked him. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2220.42s)]
*  And Harvey was running the Cuba project, including the assassination project. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2225.6200000000003s)]
*  And he recruited three big mob families to help him assassinate Castro. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2230.74s)]
*  Santos Tropicante from Tampa, Florida, and Sam Giancana from Chicago, and Carlos Marcello, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2237.06s)]
*  who was the Dallas and New Orleans crime chief. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2247.7799999999997s)]
*  These are Italian mafia families or Cuba? [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2254.66s)]
*  Actually, Carlos Marcello is of Italian descent, but he was Tunisian. He was born in, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2257.46s)]
*  he was a very interesting character. My father once, one day they deported him because he was [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2265.1400000000003s)]
*  here illegally and he ran, he was a tiny little guy and he ran the whole mob family, the mob from [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2270.6600000000003s)]
*  Dallas to New Orleans. My father, one point- Which mob though? The Italian mob? [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2277.1400000000003s)]
*  Those are the three most powerful mafia families. The reason they were involved is they all had [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2283.86s)]
*  casinos in Havana. Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it. And when Castro, that was this big thing. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2290.1000000000004s)]
*  In fact, when I've talked to Castro, I've met with him a number of times. Really? Yeah. And I asked [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2297.78s)]
*  him, are you getting capitalism back? And he said, yeah, we're going to get it carefully, bring it [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2304.6600000000003s)]
*  back, but never the casinos. And the casino, because he thought that it corrupted the whole [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2310.82s)]
*  country. So this is interesting. So there's the interest from the Italian mafia families [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2316.42s)]
*  because they're profiting off of these casinos. Americans are flying down there, they're spending [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2320.82s)]
*  tons of money in these casinos. They're extricated. They were making millions, millions on those [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2324.9s)]
*  casinos. So they're incentivized to get him the fuck out of here so it's easy for the US government. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2328.7400000000002s)]
*  So they can go back and bring the casinos back. I get it, I get it, I get it. They want to turn [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2333.86s)]
*  Vegas. Okay. So they, and Bill Harvey, the CIA agent, had a liaison to all of those mobs. And [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2337.3799999999997s)]
*  that guy was named Johnny Rizzelli. And Johnny Rizzelli was actually murdered, I think in 73, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2349.4599999999996s)]
*  when Congress reopened the Warren Commission. And it's called the Church Committee. And they [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2359.22s)]
*  tried to, actually Gary Hardew, I've talked to about this, they subpoenaed Johnny Rizzelli. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2366.5s)]
*  He was supposed to come talk to the committee and he never showed up. And then his body was found [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2373.46s)]
*  in a 55 gallon oil drum, chopped into pieces, floating at Biscayne Bay. But he had also been [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2378.98s)]
*  involved in a weird way in my father's destiny. Now I always thought that my father, that Sarand [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2386.74s)]
*  killed my father. Can we give a little context to your father's death? Okay. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2394.42s)]
*  My father, in 1960, ran my uncle's campaign. It was my, my grandfather Joseph Kennedy [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2401.06s)]
*  made a lot of money in banking and in owning a studio, one of the biggest studios. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2414.1s)]
*  He was making films. I didn't even realize that. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2420.98s)]
*  He was a big filmmaker. They weren't good films. They were family films at that time. And it was [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2422.82s)]
*  like Tarzan and, but all clean, you know, that you can show in theaters across the Midwest. That was [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2429.86s)]
*  his business plan. It was, it was part of RKO. My grandfather, after my uncle's death, my CIA [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2435.86s)]
*  tried to smear my grandfather by starting this rumor that he had been a bootlegger. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2445.8599999999997s)]
*  That's what I was about to ask. He was never a bootlegger. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2450.98s)]
*  So this was, to me, common knowledge my whole life. I was like, yeah, Kennedy's made that money. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2453.54s)]
*  And then I start doing some research on you and I find out that there was money made in alcohol, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2458.1s)]
*  but it was through exclusive deals when prohibition dropped. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2463.14s)]
*  Yeah, he and Jimmy Roosevelt, who was the president's son, when they knew, because the [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2466.2599999999998s)]
*  way that they got rid of prohibition, you had to get, I think 26 states had to, had to reject, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2472.26s)]
*  was it the 16th Amendment or 17th Amendment, the one that, you know, illegalized it. So you had to [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2480.98s)]
*  have state by state adopt laws saying we want to get rid of that prohibition and want to get close [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2486.6600000000003s)]
*  to the end. And they knew they were going to win it. My grandfather and Jimmy Roosevelt went [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2496.82s)]
*  over to Scotland and they bought Pinch, which was a very high quality band of Scotch. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2503.3s)]
*  And they took all the inventory and they shipped it over to warehouses on the Canadian border with [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2510.34s)]
*  the U.S. So it was ready to go. The night that prohibition ended, they were shipping high quality [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2514.82s)]
*  whiskey to everybody, but that's his only involvement with it. And then I think he sold that [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2520.26s)]
*  company later on for a lot of money. He was conscience stricken about it. Oh, really? Yeah. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2525.22s)]
*  He didn't think he should be selling alcohol. And he sold it not for religious purposes or because [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2532.58s)]
*  it was just, yeah, it was like a sin. It was a sin enterprise, essentially, what they'd call a sin [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2540.2599999999998s)]
*  enterprise. And he didn't, you know, he made a lot of statements about, I don't feel good about this. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2549.46s)]
*  So he overcorrects and starts making family films, which suck, apparently. Well, I don't think he was [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2556.02s)]
*  making family films for, I don't know, you know, whether he was making for moral reasons or whether [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2561.54s)]
*  it was just a marketing strategy. There were all these theaters in the Midwest that didn't want to [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2567.94s)]
*  see women in stockings, you know, see their ankles, right? And that kind of stuff. He was Tyler Perry [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2574.58s)]
*  before Tyler Perry. Exactly. Okay, so CIA starts to smear. So after he died, there was a guy who [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2579.62s)]
*  worked for the CIA, had been an Annaberg bureau chief for the New York Times, and his job for the [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2588.5s)]
*  next 30 years was, was smearing my family. And he's working for the Times. He was, well, no, he had [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2594.82s)]
*  been, he had been, his cover had been New York Times bureau chief in Havana before he just came [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2602.26s)]
*  out of the closet and said, Oh, I actually worked for the CIA. Wow. And then he transferred to [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2610.6600000000003s)]
*  Langley and that was his job. And there was a whole cottage industry of Kennedy books that came out. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2616.0200000000004s)]
*  And he's the one that started this rumor that my uncle or that they had, my family, my grandfather [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2622.74s)]
*  had gotten Sam Giancana to fix the election in Chicago. I've seen an entire one hour documentary [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2633.7s)]
*  about it. So that is all baloney. And if you think about it, when I was, and then, and then [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2641.7s)]
*  Giancana was angry because my father tried to put him in jail. My father had six FBI agents follow [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2648.98s)]
*  him. And when he got, when he left his home in the morning, they'd sit behind him in the movie [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2655.22s)]
*  theaters. They get the table next to him when he went out, they ruined his life. And so, but [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2659.3s)]
*  the thing is, when I was a kid, like maybe six or five or six year old kids, there's pictures of me [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2667.3s)]
*  sitting on my mother's lap in the front row of the rackets committee hearing, which my father [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2675.78s)]
*  was Ryan. My uncle was a Senator. He was the head of that committee. My father was his council. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2681.46s)]
*  And my father, I'm grilling Sam Giancana. I was there. Giancana took the fifth amendment over a [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2687.0600000000004s)]
*  hundred times. My father was ridiculing him and saying, you know, he said, do you hang people? Is [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2695.2200000000003s)]
*  it true that you hang your enemies on meat hooks? And Giancana laughed. And my father said to him, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2700.82s)]
*  you're giggling like a little girl. So they hated each other. So now, you know, what this room, [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2708.42s)]
*  this is, this is one year before the election. He's doing that to Giancana. The idea that Giancana, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2715.94s)]
*  my father would then go bribe Giancana to fix the- [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2726.02s)]
*  One year before JFK won the election? [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2728.98s)]
*  Yeah. And my father ran the campaign for him. So the idea that my father would go from that [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2730.9s)]
*  hearing room where, you know, the mob hated him, that somehow he would convince the mob to now- [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2737.46s)]
*  To fix the election. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2743.78s)]
*  To fix the election. Now, was the election in Chicago fixed? Probably. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2744.6600000000003s)]
*  How? How? [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2749.2200000000003s)]
*  Well, because Daley fixed all the elections. And- [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2750.1s)]
*  Daley, you said? [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2753.54s)]
*  Mayor Daley. He fixed the Democratic elections in Chicago, and the Republicans fixed them in [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2754.5s)]
*  Southern Illinois. So they were all fixed. And in fact, they would wait for each other. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2762.7400000000002s)]
*  What does that mean, fix? Explain, like, how do you do that? [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2767.78s)]
*  You have dead people voting, have, you know, all of the different ways to get rid of ballots. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2770.42s)]
*  You know, a million different ways. I mean, they found ballots in the Chicago River. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2776.02s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2779.46s)]
*  So, but they were mainly interested in the down ballot [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2780.98s)]
*  contest. So, judge- [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2786.66s)]
*  Down ballot means Southern- [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2787.86s)]
*  Judge is, you know, the people who were governing Chicago, that's what he was [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2788.9s)]
*  mainly interested in. But here's the thing. When the election was over, some of the Republicans [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2796.7400000000002s)]
*  said, oh, they fixed it. So Daley said, let's do a recount of the entire state, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2806.26s)]
*  and I will personally pay for the recount. And the Republican election, [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2812.82s)]
*  election commission was run by Republicans, voted unanimously to not do that. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2817.94s)]
*  Why? [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2824.0200000000004s)]
*  Because they, probably because they knew that an account would- [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2824.82s)]
*  We both get exposed. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2828.82s)]
*  Disclose everybody. And, but here, the bottom line punchline is that even if my [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2829.46s)]
*  uncle had lost Illinois, he would have still won the election. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2836.5s)]
*  Still won the election. Okay. Okay. So, okay. So that's another CIA smear. Why is the CIA, [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2840.9s)]
*  why do they hate you guys so much? [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2846.82s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a break for a second. I need to point something out how the UFC has [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2848.1800000000003s)]
*  made me a better predictor of basketball outcomes. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2851.78s)]
*  Talk to me. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2857.3s)]
*  Okay. I wish that there was a way that like the line adjusted super quickly, but this was [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2858.1800000000003s)]
*  a few nights ago, the Knicks were playing, Jalen Brunson suffers like what they believe is a non [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2862.98s)]
*  contact knee injury. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2869.6200000000003s)]
*  Scary. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2870.98s)]
*  Right? Very scary. That's all like almost always you're like, okay, that's ACL or something like [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2871.6200000000003s)]
*  that. And he tries to lift up his leg and his leg is kind of like labored in his ability to lift [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2876.1000000000004s)]
*  it up and his foot is almost like dead. He has like a dropped foot, so he can't move his foot. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2883.38s)]
*  Everybody in the group chat immediately is like, oh my God, Jalen toward the ACL, it's over, like [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2887.86s)]
*  a knee injury. This looks bad. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2893.78s)]
*  You're a Knicks fan, you're prepared for the worst. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2895.1400000000003s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2896.9s)]
*  I go, I think that he banged his perennial nerve, which is what we saw happen to Izzy, [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2897.6200000000003s)]
*  happened to this fighter, Crute. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2904.9s)]
*  Isn't that what happened to Sugar Sean in that one fight? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2906.7400000000002s)]
*  Sugar Sean or Sugar might have actually broken his foot. I'm not exactly sure, but like, [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2908.5800000000004s)]
*  but there is this injury that happens when you bang the side of your knee, [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2912.9s)]
*  your perennial nerve swells and then you lose the ability to kind of like move your ankle. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2916.82s)]
*  Imagine I could have, imagine in that moment, the line for the Knicks adjusted like crazy [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2922.1s)]
*  because without their superstar, they don't have a chance. But I know. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2929.2200000000003s)]
*  You know. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2932.34s)]
*  I should have taken advantage of it. Anyway, I did not take advantage of it, but right now we [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2932.7400000000002s)]
*  get to take advantage of Akash Singh's picks. The Akash Singh locks. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2937.3s)]
*  That's the beauty of prize picks. You don't need to have years of four, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2940.9799999999996s)]
*  seven months of force. You just pick once and leave it alone. So here's your picks for tonight. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2943.8599999999997s)]
*  Singh locks for tonight. Alex Caruso, more than eight points against the Kings. I believe that [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2947.9399999999996s)]
*  they're not the strongest defensive team. Marvin Bagley Jr. I got him getting less than 21 and a [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2952.74s)]
*  half points plus rebounds. And I got Demar DeRozan making less than half a three. I love Demar DeRozan. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2957.9399999999996s)]
*  I just don't know. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2963.54s)]
*  You don't think he's going to hit a three? [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2964.02s)]
*  I just don't, I just don't know to be a three point shooter. I'm trying. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2965.3799999999997s)]
*  He hit one three. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2968.1s)]
*  I was the least positive about this one, but the multiplier goes up with price picks, the more you [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2969.38s)]
*  pick. I would go more on that one. You go more, I go less. Let's see what happens. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2973.54s)]
*  We'll see what happens. 100%. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2977.94s)]
*  All right. PricePicks.com. Tell them about the promo code. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2978.98s)]
*  Yeah, promo code Schultz, S-E-H-U-L-Z. They're going to match your initial deposit bonus of $100. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2981.3s)]
*  So if you put up to 100, they put in 100. You go get that bread. Let's get back to the show. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2986.42s)]
*  Why is the CIA, why do they hate you guys so much? What is it about the Kennedy's? [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2990.82s)]
*  There was a fit and I wrote a book about this, this is a 60 year fistfight between my, [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=2995.22s)]
*  my family and the CIA. It started, I think in 1955, my uncle was appointed to a commission [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3000.2599999999998s)]
*  by run by what's called a Hoover commission that looked at what the CIA was doing. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3010.3399999999997s)]
*  And the CIA originally was created as an espionage agency. It wasn't supposed to do dirty tricks. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3017.7s)]
*  Aspionage means spying. It means data collection and analytics. And that's why it was started. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3022.74s)]
*  Abroad, right? Not at home. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3030.02s)]
*  Its charter forbids it from operating in the United States, from propagandizing Americans, [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3032.3399999999997s)]
*  from doing anything in this country. Yes. Which it violates constantly. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3037.3799999999997s)]
*  But its charter prohibits that. So it wasn't supposed to do dirty tricks. And it's Mitch, [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3043.7799999999997s)]
*  Alan Dulles, who was essentially the first director manipulated. And he had been at the OSS, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3050.58s)]
*  which is the precursor to, yeah. But the, after the war, Congress and the Senate, [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3058.42s)]
*  Republicans, Democrats said, we can't, we can't have a secret spy agency in this country. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3066.58s)]
*  Because that's what totalitarian regimes do. That's the Stasi in East Germany. It's a KGB, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3073.2999999999997s)]
*  it's PEEP in Chile, it's SAVAK in Iran. And the only totalitarian regimes have spy agencies. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3079.38s)]
*  So, and everybody agreed on that. And then Truman got in there and realized, okay, now we have one [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3086.6600000000003s)]
*  big bomb, right? That we can drop on the rest of the world. But you can't do that in all of these [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3095.62s)]
*  little contact, these little brush fire rebellions that are happening. We have to have a way to fight [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3103.62s)]
*  these wars without dropping the bomb on everybody. So they realized the cheapest way to do that is [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3109.14s)]
*  let the CIA go. Handle all that. To fix the elections, to assassinate leaders. They weren't [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3116.8199999999997s)]
*  supposed to assassinate anybody, but they started almost immediately. Who was number one that they [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3121.8599999999997s)]
*  took out? Well, they deposed Mohammed Mosaddegh in 1953. So the agency was started in 47. And they [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3127.06s)]
*  began immediately overthrowing governments. The two most famous ones are Mosaddegh in 53 in Iran. He [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3137.86s)]
*  was the first democratically elected leader of Iran in its 8,000 year history. And then the next [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3144.26s)]
*  year they overthrew. And they did that because he loved the United States, Mosaddegh. And in fact, [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3153.86s)]
*  he threw the British out because he thought Churchill was trying to overthrow him. And his [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3159.86s)]
*  his aides were saying the US is going to do it too. And he said, no, the US is a [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3165.78s)]
*  was a colonial nation itself. And it threw it off. And they're idealist. And they're on our side. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3171.7s)]
*  He made a big mistake. Dulles sent Kermit Roosevelt over there and they overthrew him. And then the [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3176.98s)]
*  next year they because Dulles before he was at the CIA had been a lawyer at the Sullivan Cromwell. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3183.22s)]
*  And Texco is one of his clients. His biggest client was United Fruit. And the next year, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3192.98s)]
*  Jacobo Arbenz nationalized United Fruit in Guatemala. And so they went down and overthrew [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3200.8199999999997s)]
*  him the next year. And then they overthrew multiple governments in the next two years in Syria, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3208.66s)]
*  in Iraq, and all over the Middle East in order to control the oil. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3215.62s)]
*  The incentive structure for overthrowing these governments, is it always monetary in terms of [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3220.18s)]
*  businesses that have been purchased out there or there's investing interest in the business [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3226.66s)]
*  out there like it was in Guatemala, or as part of destabilization, just like global colonial power, [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3232.3399999999997s)]
*  and this is how we need to keep things. I mean, David Talbot, who wrote the best book about Dulles, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3238.4199999999996s)]
*  it's called Devil's Chess Board, it's really riveting book. If you start reading that book, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3245.94s)]
*  you will not put it down. It's really, it's so crazy. But what he says in that book is that [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3250.58s)]
*  Dulles was incapable of distinguishing between American interests and the interests of the [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3257.14s)]
*  corporations who he had represented at the Sullivan Cromwell. He honestly believed [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3263.06s)]
*  though whatever was good for US corporations was good. And you know, the CIA still has [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3268.5s)]
*  I mean, that's what it does. It does regime change. It mainly funnels the money through USAID, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3275.94s)]
*  which is a CIA puppet. I mean, they overthrew the government of Ukraine in 2014, which is really [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3281.38s)]
*  what this war is about. They spent $5 billion dollars overthrowing that government and putting [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3287.78s)]
*  in handpicking the US government, which Victoria Nuland, who's the Deputy Secretary of State, [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3294.26s)]
*  they have her now, you can go and listen to this on the internet, her giving orders of a voice mail [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3300.58s)]
*  of her voice recording of her giving orders to the US ambassador of Ukraine a month before the coup, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3310.74s)]
*  in which she's picking the cabinet, the new cabinet. So this, you know, obviously upset the Russians [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3319.86s)]
*  because they don't want US weapons systems in Ukraine. Okay, that makes sense. Now, [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3326.58s)]
*  did the Russians support the democratically elected government that the Americans overthrew? [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3333.38s)]
*  No, no, in Ukraine. Oh, in Ukraine before 2013. Yeah, I mean, that- Like is it possible that they [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3343.06s)]
*  also have information systems to prop up- Well, that was democratically elected. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3350.5s)]
*  But I mean, is it- Is that in quotes, democratically elected? Is it possible? [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3356.26s)]
*  No, the thing is that a large percentage of Ukrainians are Russian, are ethnic Russians, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3362.34s)]
*  Abbas, Lugansk, Crimea, 90% of the people there. And when, you know, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3370.2599999999998s)]
*  after we overthrew their government and then, you know, started killing ethnic Russians, [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3382.66s)]
*  killed 14, the new government killed 14,000, illegalized language, killed 14,000 Russians. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3388.5s)]
*  And, you know, that's when Putin invaded Ukraine because, I mean, invaded Crimea, because Crimea, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3396.66s)]
*  Vladivostok is the biggest Russian port. It's the only warm water port. And he saw, okay, [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3407.2999999999997s)]
*  they're going to invite the US Navy in there and take away our port that's been ours for 347 years. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3414.98s)]
*  And that was untenable for their national security. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3420.98s)]
*  I'm not defending Putin. I don't think he's a good guy, but I think it's important for Americans [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3427.38s)]
*  to understand our role and the provocations that led up to the war. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3432.82s)]
*  What did you think of Putin's- And by the way, my son fought in the war. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3437.6200000000003s)]
*  Oh, really? Yeah. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3441.6200000000003s)]
*  What did you think of Putin's interview with Tucker? [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3443.38s)]
*  I thought it was fascinating. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3446.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3448.8199999999997s)]
*  Elaborate on that. What did you think? [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3450.18s)]
*  Well, I think, I mean, he didn't say anything that surprised me, but he, you know, he just, [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3452.98s)]
*  he talked about, I mean, one thing, he confirmed something that we already know. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3460.98s)]
*  Which? [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3466.98s)]
*  Which is on two occasions, they had made these very generous peace offers. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3468.02s)]
*  The Minsk agreements? [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3474.02s)]
*  The first one was the Minsk Accords, and then again in April of 2022. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3475.3s)]
*  And what he said is, we signed that agreement. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3480.02s)]
*  And we, you know, the major objective for Russia was at the time was making us [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3483.38s)]
*  not move NATO into Ukraine. They don't want NATO there. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3494.02s)]
*  And that's really what this war is about. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3498.98s)]
*  And he said, he said, I, you know, we signed the agreement. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3501.94s)]
*  And the principal part of the agreement was that NATO would not go into Ukraine. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3506.98s)]
*  And I was withdrawing from Kiev, which we knew. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3511.22s)]
*  But he said, as soon as I started withdrawing groups, troops from Kiev, [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3515.54s)]
*  they double crossed us. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3520.74s)]
*  And, you know, Biden sent Boris Johnson over there to force Zelensky to tear up the peace [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3522.02s)]
*  agreement. And since then, 450,000 Ukrainian kids have died in a war that should have never happened. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3528.9s)]
*  Now, who's profiting from this war? If all of our... [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3534.42s)]
*  Well, if you look at why, why did we want to extend NATO? [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3538.02s)]
*  So, you know, in 1992, when the wall came down in Berlin, [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3542.6600000000003s)]
*  and the Soviet Union collapse, Gorbachev went to John Major in England and Bush [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3549.54s)]
*  in the United States and said, look, I'm going to let you do something that [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3556.58s)]
*  I'm never going to be able to go back to Russia, because the Russian people are going to hate me so much. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3560.5s)]
*  I'm going to allow you to reunify Germany, East and West Germany, under a NATO army. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3566.74s)]
*  I'm going to move out 450,000 Russian troops. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3572.9s)]
*  And I'm going to hand it over to you. But I want one promise from you. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3576.66s)]
*  You will not move NATO to the East after that. You'll be satisfied with that. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3579.94s)]
*  So five years later, and James Baker, famously, who was the secretary of state under Bush, [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3584.8199999999997s)]
*  famously said, promise Gorbachev, we will not move NATO one inch to the East. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3592.2599999999998s)]
*  But what happened five years later, the neocons came into power and the US government led by [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3597.54s)]
*  Zbigniew Brzezinski, and they published a plan saying we're going to surround Russia with NATO. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3602.4199999999996s)]
*  George Cannon, who is the most important diplomat, arguably in American history, [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3608.5s)]
*  he was the architect of the containment policy during the Cold War, said if you do that, [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3614.02s)]
*  you're going to force a violent response to Russia. Why are you treating Russia as an enemy? [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3619.38s)]
*  You should do a Marshall Plan with Russia and bring them into the community of nations. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3623.3s)]
*  Why do you need a permanent enemy there? I'll give you, take a shortcut and tell you. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3627.46s)]
*  No, no, take as long as you want here. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3633.62s)]
*  One of the, when we bring a new nation into NATO, the first part of that contract is that [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3634.98s)]
*  that new nation has to conform its weapons purchases to NATO specifications, which means [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3646.02s)]
*  they have to buy their weapons from Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, Blocky Martin, [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3654.5s)]
*  and all of those companies are owned by BlackRock. And BlackRock is the base. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3660.58s)]
*  So they're incentivized to expand NATO because the only way that they can increase their profits [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3667.78s)]
*  if they get more countries that have signed up. Well, it's a whole market that they now have a [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3671.3s)]
*  trap market that they can only buy from them. It's like Starbucks selling frappuccinos. It's [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3675.78s)]
*  like you want Starbucks everywhere. And the, oh my God. Every coffee shop should be a Starbucks. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3680.34s)]
*  Yes. And we break into a new market. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3685.7s)]
*  It's a confluence of ideological and economic incentives that, you know. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3692.74s)]
*  And this seems like what is often happening in the United States where the corporate interests [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3698.2599999999998s)]
*  match up with the geopolitical interests, which are America wants to exert force against our enemies [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3703.14s)]
*  and the corporations want to get as much profit as possible. So they probably align themselves [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3709.14s)]
*  in that way. Exactly. Could you argue that that does end up benefiting the American economy? [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3713.54s)]
*  And I'm not necessarily like a trickle down guy. I'm not a trickle down guy, but people who would [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3719.22s)]
*  believe that putting billions of dollars into corporations in America does end up benefiting [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3724.5s)]
*  the U.S. citizens according to that line of thinking. Yeah, it creates a lot of jobs in our [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3730.02s)]
*  country in one industry, the defense industry. And, you know, that's now our biggest export [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3734.74s)]
*  around the world. Does it benefit us over the long run? I would say no. That, you know, we need to [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3742.1s)]
*  rebuild our industrial base and it allows the financialization of the American economy [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3749.7799999999997s)]
*  because the economy is now no longer based upon industrial production or any kind of production. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3755.38s)]
*  It's based upon speculation. So everybody is, if you look at what's happening on Wall Street, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3762.02s)]
*  they're no longer going factory by factory and saying, what's the production? What's the [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3768.66s)]
*  efficiency? What's the lowest cost? What's the future? They're all focusing on what is the Fed [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3772.74s)]
*  going to do this week? Yeah. Right. And that's what everybody bets on. And it's financialized [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3779.22s)]
*  our economy. It's sent all of their industry. It's destroyed abroad. Yeah. It's destroyed the [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3784.02s)]
*  American middle class. And we do that by printing dollars. You print $34 trillion of dollars that [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3790.66s)]
*  you don't have. Why would the world even value them anymore? And the reason that they continue [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3799.06s)]
*  to value them is because our mill, we have 800 bases abroad and that kind of anchors this whole [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3804.42s)]
*  system. The system is going to collapse. It's not sustainable. It is corrupt. And it's not, [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3810.5s)]
*  and it's already destroyed our moral authority around the world. And it now, our influence [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3818.98s)]
*  around the world is this big compared to when I was a kid. When we had moral suasion and we also [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3823.54s)]
*  had, you know, people wanted American leadership. Now they considered bullying. And it's not [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3831.46s)]
*  sustainable. The national debt is now just the service on the debt is now larger than our military [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3839.86s)]
*  budget. Put, you know, just that. And if the interest rate, if interest rates raise. Service [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3847.94s)]
*  meaning the interest on the interest on the big. So yeah, the big. Yeah. So what we're paying is [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3855.14s)]
*  bigger than $1.3 trillion. And if interest rates go up, like if interest rates got doubled from, [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3862.5s)]
*  let's say they go from 2% to 4%, that interest rate, that service doubles. Yeah. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3870.1s)]
*  It goes from 1.3 trillion to 2.6 trillion. And all you need, if you get up to the typical interest [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3877.8599999999997s)]
*  rates, which are eight or 10%, it's the entire, every tax dollar collected in our country is going [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3883.7s)]
*  to service the debt. That's happening right now. And it's not, you know, it's not sustainable. And [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3891.14s)]
*  all of that is attached to the, you know, the warfare state. Do you think there's a path to [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3898.1s)]
*  redemption and getting the sway that you had that the U S had when you were a kid? And if so, what is [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3904.74s)]
*  it? Yeah. I mean, I think I don't want to be, you know, plugging myself here. I think if I'm elected, [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3910.2599999999998s)]
*  we're going to, how do you, how do you reverse it? I think first of all, the world wants to see that, [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3917.62s)]
*  you know, America and America that they used to say, which is America, that is a moral authority, [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3924.66s)]
*  America that's telling the truth to people on every issue. An America that comes with a little [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3930.5s)]
*  bit of humility. That is not, you know, where I mean, I'm going to, I'm going to stop the CIA from [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3937.54s)]
*  the regime change operations and say, you know, it's we actually do support democracy. We're not, [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3947.06s)]
*  if somebody elects a leader, they ought to be able to serve. And, you know, it's not the U S [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3954.26s)]
*  choice to do that. And I, you know, I'll end that, but I, across the board, I'm the corporate [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3960.5s)]
*  corruption, this corrupt merger of state and corporate power happens within the agencies. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3968.1000000000004s)]
*  The agencies are now all have become sock puppets for the industries they're supposed to regulate. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3972.9s)]
*  And this is, we have Vivek on it. He spoke about this. He used the term managerial class. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3978.1000000000004s)]
*  And I like the term because deep state is this like nefarious entity, but it's so conspiratorial [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3983.46s)]
*  that like, I feel like people don't take it as serious as they should. You kind of like write [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3988.58s)]
*  off the word deep state. Like what is a deep state? I don't know who it is. I don't use that term for [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3993.06s)]
*  that reason. What is the term that you would use for it? Because I do think that you're tapping into [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=3997.54s)]
*  a feeling and sensation. A lot of Americans have, whether they're disillusioned with government and [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4004.34s)]
*  the people in control and they feel like their desires are not being met by candidates is [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4008.34s)]
*  probably why you've had so much success because you're speaking to a lot of the frustrations [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4012.1800000000003s)]
*  that Americans have. So what is that term that we use for the powers to be that are not elected, [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4016.42s)]
*  but able to exert immense force and control, i.e. the people at the CIA. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4022.26s)]
*  I think Vivek's term is pretty good as a managerial class. I mean, there are entities [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4028.02s)]
*  within the government that are actually dictating a lot of this stuff. Like whom? [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4034.66s)]
*  I would say probably most, particularly with our foreign policy, the Atlantic Council. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4042.8999999999996s)]
*  I mean, just go look at who's on it. There are six former CIA chiefs on the Atlantic Council. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4053.14s)]
*  These are elected officials or? No. And who appoints them? [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4060.66s)]
*  They're appointed by invitation. Who is inviting? The Atlantic Council. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4069.14s)]
*  What I'm trying to understand is how do these positions of power, [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4074.8999999999996s)]
*  where do they come from? Who creates them? How does the Atlantic Council even get power? [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4080.18s)]
*  Yeah. What? [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4085.54s)]
*  How does the Atlantic Council even get power? Can you just break this down for [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4086.74s)]
*  simplest possible terms? How does this get started? Who starts it? [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4089.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean, there are a lot of different centers of power and I'm just saying this is one of them [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4094.18s)]
*  because it dictates US foreign policy and it dictates policy at NATO. These people are all [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4100.82s)]
*  highly respected. They tell the president, oh yeah, Vladimir Putin is a crazy person. He's about to [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4111.139999999999s)]
*  invade all of Europe. We need to be over there and we need to go to war with him. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4117.06s)]
*  And they not only influence the US government, but they are the primary body that influences NATO. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4124.02s)]
*  There's other things that counts on foreign relations. And then there are panels across [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4131.780000000001s)]
*  the government that are made up of industry people, people within who are, [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4138.58s)]
*  and you can look at them in every agency. In FDA, it's called VRBPAC and the CDC is called [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4148.66s)]
*  ASEP, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. And if you look at the people who [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4155.62s)]
*  sit on it, they're all people who are profiting from this, not from making people healthier, [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4164.0199999999995s)]
*  but from making from a sick country and a country that's constantly at war and a country that [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4171.3s)]
*  is doing the opposite of what its ideals say it's supposed to be doing. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4180.0199999999995s)]
*  How would you stop corporate influence in government institutions? [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4184.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, the worst thing that happened in terms of corporate influence was the [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4188.02s)]
*  Citizens United case. And it's hard to fix that. And just so that you know what Citizens United is, [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4193.9400000000005s)]
*  we lost democracy at one point in our history in the 1880s and 1890s. Our country was being [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4202.26s)]
*  run by corporate plutocracy and it was John D. Rockefeller, the Melons, the Cornigies, [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4208.34s)]
*  the Fricks, the Whitney's. And they all sat on interlocking boards for the Sugar Trust, [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4215.06s)]
*  the Rail Trust, the Steel Trust, the Oil Trust, etc. And at that time, there was no direct election [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4221.22s)]
*  of senators. The senators were not chosen by the public, they were chosen by the legislators. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4228.660000000001s)]
*  The legislators were completely owned, the state legislators by Congress, I mean, by these guys. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4233.46s)]
*  In fact, it was said that the only legislatures that could not be purchased [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4239.62s)]
*  was the Pennsylvania state legislature because John D. Rockefeller owned them all and he wasn't [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4247.62s)]
*  selling any. Wow. And so they would then pick the senators and everybody from top to bottom was [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4251.94s)]
*  chosen by this group. Didn't Rockefeller bail out the entire country with a check? Didn't you tell [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4259.22s)]
*  me this story? One of these guys, the US needed money and he was like, yeah, just write you a check. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4264.0199999999995s)]
*  Different time, but maybe during, I think a bunch of them actually came together. This is before, [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4269.14s)]
*  this is during, right before the Great Depression. They just dumped a bunch of money in the stock [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4275.0599999999995s)]
*  market to try to regulate it, but different than what we're talking about. But go on, go on. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4278.26s)]
*  So then you had a confluence of these extraordinary events that happened. You had [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4284.9s)]
*  the rise in the countryside of the populist movement, which was democratic. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4289.62s)]
*  Can I just say one thing real quick? So when you have these people, the billionaires, [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4293.62s)]
*  the aristocracy, owning the legislative branch, they're dictating the laws in the country, [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4299.22s)]
*  essentially. Yeah, they were dictating the laws and they were also dictating the personnel. But [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4307.0599999999995s)]
*  I'll just do this very briefly. So you had two big movements that happened. One was Republican, [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4311.86s)]
*  one was Democrat populists in the countryside that were organizing farmers, which were then a [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4317.7s)]
*  huge part of the population, the progressives in the city. And you had all suddenly appear all [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4322.5s)]
*  these muckraking journalists who really changed America. Ida Tarbell, Optin Sinclair, Sinclair [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4328.82s)]
*  Lewis, and many others. They were writing for a magazine called McClure's and they started doing [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4334.58s)]
*  ex-visaes on John D. Rockfell and all the other robber parents. And America, everybody was reading [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4340.18s)]
*  those magazines. Everybody, the whole middle class was reading it and there's a sense of indignation. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4345.7s)]
*  And then you had one guy came along, Teddy Roosevelt, who was a member of the Arab [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4350.42s)]
*  plutocracy. And he wasn't intimidated by him. And he got elected president and started to dismantle [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4356.82s)]
*  and they passed the Sherman Antitrust Act and he broke up Standard Oil, the biggest company in the [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4363.38s)]
*  world. They passed the 40-hour work week. They let unions start to organize. They gave women the vote. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4369.7s)]
*  They passed corporate income tax for the first time. They graduated income tax for the first time. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4377.86s)]
*  The most important bill they passed was in 1908. They passed a law that made it illegal for [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4387.78s)]
*  corporations to give to federal political candidates. So that stood for 102 years. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4394.5s)]
*  And then Citizens United. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4400.66s)]
*  And then Citizens United, this very business-friendly supreme court. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4401.86s)]
*  In 2010 came and said that donations are free speech. They're protected by the First Amendment [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4406.74s)]
*  and you can't do anything to interfere with them. And that's the court we got today. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4417.219999999999s)]
*  So it's really hard to fix that part of it, which is the systemic part because it unleashed the [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4421.94s)]
*  synonyms. So I'm running against Biden and Trump and both of them are going to have $2 billion. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4428.5s)]
*  So just to clarify why this is difficult, you have a situation before where these billionaires or [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4434.42s)]
*  corporations, if you will, the owners of these corporations are dictating the laws because they [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4438.9s)]
*  own the legislative branch of government. They own Congress, right? Teddy dismantles it. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4442.9s)]
*  102 years later, Citizens United essentially allows corporations to fund candidates. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4449.38s)]
*  And now it's almost impossible to beat a corporately funded candidate. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4455.54s)]
*  So you're back in the same system that Teddy had to break. Real quick question about Teddy, [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4460.339999999999s)]
*  is that why Teddy kind of has a shaky reputation historically? [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4466.179999999999s)]
*  Have they tried to smear him a little bit? He's some weirdo that likes to go out to, [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4470.74s)]
*  where was it, hang out in the forest for months at a time. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4474.9s)]
*  I think he's actually, according to public polls, one of the most popular presidents in history. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4478.58s)]
*  I mean, progressives don't like him. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4485.94s)]
*  Of course. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4488.9s)]
*  Because he was a warmonger and he was an American imperialist and he bullied his way around the [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4489.94s)]
*  Philippines, built the Panama Canal and then took over Cuba. They sent people down to help [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4498.0199999999995s)]
*  with the Cuban insurrection against Spain. But in the end, he told the Cubans, oh, and by the way, [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4510.58s)]
*  we're keeping Guantanamo Bay, which is your biggest port. That's how we got Guantanamo Bay. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4517.78s)]
*  And he did the same thing. He took over the Philippines and Guam. And so people think of [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4526.099999999999s)]
*  him as an imperialist, but I think generally his reputation has withstood the test of time. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4532.9s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a break for a second. Listen, you guys have some bad habits, [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4541.38s)]
*  maybe one bad habit in particular you need to quit. And you're going to give yourself [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4545.14s)]
*  lung cancer or emphysema with that bad habit. I want you to stop. I want you to stop that bad [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4549.780000000001s)]
*  habit. How do you beat a bad habit? You maybe replace it with a good one. Fume is that good [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4554.5s)]
*  habit. Okay, so it doesn't feel like you're just quitting cold turkey and brutally shaking through [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4561.46s)]
*  your day. You have that same physical sensation going on with none of those negative side effects. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4567.14s)]
*  I'm telling you, fume is an innovative award-winning flavored air device that does just that. Instead of [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4572.9s)]
*  vapor, fume uses flavored air. Instead of electronics, fume is completely natural. Instead [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4578.42s)]
*  of harmful chemicals, fume uses delicious flavors. You got all these different flavors. I'm telling [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4582.42s)]
*  you, you take the hit, pull, it calms that desire, that sensation that you are addicted to. You have [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4587.7s)]
*  a very bad habit, and this is going to help you with that. I'm telling you, the taste is fantastic. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4598.66s)]
*  I prefer the mint. That's the one I go. They have plenty of different flavors. You guys choose [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4604.18s)]
*  whatever you want. The feel, this is a nice feel to it. It also satisfies that little fidgety. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4608.34s)]
*  The click. I love the click. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4614.42s)]
*  Yeah, the click is nice. The click is nice. It gives you something to do for those ADD brains. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4615.62s)]
*  Fume just released the magnetic stand for your fume as well, so there's no more losing it around [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4620.66s)]
*  the house. It's built with fidgeting in mind. Remember, so you can spin it all you want. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4625.78s)]
*  Start the year off right. The good habit is going to be fume. Tryfume.com slash flagrant. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4630.0199999999995s)]
*  The website is tryfume.com slash flagrant. That is F-U-M for fume. Getting the journey pack right [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4637.86s)]
*  now when you go to tryfume.com slash flagrant, fume is going to give the listeners of this show [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4645.46s)]
*  10% off when they use the code flagrant. Okay. So use fume. Start that good habit. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4650.58s)]
*  Let's get back to the show. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4656.58s)]
*  All right, guys, we're going to take a break real quick because your bank sucks, [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4657.78s)]
*  probably. How do I know? Because most banks sucks. That's why you need Current. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4661.38s)]
*  Current actually helps you build your credit, get your paychecks faster, [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4665.62s)]
*  and gives you a great interest rate on your savings. We're going to start with this. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4669.7s)]
*  You see what this is? This is the Build card from Current, and here's why it's great. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4673.14s)]
*  It's a secured credit card that lets you use your own money to build up your credit. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4678.9s)]
*  What that means is it functions kind of like a debit card. You buy shit using your money, [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4683.0599999999995s)]
*  not the credit companies. But while a normal debit card doesn't have any effects on your [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4688.259999999999s)]
*  credit score, the Build card reports all of your purchases to credit companies, [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4692.9s)]
*  so it helps you build your credit score. The Build card reports all your purchases, [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4697.0599999999995s)]
*  like I said, and there's no credit check or history required to get this card. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4701.299999999999s)]
*  So if you are looking to improve your credit score, this is the card for you. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4705.3s)]
*  I know people who use it and love it, and you will too. On top of all that, [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4709.54s)]
*  when you switch to Current and set up a direct deposit, you can get paid up to two days faster. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4713.54s)]
*  Guys, it's your money. You worked hard for it. Now get it faster. And maybe most important, [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4718.18s)]
*  you can get up to 4% interest on your savings with Current. Guys, how much more of a no-brainer can [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4721.860000000001s)]
*  we make it? So guys, what are you waiting for? Get Current, the future of banking. Go to [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4726.5s)]
*  current.com slash flagrant or download the app that is current.com. C-U-R-R-E-N-T dot com slash [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4731.62s)]
*  flagrant. Terms apply. Are you guys the class clowns in here? No. More school shooter vibe. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4738.58s)]
*  Yeah. Get the job done. I was a class virgin. Okay. All right. And we're back. We're back. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4753.7s)]
*  We took a little pee break. I think we're all kind of still digesting this. This is kind of crazy. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4764.9s)]
*  Okay. So would you immediately tear apart Citizens United? [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4770.5s)]
*  Well, that's the problem is you can't do that as president. I mean, that's now the constitution. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4775.54s)]
*  Right. The only thing that's going to fix that is if all of these Supreme Court justices, [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4780.58s)]
*  after they get old and retire or die and new ones come on and say, yeah, this is not a good system. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4787.14s)]
*  The First Amendment does not protect legalized bribery, which is what a campaign donation is. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4796.82s)]
*  Now let's say, for example, we strip it down, get rid of it, tear it up. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4803.78s)]
*  And each citizen can only donate up to $10,000 to a candidate or whatever that number is. We can [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4808.58s)]
*  adjust that number. Doesn't that incentivize the wealthy to run? Because now they can spend their [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4813.219999999999s)]
*  own money. Whereas some poor dude who wants to be president doesn't have it. And he has to hope he's [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4820.82s)]
*  getting all these donations. Yeah. I mean, yeah. So the system's never going to be perfect, but I'd [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4825.78s)]
*  rather guy run and say, hey, I'm financing myself. I own myself. Than being owned by the corporations. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4831.139999999999s)]
*  And you don't even know who owns them. I mean, it's been suggested that they should, politicians [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4837.46s)]
*  should have to wear those coveralls that they wear in the NASCAR race. Yeah, where you have the logos. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4845.780000000001s)]
*  Are you financing your own campaign? No. So who's in your book? I think Sheryl would still be mad. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4854.42s)]
*  All right. So what? Oh yeah. Here you go. Okay. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4859.62s)]
*  You know, the campaign itself is financed by small donations. The maximum donation is $6,600. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4868.18s)]
*  And those are hard to raise. I'm competing against the White House, the Democratic and [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4878.0199999999995s)]
*  the DNC and the RNC and they can take essentially, I think $250,000 is their minimum. So, [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4885.14s)]
*  you know, I'm at a big disadvantage in fundraising. But there's also a couple of super PACs and the [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4892.34s)]
*  super PACs that support me. I'm not allowed to, you know, coordinate with them, but they've raised [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4901.3s)]
*  a lot of money. I think one of my super PACs has maybe raised 70 million bucks. Can you explain [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4908.5s)]
*  what a super PAC is? What they did is they said, okay, federal, you can't donate directly to a [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4913.78s)]
*  federal political candidate. The maximum for that is $6,600. But you can donate to an entity, which [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4920.98s)]
*  is called a PAC or a super PAC. And you can donate unlimited to them and they can help on the campaign, [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4930.259999999999s)]
*  but they're not allowed to talk to you about how they're going to help. So you can't coordinate [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4938.34s)]
*  with them. What's the justification for that? I guess it's supposed to be a place where [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4942.34s)]
*  it's, I mean, none of it makes sense, but I guess the best justification is that if you're very [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4952.5s)]
*  rich and you want a certain person to win, you ought to be able to promote their candidacy [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4959.22s)]
*  without giving them money. And, you know, I don't know. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4966.34s)]
*  They can buy commercials for you or something. They did. Yeah, they buy. In fact, the Super Bowl [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4972.18s)]
*  commercial was purchased by my super PAC. Oh, wow. So I didn't, you know, Cheryl and I were sitting [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4976.42s)]
*  watching the Super Bowl with my kids. You didn't even know that commercial was going to happen? [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4982.66s)]
*  No. Wow. How bizarre. I heard her let out a yelp. My son said something and I looked up, you know, [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4986.82s)]
*  because it was an ad. So I was looking at my phone. Yeah. And then I heard both of them, [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=4995.86s)]
*  you know, sort of make these surprise shouts and then looked up and saw the ad. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5002.74s)]
*  And now do you have to, you have to live with whatever they say about you, I guess. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5009.62s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, usually the Super PAC is going to say much nicer things about me than, [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5014.66s)]
*  you know, the Democrats and Republicans. Right. Okay. And now that you've run [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5020.26s)]
*  the DNC now has a van that follows me around that has billboards on this. I mean, [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5026.26s)]
*  those moving billboards. Yeah. Yeah. So they. Who's more corrupt? The DNC or the RNC? Yeah. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5030.9800000000005s)]
*  I'd probably equally corrupt, but I don't know. I don't even know how the metric by which you [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5043.3s)]
*  would measure that. Okay. But they're all, I mean, the DNC is really misbehaving. They're [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5050.34s)]
*  really trying to block people. Yeah. They try to block you, right? They try to block me. They try [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5056.26s)]
*  to block Trump and I'm not a fan of Trump's, but I want to be on a level, you know, battlefield with [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5061.78s)]
*  him. I don't want to beat him because a court threw him out. I want to beat him because [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5069.78s)]
*  I'm able to make the argument to the American people that I should be president. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5075.46s)]
*  And I have a debate and that kind of stuff. I don't think it's good for our country. I don't [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5079.38s)]
*  think it's good for the DNC. I think this persecution that the DNC has leveled that people [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5084.900000000001s)]
*  see that as unfair. Americans just viscerally are saying this guy is being attacked and they're, [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5091.62s)]
*  you know, it's moving huge numbers of voters over to him because they're pissed at what the DNC is [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5097.46s)]
*  doing. Yeah. It's also terrible for America. We're supposed to be the exemplary democracy [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5102.42s)]
*  in around the world. This is what they do in, you know, in banana republics. Yeah. You don't want [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5107.54s)]
*  to run against the guy because he's popular. So you get a judge to throw him out. Yeah. It's a [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5112.66s)]
*  great comparison. And you know, it's not, it's not America. And they're, you know, they're doing the [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5117.38s)]
*  same thing to me. They're trying to make sure that nobody can vote for me rather than having [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5123.62s)]
*  President Biden come out and say, here's why I think I should be a good president. Yeah. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5128.26s)]
*  And here's why I think you shouldn't be. And let's have that discussion. Yeah. Not just say, [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5133.62s)]
*  you know, you're not going to let me on the ballot. You're not going to, you're going to [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5139.38s)]
*  disenfranchise Americans so they can't talk to you. Democrats kind of seem from a distance more [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5142.0199999999995s)]
*  crooked is the Republicans didn't seem to want Trump in 2016. They could not stop him in the primary. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5147.62s)]
*  He just fucking destroyed everybody. It seemed like on the flip side with Hillary and with you [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5153.38s)]
*  in 2024, it's like, we don't want this guy, this person to win Bernie in 2016, you in 2024. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5158.1s)]
*  We're just going to have super delegates and then we're going to get our person in there. And that's [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5163.9400000000005s)]
*  what it's going to be. I think that's right. And also the fact that he won't give me secret [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5166.900000000001s)]
*  service protection. You know, that's another kind of weaponization agencies to help help. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5172.58s)]
*  Who is that guy? He's got Tim Cruz's nephew. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5181.860000000001s)]
*  I'm just joking. He's trapped. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5188.34s)]
*  He's making sure you guys don't make a lawn chap. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5198.660000000001s)]
*  You know, I have Gavin De Becker, associates who's, who's giving me protection. That's really, [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5204.820000000001s)]
*  you know, good, but very expensive. So a third one out of every three dollars I raise is [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5212.34s)]
*  going to, you know, to this and it's not, it's not fair. I could be using that. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5218.1s)]
*  You know, I should be able to use that to make the argument. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5223.700000000001s)]
*  Okay. Your last name, Kennedy. One of like the American dynasties, [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5226.660000000001s)]
*  I feel like most Americans, maybe most people around the world very familiar with it. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5233.46s)]
*  What are the benefits and what are also like, not one of the benefits, what are the rules of [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5239.14s)]
*  being a Kennedy? Are there rules? Is there like a culture that you all have to live by? [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5244.1s)]
*  That's a great, is there a way to behave? Like what, what is the, [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5250.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I think we were all raised in a milieu where, you know, we have expectations [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5253.54s)]
*  of each other that you're going to, you know, try to do something good for other people. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5263.38s)]
*  You know, and, you know, many of my cousins, there were 29 cousins, 29 grandchildren of Joe [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5270.02s)]
*  Rose Kennedy. And most of us were raised during the Camelot era. And, you know, I think that really [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5276.82s)]
*  sort of dictated a lot of our worldview and our lives. We all, all I think are raised with this [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5285.14s)]
*  attitude that our lives would be consumed by some great controversy and that it would be a big [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5290.58s)]
*  privilege for us to be able to play a role, an efficacious role in that. You know, I, of course, [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5296.74s)]
*  all, you know, everybody's lives diverge and I've got members of my family now who do not like the [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5307.3s)]
*  fact that I'm running against President Biden. I have five members of my family who work for [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5313.38s)]
*  the administration or closely with the administration. And, you know, President Biden has a bust of my [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5319.7s)]
*  father behind him in the Oval Office. He's been a long-term friend of my family's. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5325.3s)]
*  So I have, there are people in my family who are not excited about that. But, you know, I think [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5330.820000000001s)]
*  generally we all, you know, we were raised arguing with each other. My father would come home [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5335.38s)]
*  in the evenings from the Justice Department and he would set up debates at the dinner table. And [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5342.66s)]
*  we would have to argue a point. My grandfather did that to his nine children. And that, you know, [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5347.62s)]
*  we argue with each other without hating the person, you know, which I think is a good thing [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5354.900000000001s)]
*  for the country to be able to do. One thing I really admire, I'm even listening to you talk, [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5360.82s)]
*  I don't agree with everything you say, but you surround yourself with people who don't agree [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5364.34s)]
*  with that. Cheryl will publicly say she disagrees with you about X, Y and Z. You say on this pod, [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5367.14s)]
*  my kids think I'm a kook sometimes. Like, I really think that is a thing that is missing from the [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5371.46s)]
*  spirit of America right now. And I think it's very cool that you are so open to people disagreeing [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5376.42s)]
*  with you. I mean, I argued about my with my son on Ukraine from the beginning and he just he pushed [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5380.5s)]
*  back on me and then, you know, he put his money where his mouth was and went over there and joined [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5388.74s)]
*  the Foreign Legion and he fought in the car, keep offensive and, you know, I'm lucky that he came [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5393.94s)]
*  back alive. But, you know, he I raised the kids and my grandfather raised his kids. And in fact, [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5400.98s)]
*  my grandfather sent his kids over to London School of Economics to study on a guy under a guy called [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5408.1s)]
*  Harold Lasky, who was regarded as the greatest socialist philosopher at the time. And my [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5418.58s)]
*  grandfather hated him and hated socialism, but he wanted his children to be exposed to different [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5424.42s)]
*  ways of thinking and to be able to do critical thinking themselves. And, you know, they traveled [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5430.9800000000005s)]
*  around Europe, they went to Spain during the Spanish Revolution, they went to Hitler's Germany [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5437.14s)]
*  and they, you know, and he wanted them to be exposed to every kind of thought. And he believed [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5445.22s)]
*  he loved our country because in our country, you're supposed to be done by debate and [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5450.9800000000005s)]
*  the best ideas, the ones that become policy are ideas that have triumphed in the marketplace of [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5457.780000000001s)]
*  ideas and, you know, and they annealed in the furnace of debate. And that's really important [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5462.82s)]
*  for democracy because democracy is actually a very inefficient system. You know, it takes a lot of [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5470.0199999999995s)]
*  effort to get anything done. And so totalitarian systems have a big advantage on us. And the one [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5478.179999999999s)]
*  advantage that we have is that this open ferment of debate, which ultimately gives rise, [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5484.98s)]
*  you know, gives precedence to the ideas that win that contest. And that's supposed, you know, [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5492.82s)]
*  the framers of the Constitution believe that that would put us at an advantage with totalitarian [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5499.54s)]
*  regimes. And it certainly puts us at a business advantage. There's, you know, there's no country [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5504.42s)]
*  like ours. Somebody said to me the other day, what do you see that's happening good in America today? [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5510.18s)]
*  And, you know, it's this entrepreneurial spirit that we have in this country that really does not [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5516.58s)]
*  exist anywhere else in the world that people really believe that they can start a business [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5522.34s)]
*  and have an idea may bring it to fruition. And you don't get that in Europe. Yeah, not at the same [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5528.02s)]
*  level for sure. You can be the best version of yourself here. Yeah, I think a lot of people feel [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5535.62s)]
*  that way. Also, guys, we got to talk about this bad boy. You know what this is? This is an extra [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5540.26s)]

*  RFID protection. You know, all the identity theft, the skimming that happens, you don't even dislike [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5576.02s)]
*  that. They just skim. I don't know the mechanics of it. I think it's like that. Anyway, these offer [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5580.82s)]

*  leverage a hack against you as a presidential candidate. I've heard people say, he's a Kennedy. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5707.46s)]
*  Kennedy's, what do they know about the middle class? What do they know about working hard and [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5712.82s)]
*  being working class people? I'm curious, what would be your rebuttal to that point? [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5716.18s)]
*  My, I would say. What doesn't Kennedy know about the working class? [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5720.9s)]
*  I thought that was... Some people are saying. I mean, you went to jail, then got into Harvard. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5725.62s)]
*  That is a nice move. What? Jail, then Harvard? I'm fairly certain that... [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5733.46s)]
*  No, no, you got kicked out of some boarding schools and then you went to Harvard. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5738.74s)]
*  I went to prison for... I spent the summer of 2001 in an excellent security prison in [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5742.0199999999995s)]
*  Puerto Rico. So I have been to jail. Oh, hell yeah. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5749.22s)]
*  But my father, in his presidential campaign, he did something that everybody thought was impossible, [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5753.7s)]
*  which was to unite white working class Americans and middle class Americans with the poor, [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5766.1s)]
*  with people of color, with American Indians, with Cesar Chavez and with urban blacks. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5774.34s)]
*  When I was a kid, my father would take us whenever we traveled anywhere. He'd always take us to an [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5785.0599999999995s)]
*  Indian reservation nearby. When we went to Appalachia, he'd take us to a place where there [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5791.78s)]
*  was a lot of poverty. On weekends, he'd take us a drive through southeast Washington and he would [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5798.02s)]
*  say to us, these are our people. These are Kennedy people. The wealthy people in this country, they [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5806.18s)]
*  don't need a politician or a lawyer or anything else. They don't need the Kennedys. They already [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5818.02s)]
*  have the system rigged. He said, these are your people. My father would come back. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5823.62s)]
*  He came back one time from Mississippi and we were all sitting at dinner and he came back and [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5831.54s)]
*  he said to us, today I saw a family, a visit family, who was... There were two families living [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5836.98s)]
*  in a house smaller than this dining room and they were... The children have only one meal a day. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5844.34s)]
*  And he said, when you get older, I want you to help those people. And so that was kind of a message [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5853.3s)]
*  that was part of, I think, all of our growing up. There's an expectation of benevolence. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5860.5s)]
*  You're going to help somebody who's less fortunate. My aunt, Una Shriver, founded Special Olympics. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5864.66s)]
*  Her son, Anthony Shriver, who's very a strong supporter of my campaign, is running my campaign [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5872.18s)]
*  in Florida, was the founder of Best Bodies, which helps people with intellectual disabilities, [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5878.18s)]
*  to unite them with college kids. Another of his brothers runs UNICEF. Another of his brothers [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5882.9800000000005s)]
*  run Save the Children. And you go through my family and most of them are doing things like that, [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5890.1s)]
*  or they're doing things to stand up for the most vulnerable, the alienated, dispossessed people in [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5898.02s)]
*  this society and bring them into the American experience. That's awesome. And they keep trying [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5904.5s)]
*  to kill you guys. What the fuck is this about? Well, that's a question I have. You firmly believe [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5911.06s)]
*  the CIA killed your uncle, killed your father, and... Well, I was saying, my father, the abundance [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5916.98s)]
*  of evidence of my uncle's death, the CIA was involved, I think it was beyond any dispute. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5924.42s)]
*  If I were a prosecutor, I feel I could win that case without doing any further discoveries, [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5930.26s)]
*  because with my father, I always assumed that Sir Anne killed my father. Sir Anne confessed to the [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5937.22s)]
*  crime, confessed to killing him. There were 77 eyewitnesses in the room. And so I didn't think [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5944.02s)]
*  there was any question. And then a guy called Paul Schrade, who is one of my father's close friends, [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5952.66s)]
*  he was a deputy director of the United Auto Workers. He had brought, recruited St. Sarkozy [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5957.38s)]
*  into the labor movement. He was standing next to my father the night that my father was killed. And [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5963.9400000000005s)]
*  he took the first bullet. So he got shot in the head by Sir Anne. Sir Anne was waiting at a steam [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5968.66s)]
*  table. And my father was brought through the kitchen where he was not scheduled to go. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5977.3s)]
*  And Sir Anne fired two shots at my father. The first one he hit Paul Schrade in the head, [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5982.42s)]
*  the second one he hit a door jam behind my father, the wooden frame of the door. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5988.259999999999s)]
*  The LAPD later took it out of that, you know, removed it. Then he was grabbed by six men, [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=5993.94s)]
*  including Rayford Johnson, who was the 1960 decathlon champion, one of my father's best friends, [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6001.139999999999s)]
*  Rosie Greer, who was part of the fearsome foursome. And three other guys or four other guys, [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6008.42s)]
*  they pinned them against the same table and they took his gun hand and they put it, pushed it away [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6019.06s)]
*  from my father pointing the opposite way. But Rayford Johnson later told me he was trying to pry the [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6025.86s)]
*  gun out of Sir Anne's hands. Sir Anne's this little guy when I met him in prison, the first [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6033.46s)]
*  thing that impressed me is how tiny and frail he looked. But Rayford Johnson said that he had superhuman [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6039.14s)]
*  strength. And he then fired off six more shots and emptied the chamber, but exactly the opposite [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6045.7s)]
*  direction of my father. And all of those shots hit people. So we know what happened to every bullet [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6053.7s)]
*  in his gun. He was always in front of my father and never got behind him. But the bullets that [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6059.06s)]
*  killed my father, according to Thomas Noguchi's autopsy report, Thomas Noguchi was the most [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6066.660000000001s)]
*  important coroner in American history. And my father's autopsy is called the perfect autopsy. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6071.700000000001s)]
*  Because Noguchi knew that what had happened in Dallas with my uncle with the autopsy was [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6077.54s)]
*  completely botched. And so he wanted to make sure nobody, you know, to avoid all that criticism. So [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6082.5s)]
*  he flew in the chief coroner of all the armed service, every branch of the armed service, [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6089.14s)]
*  and a lot of other famous coroners, and they all sat in the theater and watched him perform the [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6094.74s)]
*  autopsy. And what his autopsy found is my father was shot four times from behind, never from in front. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6099.38s)]
*  And the shots, one of the shots passed harmlessly through his shoulder pad, the other three, two [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6106.18s)]
*  lodged in his back, the other one was right behind his ear. And that in each case, [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6112.42s)]
*  they were contact shots, meaning the barrel of the gun was touching his skin or half an inch from it, [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6119.3s)]
*  and they left carbon tattoos. And they all had an upward angle, so that whoever was doing it was [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6125.3s)]
*  standing behind my father and holding the gun, not directly at him like that, but at an angle [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6134.58s)]
*  where you could keep him closer. So it was almost like the guy who was in that position is a guy [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6141.46s)]
*  called Eugene Thane Cesar, and he was a security guard who was hired two days before when my father's [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6147.7s)]
*  schedule was already known. So now he's walking through his kitchen, which he shouldn't be walking [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6156.1s)]
*  through. He's got this security guy. He grabbed the security guard, is the guy who steered him [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6159.78s)]
*  into the ambush. That's what I'm saying. He had my father's elbow and he was directing him. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6165.219999999999s)]
*  And then, you know, Zerhan starts firing. My father then falls back and he lands on Cesar. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6173.0599999999995s)]
*  Cesar and- Wait, Eugene is, what's his last name? Eugene Thane Cesar. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6180.82s)]
*  Thane. And my father must have known he was being shot from behind because [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6186.1s)]
*  the last thing he did is rotate and turn and pull off the clip-on tie that Cesar had on. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6193.46s)]
*  Get the fuck out. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6200.26s)]
*  You see the original early pictures before my mother took that out and put a rosary in his hand. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6201.22s)]
*  But he originally, he has that tie in his hand and there's pictures of Cesar from that night that [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6207.860000000001s)]
*  don't have a tie on. Cesar was seen by all the eyewitnesses with his gun drawn. When he pushed [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6214.0199999999995s)]
*  my father off, he had his gun drawn. He was asked by the police, why did you have your gun drawn? [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6224.179999999999s)]
*  He said, I was shooting at Zerhan. But there's no evidence of that. And then he was caught [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6230.74s)]
*  in multiple, multiple lies about what he did with the gun. The police did not take the gun [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6238.42s)]
*  from him that night. There was a gun that was fired at the scene and the police did not take it. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6243.7s)]
*  The police also destroyed all the photos before trial. They collected every photo, [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6253.38s)]
*  taken that room, 2,200 photos and destroyed them all. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6257.62s)]
*  Who hired Eugene? He was hired by a company called A-Security, [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6261.38s)]
*  but he had a real job. His real job was at the Boeing plant and he had high security clearance. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6267.38s)]
*  He was allowed in the top secret parts of the plant. Before that, he had worked for Hughes [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6275.46s)]
*  engineering, which Howard Hughes was very much, you know, the people, Robert Mayhew, [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6280.82s)]
*  who is his deputy, was deeply involved in the Kennedy and the JFK assassination. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6288.1s)]
*  Now here's what happens next. A guy shows up as Eugene, as Zerhan's lawyer. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6293.7s)]
*  It's an attorney who is at that point involved in the Friars Club case. Do you know what the [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6302.98s)]
*  Friars Club is? It's a club. Well, I know the Friars Club in New York, but I know the case. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6310.179999999999s)]
*  The original one is in LA and it was famous because the Rat Pack, Joey Bishop, Frank Sartre, [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6314.98s)]
*  all of those guys, Sammy Davis, Dean Martin were all members. It was run by Mickey Collins, [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6322.26s)]
*  who's the mafia chief and Johnny Rizzelli, who was the Cuba guy. He was the liaison. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6330.26s)]
*  We need the red string. They have a lawyer in the art. Their lawyer, Mickey Collins' lawyer, [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6343.14s)]
*  is shows. Mickey Collins is Alcatraz, right? He's the guy. He's the mafia boss in LA. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6351.860000000001s)]
*  The lawyer has been indicted because in the Friars Club, it turns out that the mafia had secret [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6365.14s)]
*  recording. They had cameras on the roof of the Friars Club and they were looking at everybody's [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6376.74s)]
*  cards and fixing the games. It's a famous trial that took many weeks. In that trial, it comes out [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6384.099999999999s)]
*  that the defense, the mob lawyers, had obtained the grand jury testimony, which is completely [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6393.7s)]
*  you go to jail for a long time for that. This attorney was charged with that. He's under a lot [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6401.7s)]
*  of stress. He's trying the case for the mafia that he doesn't want to lose. He's charged with [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6408.5s)]
*  stealing the grand jury testimony and he somehow finds time to show up and represent Sirhan. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6415.62s)]
*  So he goes, so he's Sirhan's lawyer. He tells Sirhan, you gotta plead guilty and then he buries [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6423.3s)]
*  all of the forensic evidence, all the ballistic evidence, which if there's no way Sirhan could [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6433.14s)]
*  have been convicted because the gun, the bullets that are in my father did not match the bullets [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6439.54s)]
*  that were in other people. They didn't come from the same gun. Also 13 shots fired, Sirhan's gun [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6446.1s)]
*  only holds eight. Exactly. So we know that there is not like he's reloading. There's recording. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6449.94s)]
*  There's audios of it, you know, of the 13 shots. Wow. So this anyway, it's a lot of circumstantial [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6454.74s)]
*  evidence. It's not the kind of evidence that we think that that's solid. It is circumstantial. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6461.62s)]
*  With your uncle, you think it's not circumstantial. It's just black and white, but with my father, [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6466.339999999999s)]
*  it's circumstantial. So you cannot definitively say, but you can say there's a lot of, you know, [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6470.9s)]
*  Why is it so black and white with you? I hate to move on. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6477.54s)]
*  It would take me three days to go through the evidence, you know, to even give you a [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6482.0199999999995s)]
*  tip of the iceberg. People who are genuinely curious about my uncle's assassination, the CIA [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6486.5s)]
*  involvement should read a book. There are many books, but I think the best one is a book called [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6493.94s)]
*  The Unspeakable by Jim Douglas. And what he's done is he's taken this mountain of evidence and [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6498.42s)]
*  he's distilled it all and it's riveting. It's very, very easy to read and it's really fascinating. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6505.38s)]
*  And I think it's impossible to read that book and come away without [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6511.86s)]
*  thinking that the CIA killed JFK. Okay. Is it possible that any kind of mind altering [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6517.86s)]
*  experiments or substances were used in both cases? Like you've heard of MK Ultra. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6525.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh, yeah. MK, that's interesting that you say that because. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6530.339999999999s)]
*  Because didn't Sirhan say that he didn't have any recollections? [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6534.419999999999s)]
*  He believes that he was hypnotized. And the defense, even the San Quentin psychiatrist, [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6537.379999999999s)]
*  defense and prosecution scientist, also, it was hypnotized. And I'm not arguing this because [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6548.98s)]
*  I really don't know. I'm just saying that there's a lot of fishy stuff about this, but [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6555.54s)]
*  there's a guy called Dan Martin who teaches at Harvard Medical School. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6561.14s)]
*  Got him. You got it. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6566.58s)]
*  And he is the world's expert on hypnosis. And he's been in to hypnotize Sirhan many, many, [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6570.1s)]
*  many times. And he said that I've talked to him. He said there's four classes of people in hypnosis. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6581.14s)]
*  I think it's number one is the people who simply cannot be hypnotized. And then four [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6591.3s)]
*  is people who are the easiest hypnotized. And he told me this, he said Sirhan's like 4.9. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6599.46s)]
*  And he said that when he goes into Sirhan, he takes out a coin and shows it to Sirhan. And [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6606.82s)]
*  Sirhan immediately goes out. And he said his head flips back and snot starts pouring out of his nose. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6620.42s)]
*  So his eyes roll up. And then he gives them a possum knot, a suggestion. And they [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6628.74s)]
*  suggest, for example, he'll say to him, after I wake you up, if I ever show you a handkerchief, [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6636.099999999999s)]
*  I want you to climb on the roof of the cell. Then he'll wake him up and he'll wait a while. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6644.259999999999s)]
*  And he'll fool with the handkerchief. And Sirhan will start climbing on the cell. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6654.82s)]
*  But he said if you ask Sirhan, why are you doing that? He said, I just needed the exercise. He'll [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6661.94s)]
*  deny that he's been hypnotized. So again, this gets really deep into sort of conspiracy. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6667.139999999999s)]
*  I am not arguing that this happened. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6674.179999999999s)]
*  You're saying these things are also true. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6676.339999999999s)]
*  You're saying these things are also true. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6678.74s)]
*  These are true and you can make of them what you will. And there's a lot of other [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6680.419999999999s)]
*  really interesting parts to this story that are fishy. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6686.820000000001s)]
*  And it's not circumstantial to you. It's black and white. I could prove this in a court of [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6694.02s)]
*  law if given the opportunity. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6697.14s)]
*  Well, Sirhan, no. Sirhan is totally, to me, it's all circumstantial. There's no confessions, [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6698.34s)]
*  none of that. But with my uncle, I think it's black and white. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6705.22s)]
*  Are you scared at all? [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6712.34s)]
*  That's my question. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6713.700000000001s)]
*  Do you get into power that this same circumstance will happen to you? [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6714.34s)]
*  Well, I'm not scared, but I'm also not stupid about it. I know that what I'm doing is [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6719.9400000000005s)]
*  challenging trillions of dollars of financial interest and power interest. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6728.5s)]
*  And the CIA specifically, which- [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6734.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, the CIA, other interests too. Oh, I know. And so I'm not stupid. I take precautions. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6738.18s)]
*  I do things that I don't want to do. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6747.14s)]
*  Like, for example? [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6752.18s)]
*  Well, I don't like a guy following me when I go to the bathroom. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6753.780000000001s)]
*  And I want to get out. And if there's people in a supermarket, [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6758.900000000001s)]
*  I have these arguments with my team all the time. I said, oh, I wanted to go out. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6765.14s)]
*  They had this big van. I gave a speech down in Bed-Stuy this week, two days ago. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6771.3s)]
*  And there was a van outside that the DNC is paying to that has slanders about me [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6776.66s)]
*  running in lights. It's one of those moving billboards that is constantly changing. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6786.66s)]
*  I want to go outside and talk to the driver and also get my picture taken in front of the van. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6792.02s)]
*  And they say no to that? [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6801.14s)]
*  My security team wouldn't let me do that. There are certain things they say you can't do that. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6802.820000000001s)]
*  And I got to do what they tell me to do because otherwise they'll pull it. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6807.38s)]
*  Do they charge you extra because you're like a high risk? [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6812.34s)]
*  No. Gavin Becker would give it to me for free. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6815.22s)]
*  Right. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6819.46s)]
*  He loves me. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6820.18s)]
*  But I'm saying the security guys. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6822.74s)]
*  He's very supportive and he runs the company. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6824.1s)]
*  He can't because I can't take anything for free. So I have to pay the full fare. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6827.7s)]
*  So that's what I'm doing. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6832.34s)]
*  Nobody can give it to me for free. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6834.34s)]
*  What happened to this guy, Eugene, the security guard? [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6836.58s)]
*  It's interesting. He went to and the whole story is fascinating because actually Serhan [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6839.46s)]
*  and worked at a track that apparently was, I think it was in the name of Dina DeLorenes, [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6845.62s)]
*  but the true owner was Mickey Cohen and he worked at a horse track. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6854.26s)]
*  And at that horse track, they were the stable boys and the walker. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6859.22s)]
*  He was a walker. He'd never been on a horse before. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6865.38s)]
*  And the trainers were all experimenting with hypnosis on their lunch breaks, [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6869.22s)]
*  their different breaks. So they were all hypnotizing each other. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6874.419999999999s)]
*  And who knows what happened. Maybe it was a screening issue there. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6881.7s)]
*  But I'll just tell you one other interesting fact. You mentioned MKUltra. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6887.299999999999s)]
*  One of the hospitals that apparently used MKUltra was, I think it was a naval base. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6893.219999999999s)]
*  There was naval infirmary in Pasadena. Serhan, one day they said, [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6900.82s)]
*  Serhan, we want you to get on the horse. He'd never been on any horse and they were [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6905.86s)]
*  going to put him on a thoroughbred and have him racing around a quarter mile track. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6910.179999999999s)]
*  Obviously he falls off. He hits his head on the rail. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6914.82s)]
*  He's brought to the Pasadena hospital. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6918.82s)]
*  Let the fuck out of here. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6921.46s)]
*  And his memory is that he stayed in that hospital for three months. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6922.82s)]
*  And when his appeals attorney went to the hospital and got his records, [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6927.94s)]
*  it said he had four stitches and was discharged in an hour. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6934.66s)]
*  And he has very vivid memories of what took place in this hospital. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6939.54s)]
*  He said there were other people from the track who were also there that had bandages on their heads. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6944.1s)]
*  Again, this is stuff he says. I'm not assigning any credibility to it. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6949.78s)]
*  It's part of this. It's part of this. A lot of the questions I would like to ask people [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6956.099999999999s)]
*  that were never asked of people. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6964.5s)]
*  There's a lot of women that complain about gaslighting from their boyfriends. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6966.82s)]
*  Nobody has been gaslit more than the Kennedy family. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6971.139999999999s)]
*  How do you stay sane? There is one narrative that is constantly being pushed out in media, [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6974.74s)]
*  and film, and television. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6981.46s)]
*  And then there's another completely plausible narrative that you and your family are investigating. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6983.78s)]
*  My family's not investigating. My family does not want anything to do with this. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6990.58s)]
*  They just accept it? [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6994.26s)]
*  It was so shattering to my siblings and to my... [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=6996.9s)]
*  You're not around when we were kids, but for maybe 20 years, the Zabruder films were played [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7001.94s)]
*  as a loop. When those came on in my household, the TVs were turned off. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7011.620000000001s)]
*  Everybody was so devastated by this. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7019.860000000001s)]
*  Nobody's bringing... Nothing you do is going to bring my father back. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7024.660000000001s)]
*  Nothing is going to bring my uncle back. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7028.1s)]
*  My father, the first day when my uncle was killed, I came home from school. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7029.700000000001s)]
*  My mother picked us up early, and my father was walking in the yard with John McComb, [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7036.26s)]
*  who was the head of the CIA. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7041.46s)]
*  And he was the first person to get over there because the CIA is only half a mile from my house. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7044.02s)]
*  And McComb used to come there every afternoon and swim in the pool. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7049.14s)]
*  But that as soon as... The first thing they did, my dad did when he learned that his brother, [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7052.18s)]
*  when Jay had gone over to Alton, his brother was shot on the telephone as he called up [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7059.06s)]
*  the CIA and said, the desk officer, and said, did your people do this? [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7065.86s)]
*  Wow. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7071.379999999999s)]
*  He asked the same question to John McComb. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7072.9s)]
*  John McComb had been... My uncle had fired Alan Dulles and Richard Bissell and Charles [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7076.42s)]
*  Cabell, the guys who had orchestrated the Bay of Pigs because they lied to him. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7081.219999999999s)]
*  And he said, I want to take the CIA and shatter it into a thousand pieces and scatter it to the [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7085.379999999999s)]
*  winds. He fired them and they brought in... My uncle originally wanted my father to run the CIA [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7089.7s)]
*  because he thought it's such a mess and only Bobby can fix it. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7096.74s)]
*  My grandfather had stepped in and said, you can't do that. You can't have your brother running the [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7102.74s)]
*  spy agency. It's like Stalin and Molotov. You can't have the brother of a president. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7108.0199999999995s)]
*  It's too close. The American people want it. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7112.74s)]
*  It's just terrible optics for the whole world. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7114.74s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Smart. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7117.38s)]
*  Smart. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7118.02s)]
*  They brought in John McComb, who was like a Republican business guy, very pious Catholic, [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7118.660000000001s)]
*  and he ran it, but nobody ever told him anything. So the whole bureaucracy that's under... [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7125.22s)]
*  He doesn't know what's going on. And then my father then called one of the Cuban [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7134.18s)]
*  pig leaders, a guy called Harry Ruiz, who is very close to my family. I was in a hotel room [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7140.42s)]
*  in Washington, D.C. with a famous writer who wrote the book on the Bay of Pigs. And my father [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7145.22s)]
*  said to him, did your guys do this? So that was his first instinct. And then he then [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7153.62s)]
*  didn't talk about it until a week before his election. He refused to talk about it. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7160.740000000001s)]
*  But you would ask about... And my family is still that way. They're still in shock. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7166.42s)]
*  They're still... BTSD and my family, from what I hear. We're all there watching my dad die. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7171.78s)]
*  A bunch of us kids were there watching me in Los Angeles that night. I was with my dad when he died. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7178.26s)]
*  And it's too much, and they don't want to go into it. So you ask about Eugene Tencésar. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7187.7s)]
*  I got in contact with him. And this was like three years ago. And I said, will you talk to me? [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7199.06s)]
*  He's in the Philippines. And he said that through an intermediary, he said that he would. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7207.860000000001s)]
*  But I had to pay him $10,000. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7219.38s)]
*  Motherfucker. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7221.22s)]
*  I said, okay, I'll do that. And I want to interview you on video. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7222.5s)]
*  And he said for $10,000. And I was getting ready to leave. And they told me now it's $15,000. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7229.7s)]
*  And then basically the day before I was going to the airport, he said, no, it's $25,000. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7239.06s)]
*  So then I said, okay, this is... [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7244.26s)]
*  A setup. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7245.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7246.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. He didn't want to string you along. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7247.7s)]
*  Yeah. Then he died about a year ago. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7249.46s)]
*  Of? [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7253.7s)]
*  Who knows? It's very hard to find out. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7255.46s)]
*  At the time of Brian McKenna? [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7257.3s)]
*  Because he's in the Philippines. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7258.34s)]
*  Wow. And he fled to the Philippines immediately after? [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7259.86s)]
*  Not immediately. He's kind of got an interesting background besides [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7263.94s)]
*  having this high intelligence classification at a series of top military contractors. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7271.62s)]
*  And those military contractors, a lot of people who work for them are CIA. So you have to sign... [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7278.18s)]
*  They're either CIA assets or agents. You have to sign... In order to work there, [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7285.780000000001s)]
*  in order to get the classification, you have to sign a state secrecy agreement, [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7290.66s)]
*  which makes you basically a lifetime CIA asset. And he identified himself. There's a writer [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7295.14s)]
*  called Lisa Pease who really did a deep dive into him. And at one point he identified himself [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7303.06s)]
*  as a CIA agent, and that's in her book. And so he also was extremely right wing. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7308.740000000001s)]
*  And independent of any intelligence connections that he had, he hated my father because he thought [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7322.580000000001s)]
*  if my father was elected president, he was going to put the blacks in charge of our country. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7331.94s)]
*  Was that his plan? [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7337.54s)]
*  That was. I could finally come clean about that. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7339.139999999999s)]
*  I do. I like that guy. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7344.66s)]
*  It's just remarkable, man. It's just... Yeah. I mean, it's a lot to digest. We need to have the [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7355.46s)]
*  three day deep dive for your uncle. Well, you read that book. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7364.42s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to check it out. That's a really good book. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7368.099999999999s)]
*  And then the other one by Talbot, you said? By David Talbot. David Talbot wrote two fantastic [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7370.02s)]
*  books. One about my father and uncle and the CIA. But the one that you should read is Devil's [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7374.900000000001s)]
*  Chessboard, at least first. And that is about just this biography of Dulles. And if you want [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7382.1s)]
*  to talk about a supervillain like Luther, that's the guy. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7388.9s)]
*  When you met with Sirhan in prison, this is the man that allegedly killed your father. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7400.74s)]
*  That's what the record says. Oh, he was definitely involved in the ambush. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7406.9s)]
*  Did you feel he was guilty when you met him? Did you feel like he was remorseful? What did [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7410.9s)]
*  you feel like his energy was? Well, first of all, he's a very gentle soul. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7414.58s)]
*  He was very humble and he cried. And he also said, he cried and he held both my hands and [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7421.38s)]
*  put my hands to his forehead and said, thank you. Thank you for coming here. Every time I saw your [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7433.94s)]
*  mom on TV with all of you guys, it would make me cry. So, it was an interesting conversation. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7439.7s)]
*  He had a fascination. He came from Palestine. Incidentally, when the Merm, my dad was killed, [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7452.9800000000005s)]
*  he was facing the death penalty. And my family all signed a letter to Judge Walker saying, [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7465.14s)]
*  please don't give him the death penalty. And then I think three years later, my brother Joe was [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7471.54s)]
*  hijacked. He was on a plane coming back from Pakistan and Palestinians, Black September group, [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7477.700000000001s)]
*  hijacked the plane. And they tried to land in Amman and Jordan and the [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7488.42s)]
*  King Hussein wouldn't let them. And so then they landed in the desert in Yemen and they demanded [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7498.74s)]
*  the release of Sarayan initially. And then they blew up the plane and burned it. But they [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7506.34s)]
*  ultimately released my brother. But I feel like [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7514.98s)]
*  people deserve justice no matter who they are. And Sarayan, I'm curious about what happened with my [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7527.0599999999995s)]
*  dad. And Sarayan was just, it was interesting. It was very, very interesting. He came over here as [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7538.18s)]
*  a refugee and really had nothing. But he loved horses from when he was little. He never was on [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7546.900000000001s)]
*  a horse. The only time he was on a horse was that time they put him on a horse. But he became a [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7554.18s)]
*  horse walker at this track. But you weren't mad because you know he was involved in the plot. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7558.1s)]
*  I try to forgive people. And you know Sarayan for a couple of reasons. Sarayan was in jail for 60 [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7568.18s)]
*  years. I don't think anger or resentments are a good thing. I think that they're corrosive to [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7583.06s)]
*  your soul. And I think having anger or resentment, carrying that around against another human being [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7591.0599999999995s)]
*  is like swallowing poison and hoping someone else will die. And you're letting other people [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7598.98s)]
*  live in your head rent free and you're giving them power over your life. So the best way to escape [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7605.86s)]
*  from that kind of corrosive force is to pray for people and forgive them. And so I don't, [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7611.94s)]
*  yeah, I don't carry resentments or anger toward him. But also I don't believe that his bullets [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7618.099999999999s)]
*  killed my dad. And I think if my dad were around, my dad really, you know the arc of all his whole [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7627.94s)]
*  career was toward justice. And you know there's a little brown guy in jail who didn't get a proper [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7636.82s)]
*  trial for 60 years. And I think my father would at least, you know, would not like that. Oh wow. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7645.46s)]
*  Best book on your granddad? [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7653.86s)]
*  Well, I think the book I wrote, which is American Values, is the best thing to read about my grandpa. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7658.58s)]
*  And there's a chapter on him in there that answers a lot of these questions. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7665.22s)]
*  And it's easier, it's easy to read. And it's the first chapter in the book. The major work [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7670.26s)]
*  that's been done on my grandfather that is, you know, kind of the definitive, if you want to read [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7679.3s)]
*  a big research, it's called The Patriarch. Yeah, I have, yeah. And do you think that, [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7684.900000000001s)]
*  sorry, do you think it's a fair take on him or do you think that? I think it's pretty fair. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7693.06s)]
*  I don't like it completely, but it does exonerate him from being a bootlegger. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7697.78s)]
*  Got you, okay. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7701.46s)]
*  No, it doesn't, he didn't know, what's his name, David, the guy who wrote the book. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7702.9800000000005s)]
*  He's written a few of these. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7709.3s)]
*  He was not, I think he missed a big part of the story because he was not aware of [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7712.74s)]
*  the bad feelings between my family and the CIA. He knew the incidences, but he didn't know what [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7721.46s)]
*  was happening in the agency. Yeah. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7730.580000000001s)]
*  Wow. So through everything that you've been through, all the trauma that you face as a kid [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7732.660000000001s)]
*  experiencing all these horrible events, you still have a desire to serve the American people and [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7737.3s)]
*  to wake up every day, whether it's through environmentalism, whether it's through politics. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7742.34s)]
*  Do you ever get the feeling of just giving up? Do you ever just say, you know what? [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7746.42s)]
*  I don't. I'm not dealing with this. What all these people say, I'm smeared by the media, [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7749.78s)]
*  just go to hell with all of them. Do you ever feel that? [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7754.099999999999s)]
*  No, I don't because what are we here for? I mean, it's not just to make a big pile for ourselves [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7756.34s)]
*  and whoever dies with the most stuff wins. There's got to be a reason, I think anything that is [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7764.82s)]
*  worthwhile is you have to struggle for it. I mean, I look back, I read a lot of history and [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7775.139999999999s)]
*  everybody that I've admired throughout human history, whether it's Alexander the Great to [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7783.0599999999995s)]
*  Magellan, they've all been through a struggle where they were disavowed by everybody that they knew [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7789.78s)]
*  and where they had to kind of walk through a valley of death where they were completely alone. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7798.9s)]
*  That is one of the things that made their lives worthwhile. All the incoming flak that I get, [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7803.62s)]
*  I try to look at that as a gift and say, the harder this is, the more important it is. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7810.98s)]
*  If you look at it that way, you can change your attitude towards it. You don't ever feel [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7818.42s)]
*  oppressed by it. I think that's the most paralyzing thing that really disables a lot of people is a [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7825.54s)]
*  sense of victimization and self-pity. I got sober 40 years ago, but at one point I said, [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7833.62s)]
*  I heard myself complaining about something and I thought that's kind of a natural reaction [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7847.62s)]
*  for me that if somebody asks me how you doing, that I'll share some bad thing that happened to [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7854.74s)]
*  me recently or something. So I said, I'm going to experiment with just not complaining about [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7861.3s)]
*  anything for Lent. And it was right at the beginning of Ash Wednesday. I went for 40 days [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7867.94s)]
*  and I just didn't complain. So if somebody asks me how you doing, I always say great. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7874.42s)]
*  And then what I would do, because I don't want to lie, I'd say, well, why am I feeling great? [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7878.98s)]
*  I'm feeling great because I'm an American at a time in history when most of the people in this [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7883.7s)]
*  country live like gods compared to everybody other person in history. I live at a time when [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7888.98s)]
*  there's antibiotics. I'd be dead if it weren't for antibiotics. I can get orange juice whenever I [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7895.46s)]
*  want it. There's glass in front of me when I drive so the bugs don't come in my eyes. And I think of [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7901.7s)]
*  all these little things that, okay, I'm grateful for it. And I make that list and I feel differently [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7909.7s)]
*  about life. I'm processing life differently, processing experience differently in a way that [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7915.54s)]
*  lifts my mood and makes me feel grateful. Gratitude ultimately is a choice. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7922.66s)]
*  So at the end of 40 days, I just said, this is really working for me. And so since then, [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7928.179999999999s)]
*  I've never complained about anything in my life, nothing. And I have my son Connor, when I was [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7934.02s)]
*  about when he was, I don't know, he was like 14 years old. And he said to me, Hey, dad, [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7943.620000000001s)]
*  how come I've never heard you complain about anything? And I said to him, it's actually not [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7950.18s)]
*  a natal impulse for me. My, you know, my atavistic impulses complain about all this stuff. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7956.18s)]
*  And I told him the story that I, you know, that I just made a decision and that it really worked [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7961.86s)]
*  out for me. And after that, I never heard him complain in his whole life. And he's went through [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7967.78s)]
*  a lot of like nightmare stuff. And but everybody loves him, because he just has a buoyant attitude [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7973.54s)]
*  and never complains about anything. So I think it's I recommend it. I think it's a really good way to [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7982.259999999999s)]
*  live your life and to forgive people who, you know, who wrong you. And I've had people do things [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7991.06s)]
*  where I could walk around with justified anger. If I have things that I could justify if I wanted [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=7997.9400000000005s)]
*  to be if I let myself be angry. You're giving other people control of your mind and, you know, [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=8004.58s)]
*  over your over your day. And [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=8012.900000000001s)]
*  and so when it comes to complaints, it's about personal situations. Like obviously you have [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=8015.3s)]
*  gripes with the American system and you have the gripes with government and you feel comfortable [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=8021.3s)]
*  pushing back against those things. Yeah, I'm going to criticize if I say something wrong. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=8025.46s)]
*  Yeah. I'm not going to say look what they're doing to me. You know, they're treating me. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=8029.780000000001s)]
*  I'm not about you. It's about yourself. Yeah. Listen, we've been informed that you have a busy [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=8034.18s)]
*  day. Obviously you're running for president. You got other things to do and hang out with us and [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=8039.860000000001s)]
*  tell us awesome stories. But I just want to say thank you so much for coming on the show. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=8042.9s)]
*  It's been absolutely amazing. Thank you guys. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=8046.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah, just really cool. Just great to hear your perspective on all these things. And it's great [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=8049.299999999999s)]
*  to hear. Yeah, I wish you the best of luck, man. I really do wish you the best of luck. It's cool. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=8053.46s)]
*  This is really awesome. Yeah, I don't know what's going to happen in this election. You know, [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=8058.099999999999s)]
*  I don't even know if Biden's running. I don't know what's going on. Genuinely, the two people, [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=8061.78s)]
*  you have Trump and you have Biden, right? I don't know if Biden makes it to the election. And I [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=8066.339999999999s)]
*  don't know if they'll allow Trump to do it. So you might be president by default. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=8070.66s)]
*  That's a very real issue with you. I wish you were like 95 years old. Yeah. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=8074.98s)]
*  That's kind of what I look for in a president. A hundred years old. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=8080.26s)]
*  Anyway, so please tell them, I know that they can go to kennedy24.com if they want to support [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=8083.3s)]

*  I agree. I'm going to put my signature on there today. Yeah. Thank you. When are you dropping [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=8108.42s)]

*  Kennedy boat shoe would be flames. Yeah. Top cider, dude. Let's go. I need to get on that. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=8116.82s)]
*  Guys, thank you so much, man. That's our RMP. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikcyVzWSyU&t=8124.74s)]
