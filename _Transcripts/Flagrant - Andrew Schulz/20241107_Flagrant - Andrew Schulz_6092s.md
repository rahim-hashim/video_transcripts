*  Delph comes somewhere, he's not welcome, and won't leave. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=55.68s)]
*  It did! They get kicked out. It's 110. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=57.68s)]
*  We call you the little hats and you're wearing the biggest hat possible. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=60.0s)]
*  Why are you doing that? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=62.400000000000006s)]

*  You not wearing your son Yamaka, bro? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=67.60000000000001s)]

*  Oh, yeah. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=72.56s)]
*  Okay, okay. But in all seriousness, guys, let's have a real conversation. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=73.12s)]
*  Alex, what are you feeling? What's going on in your mind? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=76.64s)]
*  How are you dealing with the information? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=81.28s)]
*  It's a great day. I woke up to racist text messages and DMs and stuff. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  A lot of S's in that word for you, man. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it was. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=90.0s)]
*  What'd they say? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  And text—who raises text messages? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=91.68s)]
*  Yeah! That's bold. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=93.68s)]
*  Just DMs, just DMs. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, come on. Text messages create the victim ideology. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=95.84s)]
*  Right? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=99.76s)]
*  No, but my group chat of all black guys, they gotta hit me with racist shit. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=100.72s)]
*  So they happy, bro. They're happy. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=104.08000000000001s)]
*  Oh, they are. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=105.84s)]
*  Come on. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=106.72s)]
*  My friend Tobago. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=107.28s)]
*  I shouldn't have gone to you first. I knew you were gonna bring down the mood. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=108.4s)]
*  Mark, what's your mom's thing? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=111.6s)]
*  Tell me what the family celebration was like. What was the group chat doing? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=113.2s)]
*  Group chats divided. Group chats divided. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=116.24s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=118.24s)]
*  Some people were like, hell yeah, Trump's president, let's fucking go. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=118.64s)]
*  The other half is like the corporations have taken over and Satan is now in charge. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=121.36s)]
*  Because ultimately all politicians serve Satan. Okay? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=125.2s)]
*  So there's no political discourse about Satan. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  Yo, Mark's mom is the shit. We should have her on today. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  That would have been the best. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=132.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=134.0s)]
*  And just watch her just laser beam dove for two hours on the podcast. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=134.32s)]
*  Stalk straight into his soul. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  You guys knew who was gonna win? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=140.72s)]
*  Double would convert. Double would absolutely convert. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=141.6s)]
*  Okay. What are you feeling, Akash? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=144.24s)]
*  Yo, I kind of smugly satisfied. Like this is what y'all get. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=146.0s)]
*  Y'all didn't want to come on flagrant. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=149.84s)]
*  You know what they told us? It was too big of a risk. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=151.28s)]
*  It was too big of a risk for Kamala to come on. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  Okay. You fucking loser. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=155.84s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like, you know, it's a kind of a risk and not doing any big podcasts. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=157.84s)]
*  Bro, you know what? We told a little Chinese man once. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=162.0s)]
*  He was running for mayor of New York City. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=165.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=169.76s)]
*  We say, yo, if you want to be mayor, you got to come on flagrant. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=170.4s)]
*  The only way that you could be mayor of New York City is if you come on flagrant. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=173.68s)]
*  Yep. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=177.2s)]
*  Said it was too big of a risk. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=178.32s)]
*  And now look at him. Where is he? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  Selling insurance. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=181.36s)]
*  Anybody heard his name for five years? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=181.84s)]
*  Selling insurance in Wisconsin. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=183.44s)]
*  He has a nice podcast. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=185.28s)]
*  Does he? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=186.4s)]
*  That records out of WJM Media. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=186.88s)]
*  Oh my God. With all due respect, he's great. He's absolutely amazing. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=188.32s)]
*  Are you sure it's him? It is over in Canal Street. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=191.84s)]
*  So I don't want to. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=194.0s)]
*  I just want to make sure you're not being racist right now. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=196.64s)]
*  I'm having a baguette. He's delivering my sushi. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=198.64s)]
*  It is weird. It's weird that he collects rent from me at the end of the month. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=201.92s)]
*  That is a peculiar arrangement. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=205.52s)]
*  Now, yeah, just a wild time. It's just a wild time. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=207.44s)]
*  Okay. Let's get into a lot of different conversations. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=213.36s)]
*  How are things in your household? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=216.48s)]
*  Oh, I didn't tell y'all. Maybe I did tell y'all. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=218.24s)]
*  I tried to pull Larry David yesterday. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=220.56s)]
*  Because you know me, the idea of going to vote is just seems like such an effort. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=222.88000000000002s)]
*  I ain't doing that shit. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=226.24s)]
*  My address was in a different place and I was like, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=226.88000000000002s)]
*  I'm not going all the way up to that polling thing. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=229.44000000000003s)]
*  So my wife... [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  Five blocks away. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  No, no, I was on the 58th. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=234.0s)]
*  Because business manager put the address, like a whole thing, whatever. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=236.4s)]
*  Anyway, so I asked my wife, I'm like, who are you voting for? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=239.76000000000002s)]
*  She goes, I'm voting for Kamala. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=241.84s)]
*  We have a daughter and I'm worried about her reproductive rights. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=243.60000000000002s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=246.0s)]
*  And I was like, that's a good-ass point. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=246.56s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=248.16000000000003s)]
*  That's a good-ass point. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=248.72000000000003s)]
*  And then I also... [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=252.08s)]
*  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=253.12s)]
*  Women, smart women. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=254.56s)]
*  I also calculated, I was like, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=256.24s)]
*  probably got another couple of elections before their reproductive rights are gonna kick in. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=258.32s)]
*  I think we can fix that shit up. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=261.92s)]
*  We got about two or three more before we're gonna meet one of them. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=264.32s)]
*  Two or three, come on. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=267.92s)]
*  Wait, right? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=269.2s)]
*  About five or six, hopefully. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=269.6s)]
*  No, you're right, you're right. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=271.36s)]
*  Why am I even saying... [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=272.0s)]
*  Eight to 12 is crazy. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=273.12s)]
*  What are you talking about, man? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=274.56s)]

*  Yeah, it was. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=276.64s)]
*  Because how many years do I think Trump is gonna be there? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=277.36s)]
*  Forever. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=279.68s)]
*  You heard that, Shifty? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  MAGA. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=284.71999999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's right. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=285.28s)]
*  There's no more elections. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=286.0s)]
*  Shifty MAGA. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=286.96s)]
*  Yeah, we never have to vote again. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=288.0s)]
*  How convenient is that? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  There's no more elections, bro. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  Anyway, it's nice. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=291.2s)]
*  So I asked my wife, I'm like, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=292.0s)]
*  who are you voting for? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=293.91999999999996s)]
*  She goes, Kamala. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=294.47999999999996s)]
*  And I'm like, all right, look, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=295.44s)]
*  I wanna do a Larry David with you. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=298.24s)]
*  So I'm gonna vote Trump, you're gonna vote Kamala. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  If neither of us vote, then we did vote. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=302.88s)]
*  Because they cancel each other out. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=306.4s)]
*  This is a Larry David, Curb Your Enthusiasm episode. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=307.44s)]
*  She goes, all right, that kind of makes sense. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=310.15999999999997s)]
*  Then hits me up midway through the day. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=311.52s)]
*  I went and voted. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=313.2s)]
*  I said, this motherfucker. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=314.32s)]
*  I said, this motherfucker is trying to get one over on me. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=316.56s)]
*  I rolled right to the closest precinct. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=320.47999999999996s)]
*  I said, yo, can I vote here even though I'm not signed up? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=322.32s)]
*  And they were like, yeah, this is America. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=324.56s)]
*  You don't even need an ID. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=325.76s)]
*  You don't even need to speak English. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=326.64s)]
*  You can walk in here with a Venezuelan flag and a gun, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=328.4s)]
*  and you can vote. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=330.4s)]
*  So I walked in there and they were like, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=331.2s)]
*  you could sign an affidavit or some other bullshit. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=332.88s)]
*  And I just voted. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=335.44s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=337.44s)]
*  Evened it out. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=338.08s)]
*  They take them shit and throw them right out. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=338.71999999999997s)]
*  I gotta do extra work. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=341.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=342.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  All right, so let's get into this discussion real quick. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=343.44s)]
*  What do you think the real decision was that was made by the American public? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=347.68s)]
*  Economy. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=352.24s)]
*  In my estimation, this is what I think it was a [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=353.91999999999996s)]
*  referendum on liberal politics and leftist politics. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=356.79999999999995s)]
*  I don't think it was Trump populism. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=361.12s)]
*  I think a lot of people are going, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=362.64s)]
*  this is Trump is this amazing populist, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=363.84s)]
*  and he was just so engaging, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=365.84s)]
*  and everybody just fucking loved him. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=367.12s)]
*  No, I actually think in the same way that people voted anti-Trump, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=369.03999999999996s)]
*  let's say in 2020, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=374.15999999999997s)]
*  I think people were voting anti-democratic leadership in 2024. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=376.15999999999997s)]
*  And I think that's evident across the board. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, you saw your DA in California get knocked down. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  The Republicans flipped the Senate. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=388.0s)]
*  The voter turnout is much higher. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=390.47999999999996s)]
*  They win every, does he win every swing state? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=392.79999999999995s)]
*  I don't know if she got a single one, dude. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=395.67999999999995s)]
*  To me, it's a rejection of the current state of liberal politics [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=398.0s)]
*  and the fact that those people felt concerns [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=402.55999999999995s)]
*  that were not met by Democrats on the campaign trail. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=406.47999999999996s)]
*  They had no real answer for the border. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=409.52s)]
*  They just gaslit people about the border. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=411.91999999999996s)]
*  They had no real answer for the economy. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=414.47999999999996s)]
*  They had no real answer for anything. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=416.32s)]
*  I think it was one, a rejection of liberal politics, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=419.84s)]
*  and then two, just a truly once in a lifetime awful candidate. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=422.0s)]
*  I don't think that you can, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=426.08s)]
*  I don't think that you can, what is it? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=428.15999999999997s)]
*  Discredit or? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=431.35999999999996s)]
*  Discount. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=432.88s)]
*  I don't think you can discount that. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=434.32s)]
*  You need to have a star. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=436.64s)]
*  Yep. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=438.15999999999997s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=438.4s)]
*  When I saw Obama on the campaign trail, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=439.03999999999996s)]
*  I was like, holy shit, this guy's a fucking superstar. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=440.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=442.96s)]
*  And then you see her flopping around like a fish on a boat. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=443.44s)]
*  It was just brutal. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=448.4s)]
*  I think it was a rejection of leftist policies [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=451.91999999999996s)]
*  and leftist politics along with just a truly horrible candidate. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=455.2s)]
*  The other part of the politics I think that people were fed up with was [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=459.03999999999996s)]
*  just the games Democrats play in the guise of democracy. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=462.56s)]
*  And like, we're the ones who care about the people. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=465.59999999999997s)]
*  Nobody elected Kamala, just like nobody wanted Hillary in 2016. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=468.0s)]
*  You just, you're so here to have a woman president or whatever it is, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=471.03999999999996s)]
*  whatever your reasoning is, this is the corporate person. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=473.91999999999996s)]
*  Fuck actual democracy in action during the primaries. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=476.71999999999997s)]
*  Let's put in the candidate we want. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=479.76s)]
*  And then I think it's one of the worst campaigns. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=481.2s)]
*  I think she could be a good candidate. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=483.52s)]
*  Maybe the worst campaign I've ever seen. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=485.6s)]
*  Is legacy media done? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=487.04s)]
*  Legacy media is done. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=488.64s)]
*  So I have theories on this. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=490.64s)]
*  I think, okay, because you got to look at it two ways. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=493.76s)]
*  Is legacy media done or was Kamala so bad that even with the influence of legacy media, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=496.08s)]
*  they couldn't get it over the hump? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=502.4s)]
*  For example, if Michelle was running or if Barack was running [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=504.08s)]
*  with legacy media in its current state, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=508.4s)]
*  I think they might be able to still get it over the, it's a maybe. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=510.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=513.52s)]
*  So I don't think legacy media is completely done. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=514.88s)]
*  But I do think that there is something very interesting that happened here. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=517.4399999999999s)]
*  Legacy media still gets the eyeballs. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=521.36s)]
*  It still gets the views. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=523.68s)]
*  And it still has cultural influence. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=525.28s)]
*  Up until election night, we all thought that it was a close race. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=527.12s)]
*  That's legacy media. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=530.24s)]
*  That is constantly pushing narratives that not only is it close, she might be ahead. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=531.6s)]
*  Iowa's going to her. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=536.9599999999999s)]
*  She's going to flip all the states. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=538.3199999999999s)]
*  It's going to be an absolute mauling, right? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=539.6s)]
*  That is legacy media pushing a narrative and people believing said narrative. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=541.6s)]
*  Right? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=546.96s)]
*  So if you look at all the pollsters, they had her winning day off. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=547.2s)]
*  Outside of Polly Market, which I don't even know if you can credit because it's just dudes gambling. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=551.2s)]
*  It's like there's no actual women represented. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=554.88s)]
*  I was also like, women are gambling. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=556.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=557.9200000000001s)]
*  So I look at this. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=559.12s)]
*  I look at a legacy media and I'm like, okay, now here's the difference. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=562.08s)]
*  And I'm not just saying this because we're podcasters. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=569.0400000000001s)]
*  But Trump went on podcasts, did these long interviews, commonly did some podcasts too. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=571.28s)]
*  But most of them are short, very contrived interviews. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=579.4399999999999s)]
*  It was very controlled. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=581.8399999999999s)]
*  It was things edited out. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=583.12s)]
*  It was, you know, it wasn't exactly the free form speech that we're kind of used to. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=584.56s)]
*  Also specifically targeted to one demographic. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=589.1999999999999s)]
*  Like you could tell in the last month that the campaign was like, we want black people [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=592.8s)]
*  to come out and vote. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=595.68s)]
*  We really aren't trying to reach out to anybody else. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=596.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=598.3199999999999s)]
*  Which is a huge, I think, problem for them because they just got lower all around turnout. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=599.3000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=605.3000000000001s)]
*  And maybe if they spoke to more people, then more people could have been inspired. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=605.7s)]
*  But here's the thing that happens. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=608.4200000000001s)]
*  One thing that podcasting has done that's been really effective is built community and connection. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=611.94s)]
*  Right? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=618.1800000000001s)]
*  Like if you look at the biggest touring stand-up comedians in the world, right? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=618.4200000000001s)]
*  They all have podcasts where they've built this amazing community and connection. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=622.74s)]
*  We talk to people every single week. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=626.66s)]
*  They know intimate details about our life. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=628.02s)]
*  To me, what that's proven is that just because people are famous doesn't mean you go out. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=629.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=633.78s)]
*  Right? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=634.26s)]
*  Connection is actually what makes people go out. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=635.86s)]
*  There are comics on SNL that I don't know if they could sell out a weekend of shows at a comedy club. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=637.6999999999999s)]
*  They're on the biggest comedy platform in the world. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=644.5s)]
*  And then there are comics who have podcasts that can sell out arenas. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=648.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=651.6999999999999s)]
*  To me, the difference between new media and legacy media is connection. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=653.1600000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=657.48s)]
*  The purpose of this podcast is to get people to invest in our lives and then be along for that journey. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=658.5200000000001s)]
*  Be it we go do stand-up shows, we go do some sort of live tour, some live activation, just be part of our lives. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=665.08s)]
*  The purpose of legacy media is to sell depression pills. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=671.32s)]
*  That is the purpose of the show. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=674.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=676.76s)]
*  They're creating the show so that they can sell those depression pills. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=677.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=680.9200000000001s)]
*  That's not to say we don't have ads. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=681.16s)]
*  Of course we have ads. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=682.1999999999999s)]
*  We didn't originally. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=683.24s)]
*  For months, a year when we started this, the purpose of this was to build a community and a connection. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=684.4399999999999s)]
*  And I think that fatal flaw, her not going onto these podcasts, is that people weren't able to make that connection. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=690.1999999999999s)]
*  And just as people come out to shows because they build that connection with us here, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=697.48s)]
*  they came out to vote because he built that connection. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=701.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=703.8s)]
*  People leave the house. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=704.4399999999999s)]
*  When they didn't have to leave the house to vote, they voted for Biden. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=705.56s)]
*  They mailed it in. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=709.16s)]
*  When they had to leave the house to go to a stand-up show or leave the house to vote, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=710.2800000000001s)]
*  you better fucking, we talk about this all the time, it's an investment. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=714.12s)]
*  Putting on fucking clothes, standing in line for a couple hours. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=717.08s)]
*  And we only mailed it in because we were locked inside for six months. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=720.44s)]
*  We had nothing else to do. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=722.6s)]
*  For sure. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=723.6400000000001s)]
*  I'm not mailing in if I can go outside and do things. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=723.96s)]
*  Sure, sure. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=725.88s)]
*  Because we could have mailed in this time, but we're not. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=726.12s)]
*  I think when I say legacy media is done, I mean, they can still set a narrative, people still watch it. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=727.88s)]
*  Their influences, them being the most influential force in the world is done. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=732.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=736.76s)]
*  I don't know if, I wouldn't say done. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=737.1600000000001s)]
*  I would just say that they don't have the connectivity. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=738.76s)]
*  Sure. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=741.48s)]
*  And the great disruption with new media is the connectivity. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=742.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=745.8s)]
*  And before, and the reason why I create the analogy with comics is before there were comics [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=746.52s)]
*  that could sell out shows by being in a commercial. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=751.72s)]
*  They were in a commercial for Pepsi and they could sell out a week in a show [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=754.68s)]
*  just because there were so few famous people. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=757.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=759.16s)]
*  Now everybody has gone viral. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=759.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=761.72s)]
*  What type of connection do you have with your audience? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=762.04s)]
*  I think legacy media just hits a different crop of voters. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=764.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=767.0s)]
*  With the advent of TikTok, is Facebook done? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=767.64s)]
*  It's like, well, I think Facebook just kind of hits a different group of people [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=770.84s)]
*  in a different age bracket and a different geography. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=773.8s)]
*  And I think legacy media effectively does the same thing. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=776.12s)]
*  I think younger people are probably seeking connection more so. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=777.88s)]
*  And that community, specifically digitally, is probably more valuable to younger people, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=780.6s)]
*  whereas our parents are not listening to podcasts, but they'll probably tune in to CNN or Fox or [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=783.72s)]
*  whatever, and they'll watch that and then get their information based off that. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=789.16s)]
*  So I think mobilizing young people podcasts is the way to go. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=792.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=794.76s)]
*  And then as far as getting older people, I think you have to, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=795.08s)]
*  now are in a position where it's not pick one or the other, but you have to play both. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=797.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And she chose not to play one. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=801.72s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=806.84s)]
*  Or she played it in a specific way that I think hurt her negatively. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=807.5600000000001s)]
*  It's so dumb. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=810.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=812.0400000000001s)]
*  Like Call Her Daddy, I don't think you can discount. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=812.2800000000001s)]
*  Breakfast Club, I don't think you can discount. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=813.96s)]
*  But I think in order to get all of them, you need to do all of them. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=815.5600000000001s)]
*  Like they only did, outside of Call Her Daddy, it felt like they only did black podcasts. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=819.1600000000001s)]
*  And to me, if I'm an American voter, I'm almost like insulted by it. I'm like, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=825.0s)]
*  hey, we're here too. Like I know we don't live in fucking Wisconsin or Pennsylvania, but [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=828.5999999999999s)]
*  we also care about what you're going to do for us. And if you're just talking about these things [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=832.92s)]
*  the month before the election, we might feel like you don't give a fuck about what's going on for us. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=838.28s)]
*  The way I'm wired, if I'm a black voter, I'm sorry to interrupt. If I'm a black voter, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=842.12s)]
*  I started to feel a little insulted. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=844.92s)]
*  You feel pandered to? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=845.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Like what do you do? All you ever do is you're going to go have a fucking town hall. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=846.8399999999999s)]
*  You're going to go do all the smoke. And I got, those are great platforms, but like [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=850.92s)]
*  that's all you're going to do is just sit here and talk to me. Like this is the liberal thing [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=854.44s)]
*  where it's like, yo, you're not equal. You're a little less than us. So let's just pander to [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=857.48s)]
*  you like you're a fucking moron and you'll buy into it because you're so fucking stupid and helpless [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=862.12s)]
*  as a minority. Fuck you, suck my dick. Talk to America and I'll listen and I'll choose who I want. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=865.8000000000001s)]
*  Sorry, what were you going to say? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=871.08s)]
*  I think part of the reason Obama got elected was because he got a lot of the black people, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=872.84s)]
*  the black vote out to actually vote. A large percentage of the black community do not go out [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=879.4s)]
*  and vote. So I think that was part of the strategy of targeting a particular group to try to get them [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=884.4399999999999s)]
*  as happy and energized to get out to actually vote like Obama did. I think using podcasts was [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=890.12s)]
*  great strategy on both sides. This was the first election run that they ever did that. So it was [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=896.4399999999999s)]
*  like, it was hit or miss. Let's say Trump loses, people would have been like, ah, he wasted all [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=901.8s)]
*  that time going on podcasts instead of just going out and doing, just talking to the people. No, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=906.6s)]
*  no, no, no. People could have said that. This was a gamble. What do you say if Trump lost? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=911.24s)]
*  If he lost. I'll get to that. We'll go. And so it's like Obama's amazing strategy was [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=914.52s)]
*  utilizing social media during his run and that was never seen before. So I think it was just the [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=918.9200000000001s)]
*  fact that they tried new things and some worked, some didn't. And clearly Trump connected with [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=924.36s)]
*  people better than Come on. So if I can respond to that, sorry. I think this is, if you watch [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=929.5600000000001s)]
*  sports, this is what always happens. If a team goes for it on fourth down and they make it, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=933.96s)]
*  coach is a genius. If they don't, he's an idiot. It always hindsight influences everything. I think [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=936.9200000000001s)]
*  even if Trump lost personally, I would have been like, no, he lost because of January 6th. He lost [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=941.24s)]
*  because of XYZ, all these other things that happened outside of the podcast world. If you just look at [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=945.4000000000001s)]
*  raw numbers of Joe Rogan and say, oh, 60 million views on YouTube alone for a guy who's still [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=950.36s)]
*  bigger on audio, just hitting that raw number of people. If you're like, no, you know, it's going [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=955.5600000000001s)]
*  to win me the election. Let's go do a black podcast. That gets one, 100th of that. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=959.48s)]
*  Sean Lame said to me, the number one podcast with black listenership and viewership in the world [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=964.1999999999999s)]
*  is Joe Rogan. So you chose not to go on the biggest podcast for black people in the world. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=972.76s)]
*  Like that is a huge choice. And while doing that, you could have also hit all these other people as [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=981.4s)]
*  well. To me, the strategy is they weren't ready for the pushback and they want to go on platforms [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=987.8s)]
*  that we're going to be more comfortable with their control and their hands. Life tour, last few dates, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=992.5999999999999s)]

*  fucking thought? Anyway, November 22nd and 23rd, I'm going to be in Rochester at the Carlson. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1021.24s)]

*  Now they love me. I wonder why. Maybe because I got their president elected. Anyway, December 6th [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1035.72s)]
*  and 7th, I'm going to be in Auburn, New York. I think those are my last dates for the year, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1039.88s)]

*  get back to the show. Potsdown PA, this Friday, November 8th. I'm going to be at Soul Jolls. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1047.3999999999999s)]
*  I just had to double check. November 8th. November 8th. But then Stanford, Connecticut. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1055.24s)]
*  Do it again. Do it again. Let's do it again. Potsdown PA, this Friday, November 8th. I'm [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1060.52s)]
*  going to be at Soul Jolls. This Wednesday, Stanford, Connecticut. I'm going to be at New York [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1064.4399999999998s)]
*  Comedy Club. I can't wait to see you guys there. Is that it? Is that all we got? World's Fastest [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1067.96s)]
*  Ad Read. You didn't say New York Comedy Club. This could be your head right there, ladies. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1072.6000000000001s)]
*  You didn't say Stanford, Connecticut. I want to make it fast. That way people go. No, but they're [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1076.8400000000001s)]
*  going to think that it's New York Comedy Club. This ladies, right here. No, Stanford, Connecticut. New [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1080.2s)]
*  York Comedy Club. Your face. One more time. Right here. Or guys. If it's too long, if you want to [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1083.64s)]
*  skip. Hypothetically, let's say Kamala does go on Rogan, goes on Lex, goes on Theo. Does she win? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1087.96s)]
*  I don't think so. I think fundamentally the strategy of her campaign was flawed from the [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1094.84s)]
*  get-go. I think Biden largely like caboshed her odds by just pulling out so late. Even if she had [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1100.52s)]
*  done these things, I think it absolutely would have helped. But I don't think it would have [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1107.24s)]
*  won her the election. I think it would have won her the election if she was good. The reality is, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1110.04s)]
*  we'll never know if she was good because we were never giving her. The most real you've ever seen [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1115.48s)]
*  her is when she and Charlemagne were sitting down and I was like, Charlemagne, don't have any callers [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1121.0s)]
*  calling. I said, I'm really needy. I was like, you just need to talk to this woman for three fucking [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1126.1200000000001s)]
*  hours. That is the closest that we've seen her to being a real person and not just a politician. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1130.68s)]
*  Talk to her. That is the way that American can get to know her. America doesn't know her. They've [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1137.3200000000002s)]
*  seen her flip-flop on every single issue, which is okay. I'm okay if politicians change their mind. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1142.68s)]
*  I'm totally okay with that. But give me an explanation as to why they've seen her gaslight [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1147.08s)]
*  about the border, haven't answered a single fucking question about the border correctly, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1152.04s)]
*  or with any amount of confidence that made the American people believe that they were going to [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1155.6399999999999s)]
*  do something different. There are real issues that they didn't touch on. And I feel like Charlemagne [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1159.08s)]
*  could be, I'm biased, but I think he could have been the guy to actually push her to answer those [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1164.6s)]
*  questions. But like Mark said, I think Biden dropping out so late, fucked her up. Right on. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1169.72s)]
*  She didn't have enough time to prepare. I don't think if Biden doesn't run again and they have a [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1176.8400000000001s)]
*  primary, she don't win the primary. Bro, let's, we just got to call it what it is. Do you think it [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1181.4s)]
*  would have been different? Do you think it would have been different? I don't think she's good. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1185.0800000000002s)]
*  If she had more time to prepare for this run? No, I truly don't. I truly don't. Because the things [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1188.44s)]
*  you're complaining about is like, oh, hey, we didn't hear enough from her. No, no, no. Hey, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1193.64s)]
*  if you had more time to hear enough from her. The horse ain't fast. That's all it is. It's like, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1197.16s)]
*  the horse ain't fast. She's not a Ferrari, bro. No, I'm not disagreeing with that. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1201.24s)]
*  I'm really, so it's like, so far what we saw, she had plenty of opportunities to win us over. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1206.76s)]
*  It's not like she didn't have every single podcast that she could have gone. It's not like she, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1212.28s)]
*  she didn't go on one podcast that people said, yeah, you got to listen to this shit. It's kind [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1215.72s)]
*  of fire. No matter what she went on, people were like, this shit sucks. Right? The only thing that [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1219.24s)]
*  she did that was pretty good was the Brent Beyer thing on Fox. I think the Call of Dada. I like [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1224.12s)]
*  to call Dada to be honest. I thought in moment, I'm not, I wasn't like completely floored or [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1228.92s)]
*  whatever, but there were moments where I was like, that was really thoughtful. And it was a [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1233.4s)]
*  unique way of answering question. That question, it didn't sound like a robot was answering it. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1236.8400000000001s)]
*  And that was, maybe I was looking for very little. I saw that to your point. I would say, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1240.3600000000001s)]
*  not having time. You had ample opportunity to do Joe Rogan and said, oh, you need to come to me. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1243.8000000000002s)]
*  And I only give you an hour. And then these fucking liberal idiots were like, why won't Joe do that? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1248.92s)]
*  Joe is Oprah this day and age. If George W. Bush is running in 2000 and says, I want to be president [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1253.64s)]
*  Oprah, but I'm not coming to Chicago. It was a cop. You come to Texas and I give you 20 minutes. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1258.68s)]
*  Suck my dick. I'm not doing that. And we all got it. Joe got it. You want to be president. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1263.6399999999999s)]
*  Don't talk about 90 days. You needed a day, three hours, go to Rogan. You were campaigning [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1268.9199999999998s)]
*  right next door. Go to Rogan. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. I hear what you're saying, bro. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1274.52s)]
*  It's fine. It's still something new. We can't cop, we can't cop, please. Well, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1278.36s)]
*  that's what people are going to do because they don't want to acknowledge what just happened. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1281.32s)]
*  They don't want to acknowledge the reality. There's going to be some people that I think [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1284.84s)]
*  will move on from this and be like, Hey, the Democratic party did not address the needs of [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1287.96s)]
*  the people. That's why the people overwhelmingly rejected them. And hopefully the people that are [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1292.92s)]
*  thinking that are the people in control of the Democratic party, because I don't think anything [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1298.76s)]
*  would make us happier. Think about this right now. Like everybody's looking at Trump, right? As if [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1301.96s)]
*  he's like this big bad Republican. Who is surrounding Trump right now? Tell me his team. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1306.3600000000001s)]
*  Elon. Democrat. RFK is a, was a lifelong Democrat. Who else? Tulsi. Democrat. Who else? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1312.12s)]
*  Vivek. Democrat. Who else? I don't know if Vivek was a Democrat. I thought he was a, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1321.48s)]
*  I thought he was a lifelong Democrat. Not that I know of. Okay. But either way, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1325.8799999999999s)]
*  my point is, and who has got Kamala's back? Liz Cheney. Oh my God. Say, get the fuck out of here. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1330.36s)]
*  My point is you have Obama and Michelle. I mean, Obama and Michelle is a different thing. They are [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1338.2s)]
*  the institution of the Democratic party. Vivek did vote for Obama, he admitted. He was a libertarian. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1345.24s)]
*  The point that I'm trying to make is that like, she is the representative of the institution and [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1351.32s)]
*  the institution wasn't meeting the demands of the people. I mean, the Democrats haven't won an [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1357.32s)]
*  election in the last 20 years that wasn't Obama or Obama's VP. Think about that. Like, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1362.76s)]
*  we're really just voting for Obama and she was too derivative. That's how much we love Obama. We're [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1369.16s)]
*  like, if you're close enough to Obama, we'll vote for you. Hillary, you weren't close enough. Matter [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1373.8799999999999s)]
*  of fact, I think you went after him a little bit. So we remember that shit. So I just don't think [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1378.6s)]
*  Democrats met the people. And the reality is those people that are surrounding Trump right now are [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1385.32s)]
*  these homeless Democrats, these lifelong Democrats, like many of us, lifelong Democrats, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1391.8s)]
*  that feel like the party has left us. Those are the people. I mean, look at this, like a perfect [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1395.72s)]
*  metaphor for what's happening right now in America. Those people right there are going, all right, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1401.72s)]
*  I'm going to ride with this guy because he at least sees what's happening and he sees that the [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1405.1599999999999s)]
*  left has gone too far. And you know what? They went there and they were called prides, they're [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1408.68s)]
*  called assholes, they're called every name under the book. And the rest of America, the majority [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1413.24s)]
*  went, now we feel that way too. The Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney endorsement, like the fact that she [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1417.4s)]
*  touted it was such a strategic error. Nuclear bomb. I don't understand why. I didn't get that one. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1422.8400000000001s)]
*  The name Cheney, I mean, is, I don't know if there's a worse name in politics. I saw an interesting [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1427.0800000000002s)]
*  tweet when he left as VP, he had like a 16% approval rating, which is the same as Nixon. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1432.44s)]
*  And this would be the equivalent of like Clinton running being like, oh, I got Nixon's endorsement, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1438.2s)]
*  guys, you should vote for me. It's like, it's crazy. And then Dave Smith posted a clip and this [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1442.6000000000001s)]
*  is just again, legacy media and like us not believing it. A clip of Whoopi saying to Liz [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1447.16s)]
*  Cheney on the view, you should be attorney general. I just think you're awesome. And we're like, what [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1451.64s)]
*  the fuck is, people are seeing like, this is insane, right? Watching legacy media say Liz Cheney should, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1455.8000000000002s)]
*  hey, let's put another Cheney in a high position because we trust him. Yeah. So let's look back [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1462.3600000000001s)]
*  at this. This is a kind of interesting thing. Obviously we witnessed something pretty profound [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1466.68s)]
*  that's happened. Whether you like it or not, I hope we're all in this position right now where [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1471.72s)]
*  we want it to work out. Yeah. You know, there was a great moment when Chappelle was doing SNL. Yeah. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1475.88s)]
*  I think after Trump won the first time, he was like, I am rooting for you and I hope it works out. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1482.0400000000002s)]
*  It was this beautiful moment. Yeah. I hope you give us the same chance I'm giving you. Yeah. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1488.6000000000001s)]
*  It was beautiful. It was like, it was really, it was so mature. Yeah. It's so easy to be like angry [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1492.8400000000001s)]
*  and come up with excuses and all this. None of that's going to stop what's going on. Yeah. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1498.44s)]
*  Right now we got to hope that the best years of America are in front of us. Yeah. And I hope [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1501.96s)]
*  that this is the golden age once again of America. Like I don't think anything would make Americans [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1509.8000000000002s)]
*  happier if this wasn't the next golden age that we walked right into. Right now, coming up into [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1515.8000000000002s)]
*  this election, I think we can all agree that we're in an all time low confidence in the [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1521.0s)]
*  institutions in America, right? We didn't touch shit. In our lifetime for sure. I think that's [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1526.2s)]
*  why she lost. And I think the biggest reason why she lost is she didn't do a good enough job [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1530.8400000000001s)]
*  of showing that she will be changed. Yeah. Yeah. That's the best. She's actually said, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1536.04s)]
*  I wouldn't be happy. People aren't happy and she's more of this. Yeah. They wanted to change [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1541.96s)]
*  president and they said, would you have done anything different than Biden? She goes, no. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1546.52s)]
*  That's the biggest reason. That lost her. And I think the economic element of that, I don't [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1550.1200000000001s)]
*  think can be understated. Which is the change that you want to experience is an economic one. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1555.4s)]
*  Yeah. And she's basically saying, I don't think he did anything wrong. Yeah. You're sitting at [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1560.12s)]
*  home going, I can't afford food anymore than the social issues personally. Like maybe those things [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1563.4799999999998s)]
*  factor in. But I do think the idea of people being like, fuck bread is this expensive. Fucking, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1568.36s)]
*  I got to buy eggs and gas. And whatever you're mad about, whether it's bread, whether it's migrants, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1572.28s)]
*  whether it's reproductive rights, like anything bad that happened in the last four, if you don't [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1576.12s)]
*  distance yourself away from that, what that person is mad about, you're the reason for it. Yeah. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1580.28s)]
*  And I saw interesting analysis of Obama's election ads, like the ones that he paid for in [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1585.48s)]
*  Kamala's and they did an analysis between them. And the majority of his were economic. It's like, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1591.08s)]
*  hey, we're going to fix this. He's coming out of the recession. And then even with the second term, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1595.32s)]
*  the economy is not fixed perfectly. But he's like, look, we need to change this. They showed Gresham [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1599.0s)]
*  Whitmer when she was running, that she was like, look, inflation is crazy, da da da da da. And then [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1602.52s)]
*  while Kamala's running, there's all these pieces done by these democratic political writers being [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1606.92s)]
*  like, guys, the economy is actually great. And they're gaslighting the general public and being [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1610.6s)]
*  like, guys, whatever you're feeling is actually not true. And whether or not things actually are [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1614.52s)]
*  on the numbers, people feel like it's not. You have to address their feelings. And they [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1618.84s)]
*  neglect the feeling. And as a result, it doesn't matter what it actually is. It's how people feel. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1622.76s)]
*  And people in the middle of the country that feel like, oh, this is not going well, the inflation's [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1626.68s)]
*  going crazy. The fact that she neglected that and then was going hard. And they even did like [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1630.12s)]
*  political polling in Pennsylvania, being like going at Democrats. Okay, which one of these [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1634.36s)]
*  campaign slogans resonates the most with you? It was economic policy was resonating the most. And [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1638.6s)]
*  then Trump being a threat to democracy resonating the least. And then looking at Kamala's campaign [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1642.52s)]
*  things, it was like 30% was Trump is a threat to democracy. 30% is like abortion and social issues. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1647.6399999999999s)]
*  And then like a tiny little fraction, like five to 10% was economic. And so she didn't distance [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1654.04s)]
*  distance herself from the current economic system. And then kind of went too wide with all these other [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1658.84s)]
*  issues. Whereas Trump is just like, hey, we'll fix the economy. I'm a business guy, da da da da. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1663.96s)]
*  I think Trump is generally beatable from a lot of other Democratic candidates. I think they could [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1668.36s)]
*  have run people. I don't think he's like an unbeatable guy. I mean, Biden beat him. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1672.76s)]
*  And Pete would kill them. And so with that being said, it's like they just ran a bad person too [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1676.1999999999998s)]
*  late with a bad strategy. Yeah, I'm trying to think. I don't know who beats him. Honestly, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1680.6799999999998s)]
*  I think that I think Pete is incredibly astute and charming and eloquent. There is a pathway to him [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1684.84s)]
*  becoming president and he just has to say that he's the top. I know it sounds crazy, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1692.04s)]
*  but I know it sounds crazy. But if he said this before, it's not gay for the top. Oh, no, no, no. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1697.4s)]
*  He might have said on Patreon, it's not gay for the top. Well, I think America would be like, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1702.44s)]
*  yeah, all right, whatever. Yeah, I genuinely. But the idea that like he's getting bent over with his [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1706.68s)]
*  back arched and his boyfriend is like having his fingers in his mouth and pulling them like that. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1712.44s)]
*  Dude, what do you think about this? Yeah, that's what you guys are going to be thinking about in [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1717.0s)]
*  the booth. What the hell? When you're filling out your affidavits, that's what's going to be. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1721.4s)]
*  And you kind of lean over to vote, too. Like you're kind of bent over a little. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1725.0s)]
*  You're kind of just over your shoulder. Yeah. So if he's the top, I think he could definitely win. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1727.72s)]
*  And it sucks. Isn't that a shame? But he could be the top. There's a 50% chance. Really. And [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1732.04s)]
*  honestly, I don't know if Trump could beat a man. Yeah, that's true. So far, he's only beaten women. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1737.32s)]
*  Yeah, but he used to fuck out of women. He destroys women. He fucks women up. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1742.12s)]
*  Yo, no woman ever run against fucking Trump. Yo, I was thinking this because people were saying like, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1747.64s)]
*  it's just sad that people don't care about women's rights and blah, blah, blah. I think [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1752.84s)]
*  when you go into voting booth, you've got kids and you are hurting financially. It's like, hey, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1756.36s)]
*  man, all that shit sucks. But this is kill. I need to feed my kids. And that's all that's going to [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1760.4399999999998s)]
*  matter. I do still think so many of this could have so much of this could have been fixed campaign [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1764.6s)]
*  wise. Like instead of saying, hey, I wouldn't have distanced anything from Biden. You know what? We [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1769.32s)]
*  definitely didn't do anything perfect. You want to sell him out? Great. Well, you know, Biden and I [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1774.12s)]
*  did everything together. We're a team. Sell his ass out. We made some mistakes. Sell his ass out. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1777.24s)]
*  He wouldn't even know you were selling him out. This is so funny that Biden called me the N word. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1781.4s)]
*  That's what I would say. Day one. Sell his ass out. I'd vote for Biden again. Yeah, I thought we [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1785.24s)]
*  voted for Biden. Let him run again. Let him walk up the stairs. I also think we talk about this [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1792.0400000000002s)]
*  strategy is if there's not like it's one person making the decision. There's hundreds of billions [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1798.2s)]
*  of dollars behind each of these decisions. So for y'all to fuck up this hard is insane to me. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1801.8000000000002s)]
*  For you to not understand the reach of podcasts, you're not just Kamala Harris. They understood it. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1806.76s)]
*  They didn't want the risk. That's what I think it is. And they didn't want her to be exposed. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1811.72s)]
*  High risk, high reward. But Trump's not worried about it. But you know what I mean? Like he's like, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1815.3200000000002s)]
*  I can handle this. I'm used to people saying the worst possible thing about me for the last fucking [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1821.4s)]
*  eight years. It doesn't even matter. So whereas Kamala, they basically they had to protect her a [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1825.48s)]
*  little bit, you know, is what it is. Yeah. OK, so moving forward. You asked in the group chat, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1829.8s)]
*  what day was it like a big Sunday or Monday? Like we thought would win. And I was I think I [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1835.56s)]
*  was the only one who thought Trump because I just felt the climate like I've never seen this much [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1839.6399999999999s)]
*  excitement for Trump. You wore your red hat today. Respect. Respect that. That's a secret. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1845.08s)]
*  You did wear a red hat. I'm about unity, guys. Now, here's the thing. We're on the road every [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1850.12s)]
*  weekend for shows. I did tell you guys. Don't do this. Don't do this. Seriously. Don't do this. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1856.44s)]
*  Oh, my God. I told you guys. I go, I go, it's going to be a mauling. There's no way that he [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1864.92s)]
*  loses this. How many of you said that? Now, let me tell you real quick. I'm on the road every weekend [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1871.56s)]
*  for shows. You always read the text. I come back and I go, I go, I think it's going to be a mauling. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1875.56s)]
*  I don't see how he could win. The energy. Were you on the road this weekend? No. Where were you [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1880.28s)]
*  performing? I was in the city the night before and I foolishly decided to ask some audience members [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1884.6s)]
*  who they were voting for and why. Some women spoke back. Weird. Not anymore. Those days are done. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1891.0s)]
*  So basically they spoke back and it seemed like they were really [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1902.6799999999998s)]
*  perturbed about the Roe v Wade ruling. What was that? Perturbed? No, that was the abortion thing? [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1906.2800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, and here's the reality if we just want to talk about it. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1914.92s)]
*  Talk about it. You know what I mean? These women, man, they, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1923.0800000000002s)]
*  can I be honest with you? Please. No, no, it's not even that crazy thing. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1929.64s)]
*  I think that there are women who will never get an abortion in their life [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1938.44s)]
*  that still don't like the idea that something was taken away from them. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1943.48s)]
*  And it's, abortion is like their guns. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? It's just like, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1947.96s)]
*  we were allowed to do it and now we're not allowed to. Abortion is our guns. It's actually a fire. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1954.28s)]
*  It's actually a fire point. Thank you. You thought Kamala was going to win because you asked [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1959.1599999999999s)]
*  a comedy audience in New York City. I didn't think she was going to win. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1963.32s)]

*  The comedy seller, Saturday Night Online. No, no, no, no, no, no, it was a Monday. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1971.96s)]
*  It was a Monday. Let me tell you something. Let me tell you something. You should get a job on Kamala's [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1977.72s)]
*  team. Who would have fucking unbelieveable. Let me tell you something. This is why, this is what I [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1982.1999999999998s)]
*  realized. I don't talk to women. Okay. I have a wife. I talk to her. When I'm done talking to her, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1986.76s)]

*  Okay. She didn't talk to me enough about this Roe V Wade thing. You know, I didn't get enough [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=1999.4s)]
*  Roe V Wade information for her. You know, she's busy trying to book a trip to Paris. That don't [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2006.44s)]

*  Hey, we didn't want that shit to happen. What do you mean? Texas is a very anti-abortion place. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2089.4s)]
*  Yeah, but you are very getting nutted in place. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2094.12s)]
*  Girls in Texas like to get comedic. Is that a thing? Dude, everybody knows that. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2099.08s)]
*  It is one of the things that we would talk about amongst comedians on the road. We were like, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2102.92s)]

*  The latest term ever. The mom shows up like, I could have done this shit for you. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2170.44s)]
*  Bro, did you hear about the woman that went into that suicide chamber? [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2175.32s)]
*  This is like, they have like the euthanasia chambers and some girl went into it, like did [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2178.6s)]
*  the first successful euthanasia and then they looked at the body. There's like strangle marks [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2181.96s)]
*  on her neck apparently. And that pot in the woods. The chamber just has someone else in there. It [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2185.7999999999997s)]
*  just strangles the life out of you. That's fucking disgusting. But now they're looking into it. They [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2192.92s)]
*  think it might be foul play that someone killed someone and put them in there. They're like, no, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2197.0s)]
*  I should kill myself. I don't know all the details. That makes a lot more sense than you go to a pot [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2199.72s)]
*  and the guy walks out and he jokes. Yeah. It's more like DIY. It's more like a DIY euthanasia [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2204.36s)]
*  chamber. Mark, this is terrifying. Not in Trump's America. Not in Trump's America would have this [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2210.2000000000003s)]
*  kind of stuff. So what are we getting? Because I do think we swung, we were the beginning. American [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2214.44s)]
*  Golden Age. No, I mean, what are we getting? The American Golden Age. We are the tipping point. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2218.2000000000003s)]
*  I believe this. Before we get into that, can't we just talk about like what we hope to see the next [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2221.8s)]
*  four years in America, right? What we would like in an ideal world. They put Roe v. Wade back on, [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2227.8s)]
*  turn that back on, flip that one. He gets to replace two Supreme Court justices, probably. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2235.32s)]
*  He might pick two people that are low key pro-choice. Because I don't think he was pro-choice. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2240.1200000000003s)]
*  I think he just wanted to win the election. What the fuck about it? What's the deal with that? Are [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2245.4s)]
*  we banging on these people dying? I think two might retire just because this is what the Democrats [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2248.52s)]
*  didn't do. Let me just get out now in case I die and there's a Democrat in office. And then [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2253.6400000000003s)]
*  we could lose our seats. Democrats are selfish, corrupt fucks. And Ruth Big, RBG was like, I'll [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2257.56s)]
*  just die and fuck women in the future. But I think two of the conservative ones might be like, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2261.7999999999997s)]
*  let's just get out while they're getting this good. And he can appoint two conservative [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2266.6s)]
*  people in my place. I understand. But he's still got to get them past the Senate. And they all [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2270.2s)]
*  step down unless they know who he's putting in place and they have to be. Yeah. Okay. But basically, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2274.2s)]
*  I think the smart move would be to protect Roe v. Wade and make an effort to protect it. And don't [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2279.96s)]
*  do this thing where you're just like, well, I'm going to let the states decide. No, federally [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2285.32s)]
*  protect it. I think that's what the majority of Americans would want right now. What makes you [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2288.84s)]
*  think he's going to do it? Is it wishful thinking? When they said they're going to take inflation [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2293.7200000000003s)]
*  down, we go, I hope. None of them know how to do it. But like, this is what you would hope. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2301.88s)]
*  We're just fantasizing. Like someone wins president in eighth grade, you're like, I'm going to make [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2306.76s)]
*  the soda and the water. So reparations. Yes. That's it. That's it. Wait, can we do reparations [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2310.04s)]
*  for all disenfranchised people? No. Why? No. Us first. Let's do gay reparations first. Gay [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2316.68s)]
*  reparations. They got the most money anyway. No, gay reparations. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2321.88s)]
*  Think about all the Broadway shows that didn't happen that they could have got paid for. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2329.48s)]
*  That's what I'm saying, bro. Let's do gay reparations. It'll be black reparations. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2333.24s)]
*  All right, guys, listen, probably at some point in this episode, I'm not exactly sure when we [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2335.96s)]
*  talked about the election and how Trump waxed that ass. You could have bet on it. Could have bet on [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2339.88s)]
*  it. You could have won with stake. You could have bet. You could have put your money where your mouth [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2345.0s)]
*  was. Yeah. In the mouth. Did I do it? Did I bet on it? Yeah. Yep. No, I didn't. No, you fucked up. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2348.52s)]
*  I fucked up. Because you knew based on your shows as a comedy seller, how things are going to go. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2354.6s)]
*  You're 100% right about that. But the point is you can bet on really almost anything. I mean, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2358.76s)]
*  stake is the leader in global betting and US social casinos. Really? I don't even know what [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2364.2s)]
*  a US social casino is. Do you know what it is? I don't know what a US social casino is. Do you [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2370.68s)]
*  know what it is? Gamble your friendship. It's a legal casino is what it is. Is that really what [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2376.6s)]
*  it is? Yeah. We need to get to the bottom of that immediately, Jamil. I don't think that people [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2380.6s)]
*  really know what a US social casino is. Why don't they find out at stake? Shit. Stake.com. Stake.com. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2384.8399999999997s)]
*  Listen, if you use the promo code flagrant, you're going to get a welcome bonus. Welcome. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2391.72s)]
*  Shit. That shit is almost as nice as a gift basket. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2396.6s)]
*  But I'm serious. There are things that we could be gambling on. Will the Democrats storm the [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2405.64s)]
*  Capitol? Yes. Please. Will they do it? Pussy hats, blue hair, busting down the doors. January 6th. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2413.72s)]
*  Who wants to get hit in the head with this shit? No. Listen, we got to get back to the show. But [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2421.0s)]
*  listen, let's all hang out at the social casino later. Let's get back to the show, man. Okay. No, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2427.56s)]
*  in all seriousness, what do we hope happens? There's been talk about Elon getting involved [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2433.48s)]
*  and what is it? The agency of efficiency, right? And cutting a lot of the bloat in government. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2438.68s)]
*  Do we think that that is a good idea? What would that look like? It's a great idea. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2445.24s)]
*  If anything gets done on that front, it'd be a win. But I think it's going to be hard to get a [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2449.4s)]
*  single thing done on that front. I think the problem is with a lot of these organizations, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2452.84s)]
*  is a government organization will come up and they'll come up in support of fixing a real problem. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2456.6s)]
*  Let's say that problem is cats getting in trees, right? And that agency lobbies to get some laws [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2465.2400000000002s)]
*  passed to make the trees all be covered in steel so the cats can't climb them or whatever. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2474.2s)]
*  All the trees are covered in steel, cats can't climb the trees. We solved the problem. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2481.48s)]
*  Okay. I like it. I like it. I'm trying to speak to real American people here. You fucking liberal [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2485.48s)]
*  cucks, you coastal elites laughing at my metaphor that actually taps into the heartstrings of good [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2491.8799999999997s)]
*  American people. Okay. Thank you. I understand. Okay. You wrap the steel around the trees. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2498.92s)]
*  All right. Especially the willows and the oaks. And when the willows and oaks are completely [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2508.84s)]
*  wrapped, the cats cannot climb up them. Why didn't you just go with homelessness? [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2513.32s)]
*  It's too real for people. It's too real for people. It's too painful. Anyway, I think I've [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2516.92s)]
*  got a great solution to cats and trees, by the way, and nobody's talking about it. I need a little [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2526.76s)]
*  bit of credit for this. Okay. Think about how many people lose their cat in a fucking tree and they [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2530.92s)]
*  just got to sit there until it runs out of energy and falls down. They solve homelessness. You know [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2535.1600000000003s)]
*  what? Fuck America. I'm moving to Mexico. So they solved the problem. Now do all those people that [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2542.6800000000003s)]
*  work at the cats in the trees problem agency, do they immediately retire after they come up with [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2551.8s)]
*  the genius solution to wrap steel around the trees? No, Kipa still got him. Kipa got him. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2557.1600000000003s)]
*  Purpose. So what do they do? Trans rights. See, if y'all just let me cook, I get there. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2563.0s)]
*  I saw the vision. I saw the vision. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2572.92s)]
*  Chef Boyard salty in the motherfucking building. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2574.92s)]
*  Okay. So the point is, so they find another cause and the causes get more and more extreme [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2587.8s)]
*  and they get more and more ridiculous, but I have empathy for these people, right? These people are [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2591.2400000000002s)]
*  working, they solve the job and they're like, well, I'm not going to fucking retire and go [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2596.12s)]
*  find another job. This is where I work. Some of these organizations I'm sure are doing things [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2599.16s)]
*  that are in the level of necessity, very similar to Kipa and they can fucking get snipped. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2603.48s)]
*  Absolutely. There's certainly there's waste in the institutions and you just hope that [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2611.24s)]
*  they're able to strategically and surgically cut out the waste in the blow without making the [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2614.04s)]
*  correction. But when you say it like that, nobody understands it. When you say it like me, they're [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2617.64s)]
*  like, yo, we got to fucking wrap steel around trees because cats are getting stuck up their [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2620.7599999999998s)]
*  organization. Get rid of it. As much as a genius as Elon is, does he do it strategically? Because [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2625.4s)]
*  he went into Twitter, cut like 70 to 80% of the staff and Twitter's still down like 80% of his [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2632.1200000000003s)]
*  value since he'd taken over. But yeah, but that's perception based and I'm okay with cutting a lot [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2639.0800000000004s)]
*  of government jobs. Like Vivek said, you cut a little muscle, that's all right with me. You [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2643.1600000000003s)]
*  save a lot of what is that famous saying? Cut my life into pieces. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2647.64s)]
*  Suffocation. No breathing. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2652.6s)]
*  Honestly, a great counterpoint. Yeah, sad guru said that. So I think, I think, why is he so sad? [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2660.12s)]
*  It is a little bit obnoxious. You're not doing your job. If you're a sad guru, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2667.56s)]
*  you know, it should be enlightened. Talk that shit. That's the whole point. Yeah. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2671.08s)]
*  It's Trump's America. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2677.7999999999997s)]
*  If mud beat paper, we would be fucked. That's a sick name for the gang, bro. Dude, muds and [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2683.96s)]
*  crips. That's what it's all about. You know what I'm saying? What's up, muds and the crips? [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2690.8399999999997s)]
*  I kind of like it. That is kind of cool. All right. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2695.16s)]
*  In all seriousness, what do we expect from America? Jesus. I can say it now. Why? Trump won. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2700.04s)]
*  That's all right. We back. Let's go. No, no, no. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2707.56s)]
*  One more time. You can think of some more. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2716.76s)]
*  No, but I got nothing. What else can we expect for America? Obviously, abortions can come back. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2724.52s)]
*  You've been right about every abortion date you've had. When abortion comes back, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2731.96s)]
*  When abortion comes back, ladies, stop being so cavalier about it. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2737.4s)]
*  That is important. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2743.4s)]
*  We had abortion and then Lena Dunham was out there like, [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2745.4s)]
*  one of my greatest regrets is I ain't getting abortion. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2748.4s)]
*  First of all, that's not totally up to you. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2751.4s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2754.4s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2757.4s)]
*  That pullout game was on Usain Bolt. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2760.4s)]
*  I was stroking her down. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2763.4s)]
*  She could have got a donor, she could have got a sperm donor. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2765.4s)]
*  Just a scoop? [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2767.4s)]
*  You are diabolical. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2769.4s)]
*  You are fucking diabolical, Mark. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2771.4s)]
*  Did anybody on the transverse try to transition to get an abortion? [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2773.4s)]

*  There you go. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2887.4s)]
*  Basically what happened was we recorded our whoop scores. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2888.4s)]
*  I won by unanimous decision. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2890.4s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2892.4s)]
*  In Donald Trump's America, I won by unanimous decision. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2893.4s)]
*  It won by the electoral score and the popular vote. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2897.4s)]
*  I won the electoral college. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2899.4s)]
*  There's voter fraud. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2901.4s)]
*  There's no voter fraud. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2902.4s)]
*  I won the electoral college. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2903.4s)]
*  I thwarted all of the liberal things. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2904.4s)]
*  And basically what's happening now is that my sleep score is absolutely incredible. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2909.4s)]
*  I've had zero alcohol consumption in the last 30 days. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2915.4s)]
*  And I've been getting along with my wife a lot better. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2920.4s)]
*  Turns out when you don't drink alcohol and you sleep a lot more, your marriage is essentially [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2923.4s)]
*  fixed. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2928.4s)]

*  I would look at my HRV score. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2931.4s)]
*  Is that it? [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2932.4s)]
*  HRV. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2933.4s)]
*  Heart rate variability is correct. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2934.4s)]
*  I would look at my HRV score when I would get bricked and I would throw it in the waistband. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2935.4s)]
*  Packing. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=2942.4s)]

*  The Houthis. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3089.4s)]
*  They're in Yemen and they, day one, were like, yo, my bad. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3090.4s)]
*  Oh, what? [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3091.4s)]
*  Day one, they said, my bad. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3092.4s)]
*  They said, my bad. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3094.4s)]
*  I don't know how they pronounce it. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3095.4s)]
*  Is this true? [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3096.4s)]
*  What does that translate to in Arabic? [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3097.4s)]
*  They're like, something of the sort. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3098.4s)]
*  It means kill the Jews. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3099.4s)]
*  Our operations in the waters off because they basically target ships that are passing and [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3100.4s)]

*  Iran, they need to be worried. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3126.4s)]
*  Oh. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3129.4s)]
*  Because he thinks they try to take him out, right? [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3130.4s)]
*  Oh, fuck yeah. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3133.4s)]
*  That's the first people I'm getting my get back on. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3135.4s)]
*  Let's go get our corners, Doug. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3138.4s)]
*  What about Russia, Ukraine? [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3140.4s)]
*  That's just done. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3142.4s)]
*  He said he would stop that. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3143.4s)]
*  That's over immediately. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3144.4s)]
*  That's over immediately. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3145.4s)]
*  What about these Jews? [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3146.4s)]
*  I mean, if there is any, if there's any justification or reason why I would think that they're very [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3148.4s)]
*  happy, it's the fact that I didn't want to go to 58th street to that polling station [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3153.4s)]
*  and Tanya goes, I'll drive you. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3157.4s)]
*  So I think we know what side the Jews are on. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3160.4s)]
*  Are they banned on TikTok? [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3163.4s)]
*  No. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3165.4s)]
*  No. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3166.4s)]
*  I mean, I think it's a good thing that they're banned. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3167.4s)]
*  I would say that's a good thing. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3170.4s)]
*  Are they banned on TikTok? [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3174.4s)]
*  No. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3176.4s)]
*  Why not? [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3177.4s)]
*  You don't have to do that now. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3178.4s)]
*  It's Chinese. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3181.4s)]
*  No, we should ban TikTok. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3182.4s)]
*  He can't make the US buy TikTok. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3185.4s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3188.4s)]
*  I think TikTok is fine. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3189.4s)]
*  Even if it's controlled by the Chinese government? [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3191.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3193.4s)]
*  What's your deal, dude? [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3194.4s)]
*  Well, okay, my honest answer is Trump has already elected. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3195.4s)]
*  You can't win reelection, so he's not really worried about that. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3200.4s)]
*  So he's like, all right, do whatever you want. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3203.4s)]
*  Like, you can influence the next election, but it's not going to be me involved. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3205.4s)]
*  So I'm going to go fuck. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3208.4s)]
*  That's my perception. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3209.4s)]
*  I think TikTok in terms of influencing election that he's involved in is way more concerning [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3211.4s)]
*  for him than the following election. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3215.4s)]
*  And I think by the next election, he's like, I'm 82. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3217.4s)]
*  If my kids aren't running, which I don't think any of them will, is like, I don't know how [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3219.4s)]
*  involved he's going to be, but I can't imagine it's going to be bad. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3224.4s)]
*  What about all the tweets? [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3227.4s)]
*  I've seen people say like, oh, America's over. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3228.4s)]
*  This guy's going to take project 2025 is going to destroy the country. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3230.4s)]
*  No, I don't think he's in a project 2025. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3233.4s)]
*  I don't think he I'm not saying everything he said was honest, but I didn't believe I [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3235.4s)]
*  believed him when he said I got nothing to do with that. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3239.4s)]
*  That was one thing I believed. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3241.4s)]
*  I didn't believe him when he told me I'm going to dial back the rhetoric that I have a hard [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3242.4s)]
*  time believing. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3246.4s)]
*  But when he was like that, because that just doesn't sound like his shit at all. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3247.4s)]
*  And he doesn't seem like he is going to do something because they tell him to either [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3251.4s)]
*  part. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3255.4s)]
*  Anybody. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3256.4s)]
*  Like you're not going to tell me what to do, no matter what fucking who you are. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3257.4s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3259.4s)]
*  I'm going to do what I want to do. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3260.4s)]
*  You're going to try and push it. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3261.4s)]
*  Little shit. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3262.4s)]
*  I mean, it's not going to happen. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3263.4s)]
*  Now. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3264.4s)]
*  Now. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3265.4s)]
*  Now there's a part of me that goes like, he might look back and see FDR got three terms. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3266.4s)]
*  No, that might happen. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3270.4s)]
*  Somebody just got to not tell Trump that FDR got three terms because it's very possible [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3272.4s)]
*  Trump has no clue FDR was in there for three terms. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3276.4s)]
*  But once he finds that shit out of there, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3279.4s)]
*  The fuck did that legless dude get to do three terms as president? [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3283.4s)]
*  I'm definitely running back for one more. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3286.4s)]
*  Bloomberg got an extra term when he was mayor. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3289.4s)]
*  Bloomberg. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3291.4s)]
*  We should run that back to be honest with you. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3292.4s)]
*  Of course. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3293.4s)]
*  I'm so there is a world where that happens and I would be super against that. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3294.4s)]
*  I would be so against that. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3298.4s)]
*  That would be the worst part. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3301.4s)]
*  No, no, in all seriousness, in all seriousness, I'd be very much against that. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3302.4s)]
*  And I think that is that would be cause for concern. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3304.4s)]
*  But I don't think he'll go after that. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3308.4s)]
*  Genuinely. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3309.4s)]
*  I genuinely don't think it. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3310.4s)]
*  I genuinely don't think it. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3312.4s)]
*  Well, they wrote an amendment against it. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3313.4s)]
*  After FDR, right? [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3315.4s)]
*  So there was no rule before that? [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3316.4s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3318.4s)]
*  There wasn't. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3319.4s)]
*  There was no term limits. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3320.4s)]
*  I think it was like an unspoken thing. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3321.4s)]
*  Like you just generally didn't do it. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3322.4s)]
*  Yeah, cause George. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3323.4s)]
*  Washington stepped down. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3324.4s)]
*  So he did too. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3325.4s)]
*  So everybody's like. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3326.4s)]
*  You're right. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3327.4s)]
*  That's what I call George W. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3328.4s)]
*  So he did too, therefore other people can do too. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3329.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3333.4s)]
*  And he didn't, I think he intentionally didn't run a third time. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3334.4s)]
*  How much fun was having slaves that he was like, I'm tired of this. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3337.4s)]
*  I'm not seeing the correlation. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3341.4s)]
*  I'm sure it wasn't boring. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3342.4s)]
*  He left the presidency to go own his slaves again. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3343.4s)]
*  But he can do both. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3344.4s)]
*  No, he couldn't. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3345.4s)]
*  If you're president, you just kind of all, you just have slaves everywhere. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3346.4s)]
*  No, you couldn't. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3347.4s)]
*  He couldn't do it the way he wanted to. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3348.4s)]
*  He couldn't do it the way he wanted. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3349.4s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3350.4s)]
*  George Washington. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3351.4s)]
*  George Washington. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3352.4s)]

*  He's like, no, I'm not going to do that. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3360.4s)]
*  He wanted, no, no, no, no, no, George Washington. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3363.4s)]
*  George Washington. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3365.4s)]
*  George Washington. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3366.4s)]
*  Like he had to be in there signing documents all fucking day and he's looking at the field. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3367.4s)]
*  He's like, no, I'm not going to do that. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3370.4s)]

*  Fuck. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3376.4s)]
*  Apparently that's why George Washington left. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3377.4s)]
*  The target guy is like, yeah, he's like a huge land speculator, had so much money. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3380.4s)]
*  He's like the wealthiest guy when he left presidency to this day. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3384.4s)]
*  He's like the richest president. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3386.4s)]
*  Okay, so when I said it, oh, there's no correlation. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3387.4s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3390.4s)]
*  And then when Mark says land speculation and all these other things. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3391.4s)]

*  And when a real hardworking blue collar American like me comes along. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3407.4s)]
*  Blue collar. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3411.4s)]

*  Bidet. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3414.4s)]
*  Yeah, because that's a gay thing to do. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3415.4s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not going to have something shooting in my ass. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3417.4s)]
*  It's the most blue collar, dude. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3419.4s)]
*  What is going on with you? [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3421.4s)]
*  I'm just saying you can't install anything in your life. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3423.4s)]
*  You're so far from blue collar. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3425.4s)]
*  I just acknowledge that was a horrible way to prove your point. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3427.4s)]
*  For example. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3429.4s)]
*  I stand by my point. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3430.4s)]
*  For example. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3434.4s)]
*  I could have gone with a better thing you couldn't have done. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3435.4s)]
*  Build a shelf for example. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3437.4s)]
*  Build a shelf would have been a better thing. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3439.4s)]
*  Change the oil in your car. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3441.4s)]
*  Change the oil. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3442.4s)]

*  Change the front tires. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3446.4s)]
*  There's a lot of things I just grabbed the first thing in my ass. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3447.4s)]
*  You can't even put foam on a macchiato. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3449.4s)]
*  You call yourself blue collar? [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3451.4s)]
*  You can't assemble a charcuterie. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3455.4s)]
*  What about you with blue collar at all? [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3456.4s)]
*  Yo, I got just so fucking rich it's unbelievable. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3458.4s)]

*  What a rich fucking guy you are. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3464.4s)]
*  A lot of Indians came out for Trump. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3465.4s)]
*  Do you think you had anything to do with it? [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3467.4s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3468.4s)]
*  I'm a hero over there. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3469.4s)]
*  You're a glowing endorsement, I think. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3470.4s)]
*  I'm a hero over there. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3472.4s)]
*  What did Modi say? [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3473.4s)]
*  Modi said, I'm going to be so angry. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3474.4s)]
*  That was the most non-racist Indian accent I've ever heard in my life. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3478.4s)]
*  It was Japanese. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3482.4s)]
*  That was funny. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3483.4s)]
*  Nobody caught on to that. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3484.4s)]
*  Nobody caught on to that. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3486.4s)]
*  He did a Japanese. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3487.4s)]
*  He goes, I will handle it. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3489.4s)]
*  And we just sat there pretending that he wasn't doing a Japanese accent. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3493.4s)]
*  He might not know that Modi's not Japanese. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3497.4s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3500.4s)]
*  Yeah, he's Asian. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3501.4s)]
*  Facts. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3502.4s)]
*  Okay, so we hope that Elon is involved. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3503.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3506.4s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3507.4s)]
*  It is interesting that... [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3509.4s)]
*  It worries me a little bit. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3511.4s)]
*  Well, okay, I want to hear that perspective. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3513.4s)]
*  Just because of how quick he is with his cuts. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3515.4s)]
*  In a private sector, cool. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3519.4s)]
*  But with the government, it's too many ramifications. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3521.4s)]
*  Real quick, real quick. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3525.4s)]
*  So what he said was, I thought quite interesting. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3526.4s)]
*  He was like, we have to take care of these people. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3529.4s)]
*  So I think what we should do is pay them two years of salary the day that we fire them. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3532.4s)]
*  We don't want people to leave and then be homeless. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3536.4s)]
*  We don't want people to leave and hurt. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3539.4s)]
*  These are people and families. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3541.4s)]
*  So he's like, let's pay them the two years of salary upfront. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3542.4s)]
*  And then they'll have two years to figure out the next thing they're going to do with their life. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3545.4s)]
*  And these are people who obviously can hold a job. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3549.4s)]
*  These are people who obviously are proficient at something. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3552.4s)]
*  So they'll go help America in other ways and hold positions in other ways. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3554.4s)]
*  But at least we won't be kicking them out the door and then they're on their ass. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3557.4s)]
*  But then also the way he's two years a little fucking crazy. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3560.4s)]
*  Two years, you get all fucking midterm to figure out what you want to do. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3563.4s)]
*  That's nuts. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3567.4s)]
*  You leave my office right now. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3568.4s)]
*  A year is more than enough. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3570.4s)]
*  So whatever they end up coming to, at least what I was saying is when he said that, I was like, OK, at least there's some compassion here. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3572.4s)]
*  Because I was concerned about that, too. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3577.4s)]
*  You have a friend who has a job that he's working for the government. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3578.4s)]
*  And a lot of people you remember this like when you get a job working for the government, there is there's this feeling like, OK, as long as I stick in this job for 25, 30 years, [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3581.4s)]
*  I'll be safe. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3589.4s)]
*  I'll have my what is it called? [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3590.4s)]
*  Pension. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3592.4s)]
*  And like I'll be able to like retire and take care of my family. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3593.4s)]
*  You rich fucks don't even know. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3596.4s)]
*  We're not rich fucks. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3598.4s)]
*  We've never had one of them jobs. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3599.4s)]
*  I never had a job where you get two years paid like paid severance. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3601.4s)]
*  So it's two years is a lot. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3604.4s)]
*  Have some compassion. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3606.4s)]
*  Two years is insane. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3607.4s)]
*  A year is honestly too much for you to have. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3610.4s)]
*  Akash is so fucking funny. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3612.4s)]
*  I know. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3614.4s)]

*  And he's like, yo. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3617.4s)]
*  No, he was poor. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3618.4s)]
*  He was almost. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3619.4s)]
*  He used to go to one of his government jobs. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3620.4s)]
*  You asked about a government job. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3621.4s)]
*  All right, guys, we're going to take a break real quick because we got to talk about Morgan & Morgan. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3623.4s)]

*  You know, it's easy, though. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3643.4s)]
*  It's submitting a claim on Morgan & Morgan. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3644.4s)]
*  You know, Morgan & Morgan is America's largest insurance company. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3646.4s)]
*  It's America's largest injury law firm with over 100 offices nationwide and over 800 lawyers. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3647.4s)]

*  Okay, never mind. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3945.4s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3946.4s)]
*  Not, not, ask your ass. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3947.2400000000002s)]
*  You brought it up, I'm just asking. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3948.08s)]
*  What's your question? [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3950.08s)]
*  What's your question about what? [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3950.9s)]
*  Because you see how Twitter is right now. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3951.88s)]
*  I know it's coming. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3954.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, how's Twitter right now? [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3955.2400000000002s)]
*  Like all the fucking anti-Semitism shit that you see. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3956.56s)]
*  Anti-Semitism. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3958.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3959.76s)]
*  Shit. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3960.56s)]
*  There's stalactites. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3961.36s)]
*  Miles, don't start. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3963.64s)]
*  Miles, don't start. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3964.88s)]
*  I'll send it in your direction right now. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3966.12s)]
*  Hey, it's Miles, American dog. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3967.64s)]
*  And I'll send it. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3968.7200000000003s)]
*  Yo, Miles. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3969.52s)]
*  You do whatever you want to do over there. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3970.32s)]
*  Miles, so happy. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3972.48s)]
*  Miles texted me, man, lady's like, damn, we losing, right? [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3973.64s)]
*  And he just goes, wrong text. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3977.36s)]
*  All right. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3979.7200000000003s)]
*  You know, you were saying, what, there's a lot of anti-Semitism? [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3983.52s)]
*  I give up. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3985.52s)]
*  There's a lot of anti-Semitism on Twitter. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3986.32s)]
*  Are you concerned about racism or anti-Semitism? [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3988.32s)]
*  No, Elon, the way he slashes jobs. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3990.32s)]
*  Like, he doesn't do it strategically. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3992.52s)]
*  He's just like. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3994.52s)]
*  What about anti-Semitism? [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3995.32s)]
*  Yeah, what does that have to do with? [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3996.36s)]
*  He broke Twitter in a way that Twitter's kind of wild now. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=3997.6400000000003s)]
*  Like, it's a little, it's not as. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4000.88s)]
*  That's what you're saying. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4002.36s)]
*  Twitter is wild, and that is the cost of free speech. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4003.1600000000003s)]
*  And I think what's happening right now is basically people [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4005.56s)]
*  are so like, you get a new car, right? [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4008.0s)]
*  You get a Ferrari, you want to drive as fast as it can go. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4011.24s)]
*  That's what people are doing with free speech. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4013.6s)]
*  Ideally, what happens is in the next year, two years, [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4015.36s)]
*  people start going, oh, you don't need to drive the car [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4019.48s)]
*  as fast every single time. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4023.88s)]
*  And I think this would happen when, like, [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4026.36s)]
*  Sirius XM came around, remember? [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4027.88s)]
*  Like, and you could curse on Sirius XM, [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4029.52s)]
*  and everybody was cursing. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4031.7999999999997s)]
*  And then people started to realize, like, oh, [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4033.2s)]
*  it doesn't make it better that you can curse. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4034.44s)]
*  You know, eventually you actually have to say things [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4036.84s)]
*  that are like thoughtful and interesting. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4039.32s)]
*  So right now it's working that you could just be, [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4040.52s)]
*  you know, super racist or super anti-Semitic [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4043.12s)]
*  or super hateful. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4045.52s)]
*  And I think eventually it just kind of calms down. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4046.96s)]
*  That's my suspicion. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4049.08s)]
*  Part of the reason is because he slashed jobs by so much, [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4050.04s)]
*  and so some of the people that were like, [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4052.96s)]
*  would tame down that noise are no longer there. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4055.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't believe that. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4058.0s)]
*  I believe that he's committed to free speech, [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4058.84s)]
*  and unfortunately free speech protects hate speech. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4060.44s)]
*  I think it's 70% drop in. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4063.0800000000004s)]
*  No, because- [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4066.5600000000004s)]
*  I don't believe he's as altruistic [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4067.4s)]
*  as a lot of the right beliefs. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4068.36s)]
*  I do believe there's some, [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4069.6400000000003s)]
*  he definitely wanted Trump to get elected. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4071.1600000000003s)]
*  He had his reasons. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4072.6800000000003s)]
*  I wonder if it's, [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4073.76s)]
*  because JD Vance seems to be in Big Tech's pocket. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4075.0s)]
*  Like, Peter Thiel funded his whole presidential thing. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4077.28s)]
*  I wonder if they're like, we can control that guy. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4080.1200000000003s)]
*  That's one step away from Trump. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4082.5600000000004s)]
*  Let's get Trump elected. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4083.88s)]
*  You trust him, JD Vance? [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4084.96s)]
*  I do not. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4086.8s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4089.0800000000004s)]
*  To do what he did in his life- [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4090.36s)]
*  He's nice. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4091.2000000000003s)]
*  He's nice, but I don't- [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4092.04s)]
*  Like, the guy, his mom was a drug addict, right? [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4093.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4095.32s)]
*  Poor, ends up going to Yale, [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4096.72s)]
*  navigating Yale with really nothing to offer. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4100.36s)]
*  Remember, a lot of people that go to these [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4104.44s)]
*  elite private schools, like, [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4105.72s)]
*  their legacies, individuals, [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4107.24s)]
*  and the people at these schools, [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4110.5199999999995s)]
*  a lot of them are entering banking, [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4111.64s)]
*  and, or some sort of like VC hedge fund world, [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4113.64s)]
*  where having wealthy family members is very valuable [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4118.04s)]
*  because you can use them as assets for investment, [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4121.24s)]
*  whatever these companies are. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4124.5199999999995s)]
*  Navigating that world with really nothing [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4125.5199999999995s)]
*  to offer those people takes super high [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4127.08s)]
*  emotional intelligence. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4129.2s)]
*  This guy's smart. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4131.28s)]
*  No question. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4133.8s)]
*  I don't know how much I trust him. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4134.679999999999s)]
*  That's exactly how I feel. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4136.679999999999s)]
*  He's nice. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4137.679999999999s)]
*  In that debate, he was nice. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4138.5199999999995s)]
*  He's nice. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4139.5199999999995s)]
*  He's a shark, dog. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4140.36s)]
*  But I need to sit in a room with him, [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4141.2s)]
*  and I need to be like, [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4143.12s)]
*  and they asked him, they asked us to have him on, [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4145.16s)]
*  and my feeling was if we had him on, [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4148.2s)]
*  but we didn't have anybody from the Democrats side on, [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4151.28s)]
*  it would seem too unfair. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4156.16s)]
*  Like, I thought we were more or less balanced. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4158.0s)]
*  We had Cuban on, and then we had Trump on. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4159.48s)]
*  We tried to get someone else, [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4161.36s)]
*  tried to get Buttigieg on. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4162.84s)]
*  He's supposed to come on, [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4164.16s)]
*  then he has to do debate prep. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4165.0s)]
*  Maybe that's an excuse, or maybe not, but. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4166.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4168.72s)]
*  I just felt like it would be too one-sided. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4169.5599999999995s)]
*  But I do, in order to know if I can trust him, [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4172.08s)]
*  I gotta sit in a room with him. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4173.76s)]
*  That is, to do what he did in his life is- [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4174.599999999999s)]
*  I don't question his ability. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4177.16s)]
*  Is very difficult. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4178.4s)]
*  I don't question his ability. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4179.24s)]
*  I question a little bit his motives [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4180.08s)]
*  and how he operates. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4181.8s)]
*  Four years, he's next up. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4183.44s)]
*  And think about it, talk crazy shit about Trump. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4185.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's the wildest shit. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4188.72s)]
*  Well, to me, this is also evidence, [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4190.32s)]
*  people go, oh, Trump's about to go after all the people [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4192.08s)]
*  that hate him on him. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4194.36s)]
*  It's like, I don't think that's really how he operates. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4195.2s)]
*  If those people take a step in his direction, [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4197.44s)]
*  he's fine. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4202.64s)]
*  Vince McMahon. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4203.72s)]
*  So if they continue to hate on him, [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4205.56s)]
*  then they might be fucked. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4208.0s)]
*  But if they try to be diplomatic, [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4209.120000000001s)]
*  and they try to work with him and do things, [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4211.240000000001s)]
*  clearly he will forgive. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4213.360000000001s)]
*  He forgot, the VP is the guy who hated him [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4214.6s)]
*  more than anything, said vile things about him. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4217.4400000000005s)]
*  Now he made him VP, next in line to rule the country. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4219.56s)]
*  Could that also show how easily manipulative, [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4222.200000000001s)]
*  I mean, how easy he can be manipulated? [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4225.88s)]
*  I think that's one way of looking at the argument. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4228.080000000001s)]
*  And it's just the same coin, right? [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4230.320000000001s)]
*  One side is always easily tricked or manipulated. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4232.160000000001s)]
*  The other side is, he looks at it as business, [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4234.32s)]
*  or he looks at it as the game, he looks at it as politics. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4237.24s)]
*  And once you're willing to get on board, [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4240.36s)]
*  if you're willing to help the agenda, [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4242.32s)]
*  and you can help the agenda, [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4243.8s)]
*  doesn't matter what you said, let's go make this work. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4245.16s)]
*  Probably a little bit of both. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4247.5199999999995s)]
*  So it could be, yeah. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4248.639999999999s)]
*  Are things culturally more annoying now with Trump? [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4250.36s)]
*  Oh, break that down, that's an interesting one. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4253.28s)]
*  Like, from 2016 to 2020, it just seemed like every day [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4254.96s)]
*  there was like a culture war happening, [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4258.639999999999s)]
*  he would tweet some shit, and then people would dissect it, [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4260.0s)]
*  and there'd be back and forth, [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4262.36s)]
*  and if you said something, like specifically on stage, [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4263.32s)]
*  and you'd be like, I think this, people would be like, [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4265.719999999999s)]
*  wait, are you a Trump guy, are you not, da da da? [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4267.36s)]
*  Is that a redo? [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4269.2s)]
*  I agree with you. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4270.4s)]
*  It's over. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4271.24s)]
*  It's not a redo, it's an over, it's a unanimous victory, [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4272.08s)]
*  people are exhausted. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4275.0s)]
*  I actually think him losing in 2020 [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4276.24s)]
*  is the best thing that could have happened, [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4278.04s)]
*  because America clearly wasn't ready to reject [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4280.04s)]
*  the path that was going on. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4284.5599999999995s)]
*  And the 2024 victory is America unanimously going, [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4286.36s)]
*  okay, we don't like what the Democrats are offering, [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4290.68s)]
*  we actually don't even trust the way [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4294.4400000000005s)]
*  that they're positioning Trump to be. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4296.88s)]
*  Like, yeah, there might be some issues, [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4299.12s)]
*  but it's not as bad as the Democrats are making it. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4300.68s)]
*  I mean, like seeing Obama on there, like, on the trail, [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4303.280000000001s)]
*  and this was like heartbreaking a little bit, [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4307.320000000001s)]
*  like him spouting hoaxes, like he's on the campaign trail, [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4308.64s)]
*  like he's saying things that have been debunked [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4314.56s)]
*  and proven false. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4316.64s)]
*  Like what? [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4317.4800000000005s)]
*  Like there's good people on both sides thing. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4318.32s)]
*  Like there's all these things that, [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4320.639999999999s)]
*  and it's just like even Obama, like Obama, like this is, [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4323.12s)]
*  maybe I hold him to a higher regard than I should. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4328.04s)]
*  They're all politicians at the end of the day. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4330.96s)]
*  Yeah, I know I should about that. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4331.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4332.92s)]
*  I did hear the full part of what Trump said, [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4333.759999999999s)]
*  but if you're at a rally and there's KKK [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4336.96s)]
*  and white nationalists right next to you, [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4340.799999999999s)]
*  are there good people on both sides? [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4343.32s)]
*  If you're rolling with these people, [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4346.4s)]
*  I think you're going to be able to see [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4349.08s)]
*  that there's good people on both sides. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4350.2s)]
*  So the context of this conversation [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4351.92s)]
*  is the Charlottesville thing. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4353.639999999999s)]
*  And like there were people that don't want to tear down [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4355.28s)]
*  all the statues and the people that do want to tear down [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4357.5599999999995s)]
*  the statues. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4359.8s)]
*  And I think his argument that like there's good reasons [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4360.639999999999s)]
*  to want to tear it down and there's good reasons [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4363.76s)]
*  to maybe not want to tear them down. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4365.5199999999995s)]
*  Like we start looking into the morality of all these people [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4366.84s)]
*  that we have statues of, good or bad, [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4370.44s)]
*  all of a sudden they're going to start coming down. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4373.48s)]
*  Like George Washington had slaves. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4375.0s)]
*  And I think that's the kind of thing [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4378.12s)]
*  that we're looking for. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4379.360000000001s)]
*  We're looking for something, [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4380.400000000001s)]
*  even though maybe the cause is moral, [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4381.56s)]
*  just whatever the case is. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4384.4800000000005s)]
*  But right next to you is KKK, it's white nationals. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4385.56s)]
*  Are you really on the right side? [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4389.08s)]
*  I understand your positioning 100%. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4390.280000000001s)]
*  The unfortunate thing is sometimes your views [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4393.4800000000005s)]
*  align with people whose views are abhorrent. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4399.200000000001s)]
*  So for example, KKK people might want smaller government. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4403.280000000001s)]
*  That doesn't mean you support KKK shit. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4407.68s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just saying if there's a march [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4409.84s)]
*  for smaller government and KKK shows up [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4412.64s)]
*  and be like, I'm gonna sit that one out. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4415.0s)]
*  Yeah, he could have said nothing. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4417.8s)]
*  But it's like if you're in a free speech debate, [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4419.96s)]
*  you're like, look, I see both sides. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4421.32s)]
*  But that doesn't mean I'm like endorsing the people [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4423.0s)]
*  that are pro Hitler. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4425.2s)]
*  Well, I do think Trump will, he doesn't want to lose ever. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4426.24s)]
*  So he will co-sign some shit that he shouldn't co-sign [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4429.5599999999995s)]
*  if he knows those guys are going to vote for him [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4432.96s)]
*  and he doesn't want to, and if he doesn't, [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4434.32s)]
*  then he's going to lose their vote. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4435.72s)]
*  And then he'll figure out whoever's outraged on the back end. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4437.88s)]
*  But let me just not lose their vote. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4439.96s)]
*  And I don't like that, I don't. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4441.2s)]
*  I would say also to your initial point, [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4444.08s)]
*  I think being comedians, we're in making the jokes, [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4446.56s)]
*  whatever, the height of the cancel culture shit [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4450.24s)]
*  was like 2015, 2016. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4452.76s)]
*  I think Trump getting elected the first time [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4455.0s)]
*  was the beginning of the downward, we're done with this. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4456.64s)]
*  And I think 2016 when he won, everybody's like, [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4459.28s)]
*  but he lost to popular. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4462.12s)]
*  So you still felt emboldened [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4463.32s)]
*  that the majority of the country is with me. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4464.52s)]
*  Now this is such a decisive victory. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4466.0s)]
*  Trump won the popular. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4468.0s)]
*  I do think people in the middle have to start looking like, [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4469.04s)]
*  oh, these leftists don't got it. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4472.16s)]
*  They act like they got it, they don't got it. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4473.52s)]
*  And they're going to believe what they're going to believe [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4475.08s)]
*  because they're retards as are people in the far right. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4476.16s)]
*  But like, it's over. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4478.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's just a rejection of like actors as influencers. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4480.2s)]
*  Actors and musicians don't move the needle. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4486.12s)]
*  No. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4489.4s)]
*  And a lot of that comes from the connection thing [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4490.24s)]
*  we were talking about earlier. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4492.8s)]
*  It's like, as famous as actors are, [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4493.64s)]
*  we don't really feel connected to them. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4495.68s)]
*  Like I'm not as cool as fucking George Clooney is, [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4497.12s)]
*  he's the coolest guy on the fucking planet. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4499.56s)]
*  You know, Ocean's 11, 12, 13. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4501.160000000001s)]
*  I'm like, I just want to exist in those movies. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4502.52s)]
*  But I'm not connected to him like I am [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4505.200000000001s)]
*  like a guy like Joe Rogan. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4506.92s)]
*  So Joe Rogan could influence me [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4508.04s)]
*  way more than a George Clooney. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4509.4800000000005s)]
*  And I think that that exists even at the highest level [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4511.280000000001s)]
*  like a Taylor Swift. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4514.280000000001s)]
*  We have an idea of who Taylor is, [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4517.4400000000005s)]
*  but I don't know if she connects with us [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4520.240000000001s)]
*  on a day to day basis like a podcaster does. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4524.24s)]
*  Or to be fair, like radio hosts did back in the day, [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4528.48s)]
*  like a Howard Stern probably had way more influence. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4532.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4535.24s)]
*  I mean, I think evidence of that is like the T-Nos coming out. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4536.08s)]
*  What's that? [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4538.2s)]
*  Like Latinos came out and like big numbers for- [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4539.04s)]
*  Huge numbers for Trump. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4540.84s)]
*  Yeah, and like, I think that was like [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4541.719999999999s)]
*  the biggest disparity from 2020. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4542.88s)]
*  I think it was like 25 or 30 points more Latinos, [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4544.92s)]
*  even in like swing states like PA and shit. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4548.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4550.32s)]
*  So even on the heels of like Tony's joke, [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4551.16s)]
*  and people were like, [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4553.48s)]
*  oh, this is gonna swing the election, da da da. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4554.32s)]
*  That seems like it had no effect. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4555.919999999999s)]
*  No effect. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4557.24s)]
*  And Latinos were still like, no, we like Trump. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4558.08s)]
*  And that's again in the face of the cancel culture thing. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4559.4s)]
*  It's like, that was one thing I did get right. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4561.24s)]
*  We talked about it on the Patreon. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4563.2s)]
*  I was like, I don't think this joke hurts Trump [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4564.5599999999995s)]
*  or Tony at all. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4566.28s)]
*  I don't think it fucking matters. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4567.5199999999995s)]
*  They're both gonna be fine. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4569.08s)]
*  Cause it's just a joke. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4570.44s)]
*  And again, to the cancel culture thing, [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4571.339999999999s)]
*  we're not buying into that shit anymore. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4572.719999999999s)]
*  I had an interesting take about that [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4575.5599999999995s)]
*  from Gnome from the Comedy Cellar. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4578.759999999999s)]
*  And he basically said like, [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4580.919999999999s)]
*  the fact that they didn't vet the jokes [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4582.24s)]
*  is indicative of them not caring about comedy [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4587.36s)]
*  being like dangerous. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4597.8s)]
*  Them not taking, yeah, dangerous. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4600.5599999999995s)]
*  Like in a positive way, meaning like they're like, [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4602.28s)]
*  we're not gonna be the administration [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4605.08s)]
*  that like censors jokes. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4606.599999999999s)]
*  Like they're just jokes. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4608.599999999999s)]
*  Why would we waste time looking over your jokes? [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4609.88s)]
*  We don't need to do that. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4612.8s)]
*  You're a comedian and you just do it. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4614.36s)]
*  Now that might be a very gracious way of looking at it. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4615.76s)]
*  But I thought it was a kind of interesting take. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4618.4400000000005s)]
*  Like I imagine the Democrats are like, [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4620.400000000001s)]
*  well, we need to see every single word [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4622.64s)]
*  and see every single joke. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4624.04s)]
*  And they're like, we're not gonna police your fucking jokes. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4624.88s)]
*  That's not what our organization is doing. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4626.8s)]
*  That's not what our administration is gonna do. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4628.56s)]
*  That was an interesting take. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4630.84s)]
*  It's more one of those things that like I wanna believe. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4632.16s)]
*  I don't know if it's actually real, but yeah. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4634.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4638.8s)]
*  Yeah, Tony's vindicated though. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4639.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4641.12s)]
*  Tony is free. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4641.96s)]
*  He was watching that shit nervously, bro. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4644.400000000001s)]
*  Bro, calm him. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4646.88s)]
*  Stay out of Spanish Harlem. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4648.360000000001s)]
*  Puerto Ricans, they might still be upset. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4650.96s)]
*  By the way, Tony. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4652.84s)]
*  It's actually, he picked the perfect group [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4655.8s)]
*  because most Latinos don't like Puerto Ricans. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4657.76s)]
*  So that's the thing. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4659.84s)]
*  That's the thing. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4661.56s)]
*  It's like all these white people coming out like, [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4662.400000000001s)]
*  yo, Puerto Rico is not garbage, [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4664.64s)]
*  but all these Latinos were like, [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4666.4s)]
*  yo, sometimes you get it right. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4668.08s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4669.599999999999s)]
*  Sometimes jokes are true. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4670.44s)]
*  That's why it's funny. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4673.0s)]
*  Did you guys talk about it on the Patreon, [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4678.36s)]
*  the Tony Hinchcliffe joke? [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4679.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it just wasn't, yeah. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4681.12s)]
*  We basically said the environment wasn't conducive [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4682.16s)]
*  to doing these jokes. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4684.04s)]
*  Also, the jokes just didn't make sense. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4685.2s)]
*  And I think like, jumps. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4688.36s)]
*  For New Yorkers is what I'm saying. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4690.16s)]
*  Like New Yorkers, we think of Puerto Rico [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4691.48s)]
*  as this like tropical, beautiful island. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4693.4s)]
*  It's not viewed as like a garbage island. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4696.08s)]
*  That's a great point. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4698.320000000001s)]
*  So that's why the audience was like, huh? [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4699.16s)]
*  That's weird. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4700.64s)]
*  Because it's like our first trip [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4701.4800000000005s)]
*  to a tropical, beautiful place in our lives. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4702.8s)]
*  So the punchline didn't make sense, [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4705.4800000000005s)]
*  and that's why I didn't land in the room. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4707.12s)]
*  There are maybe places that you could use [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4710.64s)]
*  that would have worked for the joke, for sure. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4713.8s)]
*  But I think the takeaway now is just, [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4716.52s)]
*  yeah, he's a comedian, he's a rose comedian. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4718.8s)]
*  Like Jon Stewart, the best, you know, [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4720.4400000000005s)]
*  pats off to Jon Stewart [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4722.72s)]
*  because he took that shit on the chin. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4723.72s)]
*  He went immediately, hey, he's a rose comedian, [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4725.84s)]
*  he's hilarious, this is what they do. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4728.28s)]
*  Maybe the administration shouldn't have brought him [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4730.2s)]
*  up there to do it because that's what he does. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4732.04s)]
*  But we're not gonna get upset at the guy [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4734.08s)]
*  for doing the thing he does. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4735.4s)]
*  And for him, knowing the base that he's built [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4737.04s)]
*  and the trust that they have in him, [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4740.8s)]
*  to come out there and say that first, [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4742.2s)]
*  I think that took a lot of the heat off of. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4744.04s)]
*  He's the best. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4746.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4746.92s)]
*  So what happens now? [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4747.76s)]
*  What does the media do? [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4749.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't think the media can sit back and go, [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4752.599999999999s)]
*  we don't have the influence that we had before, [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4755.2s)]
*  and we have to change all our programs, [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4758.16s)]
*  and we have to make everything long form [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4759.92s)]
*  where you can really get to know somebody. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4762.88s)]
*  It just doesn't match the goal of legacy media, [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4764.52s)]
*  which is to sell pharmaceuticals, [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4769.240000000001s)]
*  or to sell Bud Lights, or whatever the fuck they, [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4770.88s)]
*  the reason why there are all these shows. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4774.12s)]
*  So I think the only thing they can do is deny [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4775.280000000001s)]
*  that they have a lack of influence, [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4779.2s)]
*  and then make radioactive the opposition. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4781.2s)]
*  Yeah, same play. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4784.96s)]
*  The same play, always. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4786.639999999999s)]
*  So it's just like, you're racist, you're blah blah blah, [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4787.5599999999995s)]
*  like you're sexist, you're a bad person. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4791.44s)]
*  All the, like I would not be surprised [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4793.96s)]
*  if there are articles about us and the other podcasts [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4795.76s)]
*  that were successful in this time, [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4800.12s)]
*  that are not supportive and congratulatory. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4802.92s)]
*  I wouldn't see articles, wow, they built up a community, [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4807.84s)]
*  and they were able to have a conversation [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4810.5199999999995s)]
*  that was really unique. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4813.12s)]
*  They'll leave out that we asked common multiple times [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4813.96s)]
*  to come on. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4816.28s)]
*  Of course, of course, and they'll probably try to [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4817.12s)]
*  make us as toxic as possible by bringing up everything [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4820.28s)]
*  that we may be tangentially accused of [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4823.599999999999s)]
*  throughout our careers, [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4827.28s)]
*  and not mentioning anything successful that we've done [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4828.679999999999s)]
*  throughout our careers. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4832.719999999999s)]
*  So, because that's the only thing that they can do [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4833.719999999999s)]
*  to maintain their status quo. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4836.599999999999s)]
*  Which is a badge of honor, kind of. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4839.88s)]
*  It's a badge of honor, but I think it's important [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4841.24s)]
*  to talk about these things. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4842.96s)]
*  Like, one thing I'll give Trump credit for [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4844.6s)]
*  is his calling out the media created protection for him. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4848.32s)]
*  Because the media online, new media, old media, [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4854.8s)]
*  can create narratives that are just not true. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4858.2s)]
*  And you have to decide, you're like, should I address this? [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4860.68s)]
*  Should I just ignore it? [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4863.4s)]
*  And a lot of times you don't wanna address it [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4865.0s)]
*  because you don't wanna put more heat on it, [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4866.28s)]
*  but there's a version where if you address it, [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4868.16s)]
*  then all of a sudden your fans start to go, [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4871.5199999999995s)]
*  oh, this is bullshit, this is made up, this is not true. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4873.0s)]
*  And then they stop believing what was going on. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4876.24s)]
*  Yeah, so it's just one of those things where I wonder, [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4883.5599999999995s)]
*  our take is if you're not really a real resource [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4886.44s)]
*  that's not getting a lot of views, it doesn't really matter, [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4891.12s)]
*  we just kind of ignore it. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4893.12s)]
*  But maybe there's a version where we should be [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4894.76s)]
*  addressing more things. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4896.5599999999995s)]
*  I figure people are eventually gonna see it [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4898.599999999999s)]
*  and then they stop trusting the outlets [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4900.44s)]
*  that just lie for views. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4902.12s)]
*  But maybe that's not the case. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4903.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I just feel like I saw a turn with Rogan. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4905.64s)]
*  Once all the COVID stuff was happening, [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4907.8s)]
*  he was kind of talking out against it [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4909.76s)]
*  and then they're using his images with color correction [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4910.88s)]
*  to make him look worse on CNN. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4913.44s)]
*  And then the way that they've slandered him [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4915.5599999999995s)]
*  after he became vocal about that issue, [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4917.28s)]
*  I think more and more people were like, [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4920.28s)]
*  wait, this guy, lifelong liberal, [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4921.4s)]
*  like endorsed Bernie more or less, [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4923.16s)]
*  was supportive of Bernie. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4925.92s)]
*  And now you're calling him all these names and slurs, [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4927.5199999999995s)]
*  it's like, all right. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4929.959999999999s)]
*  And I think that is a moment where a lot of people go like, [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4930.879999999999s)]
*  oh, they're just calling everyone they don't like a Nazi. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4932.959999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and I think we should pay attention [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4935.16s)]
*  to who these creators are, who the writers are, [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4937.5199999999995s)]
*  and see if there's a pattern. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4942.0s)]
*  See if there's a pattern of these types of pieces [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4945.08s)]
*  being written, see if that's essentially what they do. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4947.36s)]
*  Yeah, oh yeah. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4951.5599999999995s)]
*  Right, in the same way that they'll try to create patterns [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4953.08s)]
*  for us and they'll try to create narratives about us, [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4956.0s)]
*  I imagine that if we look back at the pieces that they make, [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4958.56s)]
*  there will be some patterns that they might not like out there [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4961.48s)]
*  and it might undermine their journalistic integrity. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4964.56s)]
*  So it's something that we should look at, [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4969.16s)]
*  like as we go into this new media landscape, [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4970.44s)]
*  it's up to us also have integrity, [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4973.04s)]
*  which I think we did, especially during the election. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4975.08s)]
*  Like we could have been so biased in one direction, [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4977.2s)]
*  we had everybody on the right was willing [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4980.52s)]
*  to come on the show. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4982.48s)]
*  And we're like, if we do that, it will just be too biased. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4983.72s)]
*  And we're not gonna give our audience [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4986.88s)]
*  a true understanding of what this political landscape is [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4989.2s)]
*  so that they can make a decision that they believe. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4991.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4993.96s)]
*  It is interesting to see Bezos not endorse Kamala [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4994.8s)]
*  through Washington Post. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4998.4400000000005s)]
*  And then also Zuckerberg kind of at the same time being like, [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=4999.88s)]
*  oh yeah, the Biden administration is trying to get us [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5002.4800000000005s)]
*  to squash all these stories. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5004.64s)]
*  Yeah, that was well. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5005.96s)]
*  Like all these large tech guys, all simultaneously. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5006.88s)]
*  That is also what makes me a little more wary [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5009.320000000001s)]
*  of JD Vance though. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5011.240000000001s)]
*  And I don't look at that as much as an admonishment [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5012.32s)]
*  of the Biden administration as I do. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5016.16s)]
*  It was a little worrying that all these massive [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5018.639999999999s)]
*  like technocrats or whatever are suddenly all kind [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5020.719999999999s)]
*  of shifting this way. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5023.799999999999s)]
*  And it could just be they're unhappy. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5025.2s)]
*  But I also, I'm like, oh, your vice president [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5026.599999999999s)]
*  is funded by a technocrat. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5028.679999999999s)]
*  This seems a little convenient, the timing. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5030.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but also like Pence would not was funded, [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5032.96s)]
*  but like was largely influenced by like [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5035.32s)]
*  the evangelical right. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5036.92s)]
*  And I don't feel like that played like a huge effect [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5037.88s)]
*  on Trump outside of the room. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5040.04s)]
*  And they don't fear their influence. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5041.04s)]
*  That was huge. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5042.08s)]
*  Yeah, but like, I mean, it didn't stop necessarily [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5043.04s)]
*  like Pence, you know, like Pence wasn't just [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5045.16s)]
*  like lap dogging on Trump, you know what I mean? [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5048.16s)]
*  Like there's still like friction between them. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5049.76s)]
*  And so in the same way, I wonder how much JD [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5052.36s)]
*  can actually even influence Trump. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5054.4400000000005s)]
*  This is not my conspiracy, [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5055.84s)]
*  but if we're getting real conspiratorial. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5056.96s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5059.0s)]
*  These guys are powerful enough to be like, [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5060.6s)]
*  yo, let's just get Trump out of there [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5061.88s)]
*  and let's get our guy. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5063.04s)]
*  He's VP now. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5064.4400000000005s)]
*  We couldn't have got him elected. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5065.4400000000005s)]
*  We can make him president now. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5066.92s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5069.24s)]
*  I don't know if I should give credit to whoever, [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5070.24s)]
*  but like, yeah, that's not, [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5071.2s)]
*  but it didn't seem completely impossible when he said it. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5072.4s)]
*  I think that all of these people are hedging. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5076.92s)]
*  And I think Bezos is hedging. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5081.32s)]
*  Bezos didn't endorse Trump. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5083.48s)]
*  He just said, I'm not gonna endorse any of them. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5085.16s)]
*  And by not endorsing through the Washington Post [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5087.32s)]
*  is what we're talking about. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5089.92s)]
*  He left it open for interpretation. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5092.24s)]
*  And now he can go to Trump and be like, [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5094.44s)]
*  okay listen, there's certain government contracts [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5096.76s)]
*  I would like to continue. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5099.0s)]
*  Jeff Bezos got really favorable government contracts [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5100.4800000000005s)]
*  for his space program. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5103.32s)]
*  Elon is best buddies with Trump. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5105.76s)]
*  I can't fathom that Trump is going to side with Bezos [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5107.96s)]
*  over Elon for any type of government funded [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5112.24s)]
*  space exploration. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5117.16s)]
*  But maybe, and I imagine when you get to that level [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5119.68s)]
*  of business, you need government influence. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5122.8s)]
*  And maybe he's doing this just to protect his interests. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5125.4400000000005s)]
*  That's a weird thing that newspapers [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5128.76s)]
*  actually endorse any kind of. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5130.84s)]
*  Insane, right? [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5132.360000000001s)]
*  That shit makes no sense. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5133.2s)]
*  It's supposed to be an unbiased journalistic paper. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5135.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5137.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's weird in itself. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5138.6s)]
*  So I actually liked the fact that they didn't. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5139.72s)]
*  None of them should. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5141.2s)]
*  Let us read your articles. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5142.04s)]
*  And by reading your articles, we come to a decision. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5143.4400000000005s)]
*  You don't have to tell us what to do. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5146.04s)]
*  None of us told you. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5148.2s)]

*  Did she take the stand? [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5192.28s)]
*  I thought she didn't want to take the stand [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5193.12s)]
*  because she didn't wanna lie. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5194.64s)]

*  They knew they were gonna lose this fucking trial. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5264.320000000001s)]
*  And I think they did it before the election [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5266.68s)]
*  because they knew that it would be completely squashed [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5269.0s)]
*  by the election. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5270.8s)]

*  I think the most expensive trial in Georgia history. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5273.72s)]
*  And they get nothing. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5276.64s)]

*  I know, it's crazy. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5279.0s)]
*  15 years probation. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5279.84s)]
*  That's nothing. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5281.360000000001s)]
*  Which I feel like eventually they're gonna take down [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5282.200000000001s)]
*  on good behavior. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5283.84s)]
*  Does that happen? [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5285.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5286.240000000001s)]
*  So you can renegotiate your probation [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5287.08s)]
*  based on good behavior. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5288.8s)]
*  So like you're on good behavior for a few years [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5289.64s)]
*  then you're taking it. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5291.360000000001s)]
*  What does probation mean? [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5292.200000000001s)]

*  Oh, really? [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5296.68s)]
*  You have a probation officer that you check in with. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5297.52s)]
*  He's kind of nice. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5298.88s)]
*  He can't associate with anybody who has gang affiliation. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5299.88s)]
*  He doesn't get so healthy. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5302.64s)]
*  How are they gonna monitor all of this? [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5303.8s)]
*  Well, that's probation officer. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5306.4400000000005s)]
*  If you tweet anything, if you post anything, [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5307.52s)]
*  it's like he really has to live like a fucking Mormon [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5310.6s)]
*  right now until the next 15 years or. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5313.56s)]
*  I mean, there are certain things [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5315.96s)]
*  that you could get away with. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5317.56s)]
*  What I would say is the probation, [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5319.52s)]
*  the, and obviously I don't know what the fuck jail is like. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5323.240000000001s)]

*  They got Kodak out? [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5354.0s)]
*  Yeah, Republicans would have never wasted money. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5354.96s)]

*  bro, we need more music. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5359.8s)]

*  Is that what it was? [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5365.0s)]
*  I just have a real quick question about, [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5365.84s)]
*  this is, Lil Wayne, I wonder if this is just media, [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5368.6s)]
*  I wonder if this is an angle trying to convince us. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5374.320000000001s)]
*  Like I look at everything that I consume right now, [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5377.52s)]
*  I was like, is there a narrative here [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5379.2s)]
*  that people are trying to justify a decision? [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5380.320000000001s)]
*  And it very well could be people are taking [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5383.6s)]
*  the worst parts of his concerts [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5386.12s)]
*  and putting them on the internet to justify him [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5387.68s)]
*  not being the Super Bowl halftime performer. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5390.44s)]
*  But what is being shown on Twitter, [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5394.599999999999s)]
*  I don't think is indicative [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5397.24s)]
*  of a Super Bowl halftime performance. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5398.5199999999995s)]
*  And I say this to someone who supported Wayne his entire life, [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5400.04s)]
*  I fucking love Wayne, one of the greatest rappers of all time. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5402.64s)]
*  Have any of you seen Wayne live? [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5404.88s)]
*  I've seen him live and it was amazing. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5407.0s)]
*  Okay, so then maybe this is people hating on the internet [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5408.92s)]
*  and trying, it's fake. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5411.599999999999s)]
*  How long is this fake news? [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5412.44s)]
*  It was a while, it was when him and Drake [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5414.0s)]
*  were doing that co-tour situation [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5415.88s)]
*  and he would actually body Drake almost every night. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5418.36s)]
*  Like I saw two shows and he steals the show. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5420.52s)]
*  Okay, so then, and what you're seeing now on the internet, [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5424.32s)]
*  you're like, this doesn't match up at all with what? [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5428.08s)]
*  Yeah, the audio wasn't good, like it was a little off. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5429.76s)]
*  So this is some hating shit. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5432.96s)]
*  I think so. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5434.04s)]
*  And who's behind that? [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5434.88s)]
*  I don't know, it's just maybe not the greatest production. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5437.04s)]
*  Also the Kendrick team online is pretty... [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5440.04s)]
*  Who's behind it, bro? [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5443.08s)]
*  I mean, who's behind it? [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5444.639999999999s)]
*  If it is then... [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5446.28s)]
*  The Democrat shill, Jay-Z. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5447.36s)]
*  The Kamala supporter, Jay-Z. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5450.76s)]
*  Jay-Z's been quiet. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5452.679999999999s)]
*  He ain't, he ain't... [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5453.5199999999995s)]
*  He got his wife out there doing a fucking fake co-tour. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5454.36s)]
*  He didn't personally endorse nobody. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5456.16s)]
*  Jay-Z know what's happening. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5458.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, because he's a criminal. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5459.48s)]
*  You don't put criminals on stage [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5461.5199999999995s)]
*  unless they're the president. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5464.0s)]
*  Exactly, he should have backed the criminal. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5465.32s)]
*  No, that is... [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5468.04s)]
*  Fucking 50 Cent is a man, bro. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5469.6s)]
*  They ask him nonstop to do... [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5471.68s)]
*  It hit me up. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5474.28s)]
*  The Trump team hit me up and asked [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5475.5199999999995s)]
*  if I could reach out to 50 [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5477.08s)]
*  to get him to come to the MSG shows. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5478.68s)]
*  And I was like, I don't know, man. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5480.88s)]
*  It's a 50-50 march to beat his own drum. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5482.64s)]
*  He does whatever he wants. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5486.24s)]
*  And he always says he doesn't do religion or politics. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5487.72s)]
*  And after Trump won, he posted a picture with him and Trump. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5492.28s)]
*  And he goes, I'm always walking out the ring with the winner. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5496.0s)]
*  Or something to that. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5499.6s)]
*  Like, you know what I mean? [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5501.68s)]
*  Like, this guy is... [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5503.08s)]
*  Yeah, he's great. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5503.92s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5505.24s)]
*  There was a great interview with him [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5506.08s)]
*  where he was talking about Nelly's It's Hot In Here. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5507.68s)]
*  Did you see this? [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5511.56s)]
*  He was on Ebro. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5512.4s)]
*  And he was talking with Ebro about Nelly's It's Hot In Here. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5513.72s)]
*  He's remembering it's hot in here, [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5516.36s)]
*  I'm getting all my clothes. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5517.92s)]
*  And he goes, when I saw that song, [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5519.68s)]
*  I was like, oh, this shit is hot in here. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5522.2s)]
*  And he goes, I'm getting all my clothes. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5523.92s)]
*  And he goes, oh, this shit is a hit. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5526.6s)]
*  And then he goes, so they make Lloyd Banks' Fire. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5528.16s)]
*  Which is like... [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5531.280000000001s)]
*  And he blatantly, I couldn't believe he was blatantly saying, [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5532.92s)]
*  he goes, so we made Lloyd Banks' Fire. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5535.280000000001s)]
*  Which is just another version of It's Hot In Here. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5537.56s)]
*  And he blatantly says, he goes, [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5541.4400000000005s)]
*  there's been plenty of times throughout my career [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5543.4800000000005s)]
*  where I saw a song that was hot, [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5545.360000000001s)]
*  and we did our version of that song was hot [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5547.2s)]
*  and then blew up. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5549.52s)]
*  Wow. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5550.68s)]
*  I couldn't believe an artist was sharing that. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5551.52s)]
*  And it just shows the way he thinks about rap. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5554.2s)]
*  He's thinking of it as, he's obviously a creative guy, [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5558.5199999999995s)]
*  but there's a business behind this. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5561.8s)]
*  McDonald's comes out with a McRib, [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5564.44s)]
*  what's Wendy's up to? [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5566.44s)]
*  It's not far how he came up, [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5568.5599999999995s)]
*  because in the mixtape scene, [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5570.24s)]
*  all he was doing was just taking people's song [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5571.599999999999s)]
*  and then remix it. And then flipping them. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5573.36s)]
*  I mean, it's smart, but just, [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5575.16s)]
*  I don't think a lot of artists would admit [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5577.12s)]
*  that there was another song that was really hot [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5579.68s)]
*  and they wanted to do a version to compete. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5581.5199999999995s)]
*  I started this, I made the whole flow, [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5585.12s)]
*  I created everything just to be like, [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5587.12s)]
*  look, this shit was fire. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5588.76s)]
*  And so we did our version. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5589.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5591.32s)]
*  Nah, 50's the man, bro. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5592.16s)]
*  Right? [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5593.08s)]
*  He's really the man. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5593.92s)]
*  We need 50 on a pod. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5594.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5595.76s)]
*  He scared me when he was going at the guy with the chain. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5596.599999999999s)]
*  That shit terrified me. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5598.5599999999995s)]
*  Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5599.4s)]
*  So a guy, a jeweler in New York. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5600.24s)]
*  Trax NYC. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5601.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, Trax, oh my God. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5602.44s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5604.5199999999995s)]
*  I didn't know this was a thing you can't do. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5605.36s)]
*  I grew up in the suburbs, [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5607.16s)]
*  I did not know it was a violation of blood culture. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5608.48s)]
*  Trax a wild boy too. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5610.44s)]
*  Tell this whole story. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5612.28s)]
*  Basically, 50 Cent gets a brand new chain. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5613.48s)]
*  Trax is a legendary, [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5615.36s)]
*  is a legendary New York City jeweler. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5616.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5619.04s)]
*  Legendary and he has used social media brilliantly [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5619.879999999999s)]
*  to build his brand. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5623.719999999999s)]
*  He does these things that you can't not look at. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5625.0s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5627.24s)]
*  He'll just take gold bars [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5628.08s)]
*  and he'll hand them out to random people in the street. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5629.32s)]
*  He'll hide them all over the city. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5631.879999999999s)]
*  He'll hide them and say, go find it. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5633.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5634.719999999999s)]
*  He's really creative with his usage of social media [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5635.5599999999995s)]
*  as advertising for his business. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5638.32s)]
*  Okay, go on. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5639.5599999999995s)]
*  But this thing terrified me, bro. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5640.4s)]
*  So basically 50 Cent comes out with a brand new chain [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5641.56s)]
*  and he's like, yo, this is my new chain. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5643.6s)]
*  He got it made by a specific jeweler [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5644.88s)]
*  that 50 always works with. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5646.240000000001s)]
*  And then Trax sees the chain and goes, [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5647.360000000001s)]
*  hey guys, 50 has the sickest new chain. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5648.68s)]
*  So I've made basically a replica that I'm selling [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5650.8s)]
*  and you can buy them now. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5653.72s)]
*  That's not exactly how it was. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5654.56s)]
*  Is that not what happened? [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5656.4400000000005s)]
*  No, 50 had an iconic chain. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5657.280000000001s)]
*  And then Trax was like, [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5659.56s)]
*  yo, remember this 50 chain for we're selling these pieces. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5660.96s)]
*  It was a Jesus piece. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5664.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5665.200000000001s)]
*  But I don't think 50 was like, [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5666.040000000001s)]
*  yo, here are my new chains [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5666.88s)]
*  and he's selling right after this. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5668.080000000001s)]
*  No, no, no, 50 just came out with a chain. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5668.92s)]
*  It was like. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5670.240000000001s)]
*  That's like an old chain. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5671.84s)]
*  No, it was a cross. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5672.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5673.5199999999995s)]
*  But it's a cross, it's the piece. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5674.36s)]
*  Yeah, it was a Jesus piece. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5675.44s)]
*  But it's an old thing. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5676.28s)]
*  That's like his iconic thing? [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5677.12s)]
*  No, it was a thing that he, I popularized. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5677.96s)]
*  But I don't know if he did a brand deal [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5680.92s)]
*  with a jeweler specifically. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5682.36s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5683.2s)]
*  He got one made not by Trax, [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5684.04s)]
*  but just by a different jeweler. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5685.6s)]
*  I just want to set the record straight for what happened. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5686.96s)]
*  And then Trax saw it and was like, oh, this chain is fire. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5689.16s)]
*  It was peace. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5691.8s)]
*  It was a cross. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5692.64s)]
*  And now I'm gonna make my own version of it. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5693.68s)]
*  And he was like, yo, here are the 50 Cent crosses. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5695.44s)]
*  Like. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5698.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5699.32s)]
*  Yeah, and he used 50 Cent in the video. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5700.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5701.839999999999s)]
*  And 50 Cent just goes, this was foolish. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5702.679999999999s)]
*  You're here for my lawyers or something like that. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5705.0s)]
*  But then Trax takes a fucking duffel bag [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5707.36s)]
*  of gold and platinum bars and goes to Queens. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5710.28s)]
*  Goes to 50's neighborhood and starts handing them out. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5715.719999999999s)]
*  And 50 got so much love in the neighborhood still, [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5718.36s)]
*  did some random street dudes just walk up to him [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5721.32s)]
*  while he's in the neighborhood and go, [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5723.36s)]
*  yo, you gotta get out of here. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5724.24s)]
*  Wow. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5725.599999999999s)]
*  He's not even in the neighborhood anymore. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5726.44s)]
*  But the fact that they knew something, [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5728.72s)]
*  he's like, yo, you gotta get the fuck out of here. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5730.24s)]
*  Is Trax the bravest guy in the world? [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5731.92s)]
*  Yeah, you know that he went and fought the watch dude [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5733.76s)]
*  that we hung out with in Ireland. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5737.36s)]
*  What? [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5739.0s)]
*  Nico. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5739.84s)]
*  Watch Nico, yeah. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5740.66s)]
*  Like he went out there and they fought. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5741.5s)]
*  Why? [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5743.72s)]
*  Because they were beefing over something [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5744.5599999999995s)]
*  and he pulled up and they boxed. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5746.24s)]
*  I'm telling you, this guy Trax is like [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5748.24s)]
*  an underrated self-marketer. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5749.8s)]
*  Like in New York City, we know him, [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5751.92s)]
*  but outside of New York, put it this way, [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5753.82s)]
*  you know how like now with the popularity of like watches, [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5756.219999999999s)]
*  all the guys on 46th Street start to really blow up [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5759.9s)]
*  the watch trading thing. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5763.5s)]
*  It became a huge trend and they deserve all their success [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5765.0599999999995s)]
*  and it's amazing. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5768.0599999999995s)]
*  But Trax before that was like a viral jewelry guy [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5770.48s)]
*  in an area that we knew in the city. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5776.46s)]
*  But I guess it wasn't, I don't know, [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5780.34s)]
*  how do you describe it? [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5781.94s)]
*  I'm just saying to make noise being on [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5782.9s)]
*  in the Diamond District is crazy [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5786.139999999999s)]
*  because it's like opening a shoe store [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5787.9s)]
*  and there's a thousand other shoe stores right next to you. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5790.9s)]
*  So you have to be cutthroat, [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5793.58s)]
*  you have to mark yourself better than everybody, [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5795.5s)]
*  you have to just do something different to stand out. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5797.86s)]
*  He's been able to stand out. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5800.219999999999s)]
*  Greg Yuna is another one. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5801.679999999999s)]
*  Greg makes a beautiful baby. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5803.179999999999s)]
*  Great marketing. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5805.259999999999s)]
*  Moses the jeweler. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5806.099999999999s)]
*  Moses the jeweler has been phenomenal. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5807.46s)]
*  He's been phenomenal and there's one more kid [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5809.82s)]
*  I was talking to, oh fuck, he does some stuff with Moses. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5812.18s)]
*  Benny? [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5815.9400000000005s)]
*  What's his name? [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5816.780000000001s)]
*  Vukom, Vukom, Vukom. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5817.620000000001s)]

*  All I'm saying is 50 cent comments on my post, [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5820.3s)]
*  this was foolish. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5822.14s)]
*  You've taken a post down. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5823.5s)]
*  I'm on probation, I'm on Young Thug Time. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5825.1s)]
*  I'm going to Malibu, I'm 15 years, [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5827.3s)]
*  you'll never hear about me. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5829.22s)]
*  No, the best Trax will see that is like, [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5830.06s)]
*  he's like, let's go. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5832.54s)]
*  So that's really the content. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5833.700000000001s)]
*  Trax has some Vince McMahon. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5835.58s)]
*  He's like, this is gonna be fun, let's dance. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5836.780000000001s)]
*  Terrifying. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5839.620000000001s)]
*  I've had several days to do it, [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5840.5s)]
*  because 50 also said, I'm gonna need that by Monday, [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5841.3s)]
*  which is the scariest thing that 50 could ever. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5843.74s)]
*  What does that even mean? [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5846.38s)]
*  I'm gonna need that by Monday, what? [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5847.58s)]
*  I'm gonna need the money for you to do that. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5849.38s)]
*  Because the famous battle that he got into [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5851.22s)]
*  was with the producer, Randall Emmett, [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5853.34s)]
*  and it was the greatest reality show that's ever existed. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5855.54s)]
*  Tell this story, this is fire, bro. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5858.42s)]
*  Randall Emmett's a producer that was making [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5860.54s)]
*  all these indie movies with 50 cent, [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5862.54s)]
*  and I think he just owed him a few hundred grand [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5864.34s)]
*  that he didn't get. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5867.26s)]
*  And his wife was one of the chicks on Vanderpump Rules, [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5868.1s)]
*  okay, so they got into it over something. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5871.34s)]
*  And they got into it, there was just nothing. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5875.22s)]
*  50 laid it all out. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5876.9s)]
*  But it was nonstop, and it was just like this guy. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5878.38s)]
*  Just dirt about him? [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5882.14s)]
*  Dirt, posting the least flattering photos [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5883.66s)]
*  you've ever seen. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5886.38s)]
*  He's coked up and shit, like, yeah. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5887.22s)]
*  And then he would actually then post the calls of this guy, [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5890.86s)]
*  hey, 50, please stop, please stop doing this. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5894.86s)]
*  It was crazy, it was pure torture. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5898.82s)]
*  And then he eventually got paid and then? [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5901.54s)]
*  Yeah, that's terrifying. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5903.78s)]
*  50 cent, can someone get to hold of you? [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5904.74s)]
*  Any one of them, you're done. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5907.62s)]
*  50 or Candice, you don't want no problems. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5908.94s)]
*  I know Candice tweeted a little video of us saying, [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5911.74s)]
*  we don't want no problems. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5915.42s)]
*  Just the fact that she tweeted a video of us, [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5917.46s)]
*  I was like, that was fucked. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5919.0199999999995s)]

*  Don't play around with Candice, you don't play around [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5931.78s)]
*  with 50 cents, simple as that. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxPKu3kXeTM&t=5933.219999999999s)]
