*  Get the f*** out of here, dude. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=9.52s)]
*  It's seriously offensive. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=12.32s)]
*  Get out of here. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=13.780000000000001s)]
*  Done has brought us to this moment. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=15.52s)]
*  That is the craziest I've ever seen in my life. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=18.62s)]
*  Welcome to the show. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=24.12s)]
*  Miles, you want to introduce your tag or not? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=26.060000000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=28.439999999999998s)]
*  Today we are joined by... [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  Oh, the mentalist is in the building. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=31.74s)]
*  Flagrant. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=35.339999999999996s)]
*  Yes, finally. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=36.339999999999996s)]
*  It means conspicuously offensive. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=37.339999999999996s)]
*  Is that not the definition? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=39.08s)]
*  Eight-letter word, flagrant. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=41.08s)]
*  Looked it up. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=42.379999999999995s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=43.379999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, we didn't know that. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=44.379999999999995s)]
*  Maybe we understand why people think we are that. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=45.379999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=47.18s)]
*  I think it was spot on. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=48.18s)]
*  What does conspicuous mean? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=49.18s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=50.18s)]
*  Dude, I'm so stoked that you're here. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=51.18s)]
*  This is a long time coming. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=52.46s)]
*  Obviously, you broke the internet by guessing Joe's ATM pin. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=53.599999999999994s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=57.06s)]
*  I was looking around about how many things Joe does believe that are conspiratorial, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=58.72s)]
*  and he was looking at you, he was like, there's no fucking way that this is real. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=61.92s)]
*  He was less skeptical of Bob Lazar saying he was reverse engineering alien technology [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=64.92s)]
*  than me dumpster diving. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=69.94s)]
*  I went to dinner with him and Bob. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=70.94s)]
*  Did you? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=76.1s)]
*  Yeah, before that episode. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=77.1s)]
*  That was wild. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=78.1s)]
*  You should have brought me in. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=79.1s)]
*  I would have told you if you was lying. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=80.1s)]
*  That's what I was going to say. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=81.1s)]
*  I was like, we got to get to, if you're able, if we're subscribing to the mentalism, you [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=82.1s)]
*  should really know what's going on in the world, what's going to happen. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=86.38s)]
*  So it's not a supernatural power. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=88.94s)]
*  People will come up to you can't believe how many people wrote to me and they're like, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=90.66s)]
*  what's my Bitcoin password? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=93.97999999999999s)]
*  I'm like, bro, if I knew that you have your Bitcoin right now. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=94.97999999999999s)]
*  But I assess people. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=97.97999999999999s)]
*  Is this a magician's tricks? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=100.58s)]
*  But done without the props? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=103.17999999999999s)]
*  I brought some fun stuff. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=105.46s)]
*  I brought some show and tell baby. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=106.46s)]
*  I brought some cards. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=107.46s)]
*  Okay, good. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=108.46s)]
*  I want to get into it right away. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=109.46s)]
*  I like the caution and intensity of cops. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=110.46s)]
*  You just got into magician territory with the props now. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=111.46s)]
*  I want to do something fun, but I want to show you the difference between magic and [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=114.98s)]
*  mentalism because I started as a magician. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=117.42s)]
*  Most mentalists start as magicians. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=120.46000000000001s)]
*  That's kind of the, you got to crawl before you can walk, before you can run. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=122.42s)]
*  And so a lot of the same tactics, foundational skills come from magic because you learn how [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=125.86000000000001s)]
*  to fool people. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=130.42000000000002s)]
*  You learn how people think. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=131.42000000000002s)]
*  It's the same way. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=132.42000000000002s)]
*  My favorite art form by far, standup comedy. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=133.42000000000002s)]
*  Respect. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=135.94s)]
*  Forget, forget magic and mentalism. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=136.94s)]
*  I watch comedians. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=137.94s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=138.94s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=139.94s)]
*  Are we fooling and tricking? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=140.94s)]
*  Am I, should I, should I fluff this guy? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=141.94s)]
*  I've seen life like five or six times. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=143.7s)]
*  Thank you, bro. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=144.7s)]
*  Fanboy your little Meek Mill, am I right? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=145.7s)]
*  Soon, he does his research. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=148.7s)]
*  But I mean, that's the real mark is how do you take a subject that's not funny and make [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=151.7s)]
*  it funny? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=155.98s)]
*  And I think the same thing applies to mentalism is I will know not only what you think, but [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=156.98s)]
*  I know how you think. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=163.26s)]
*  And are you pushing us? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=165.06s)]
*  That's the way I'm doing it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=166.06s)]
*  But are you pushing us in a direction to think certain things? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=167.06s)]
*  Well, let's watch. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=169.78s)]
*  I walked in here, full transparency. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=171.62s)]
*  People watch us, they always go, he set this up. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=172.62s)]
*  He told you, he whispered, Alex, do this or do that. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=173.9s)]
*  I tell you what, I walked in here and we were just about to go on air and I said, if you [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=176.5s)]
*  could think of the number one person you would want to interview, right? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=180.14s)]
*  You didn't write this, you didn't say this, you did nothing. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=183.22s)]
*  You thought of someone in your head. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=185.86s)]
*  And I asked you, would they know who you thought of? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=187.18s)]
*  And what was your answer to that? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=190.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=191.7s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=192.7s)]
*  That's what they said. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=193.7s)]
*  Jeffrey Star. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=194.7s)]
*  They think it would be an obvious choice for you, the number one. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=195.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=198.14s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=199.14s)]
*  I'm probably not going to guess it because it's that obvious the internet knows. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=200.5s)]
*  What do you think is the first letter of the name of the person he's thinking of? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=204.01999999999998s)]
*  H. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=207.94s)]
*  Well, it depends how you spell the person's name. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=208.94s)]
*  J would be the first letter. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=211.29999999999998s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=213.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=214.7s)]
*  So who did you go with? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=215.7s)]
*  Jay Z. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=216.7s)]
*  Jay Z. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=217.7s)]
*  Okay, number one. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=218.7s)]
*  H was Hov is what I was going to say. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=219.7s)]
*  There you go. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=220.7s)]
*  So that was number one and they all know that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=221.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=223.42s)]
*  So right away, that's easy. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=224.42s)]
*  Like if I did that, nobody cares. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=225.42s)]
*  So if I say to you, jump down to who would be number two on the list. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=228.3s)]
*  Now your brain starts to go, I did Jay Z. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=232.34s)]
*  Goaded. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=234.98000000000002s)]
*  Who do we go to next? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=235.98000000000002s)]
*  Now I think right away his body language didn't change. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=237.82000000000002s)]
*  I might have gone to a female at that point. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=240.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=241.70000000000002s)]
*  But my man went to another guy. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=242.70000000000002s)]
*  Is it another guy? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=243.70000000000002s)]

*  I want to know. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=536.66s)]
*  I want to know and I have ideas about how many people [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=538.66s)]
*  you've used certain words to prime him in a certain direction [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=541.06s)]
*  and then create that outcome. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=543.06s)]
*  He rolled his eyes in the back of his fucking head. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=545.06s)]
*  I don't know if you rolled your eyes like I was being an idiot [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=547.06s)]
*  or like you've heard this a million times. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=549.06s)]
*  Never heard it. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=551.06s)]
*  You hugged the line of the best kind of engagement [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=553.06s)]
*  which is you're both angry and happy at the same time. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=555.06s)]
*  I just want to indulge because I just want to have the most fun [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=557.06s)]
*  but there's this part of me that's like [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=559.06s)]
*  I see how he pushed him in that direction. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=561.06s)]
*  Well it's funny. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=563.06s)]
*  It's like you're just trying to get him to do something [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=565.06s)]
*  that's not really funny. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=567.06s)]
*  Well it's funny because it's jazz. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=569.4599999999999s)]
*  Again I paraphrase with comedy [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=571.4599999999999s)]
*  because comedy is so good. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=573.4599999999999s)]
*  You're reacting to the stimulus that you have in front of you. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=575.4599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, everything's happening in real time [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=577.4599999999999s)]
*  and there's different people. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=579.4599999999999s)]
*  Listen, there's a handful of us that do this stuff. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=581.4599999999999s)]
*  That's the funny thing. You asked me magicians? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=583.4599999999999s)]
*  Tons of magicians in the world. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=585.4599999999999s)]
*  You said dead or alive multiple times. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=587.4599999999999s)]
*  And then you switched the order. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=589.4599999999999s)]
*  And I'm wondering if you're priming him [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=591.4599999999999s)]
*  to give a dead person [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=593.4599999999999s)]
*  and that's just where my brain was going. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=595.4599999999999s)]
*  Also he's got him on his arm. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=597.86s)]
*  That's what I thought. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=599.86s)]
*  He just hedged on a tattoo. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=601.86s)]
*  I only go to black guys with tattoos on their foreheads. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=603.86s)]
*  This is a very specific situation. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=605.86s)]
*  You want hard knocks. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=607.86s)]
*  Sticking to football teams primarily. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=609.86s)]
*  Would this be a skill? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=611.86s)]
*  Where are your tattoos? Nothing? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=613.86s)]
*  Nothing. Not yet. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=615.86s)]
*  Would this be a skill you wouldn't call? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=617.86s)]
*  He just touched you Bart. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=619.86s)]
*  You don't even know what I just planted on him. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=621.86s)]
*  Microchip embedded. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=623.86s)]
*  I got everything. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=626.26s)]
*  Would you call this applied cold reading? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=628.26s)]
*  There's a ton of cold reading mixed in. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=630.26s)]
*  But here's the secret sauce. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=632.26s)]
*  There's a lot of secret sauces. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=634.26s)]
*  But I can tell you that mine is that [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=636.26s)]
*  there's so many methods going on at once [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=638.26s)]
*  that I will lead you in a maze. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=640.26s)]
*  And when you get to this one [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=642.26s)]
*  and you're really, here's the cheese. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=644.26s)]
*  And you got right there and you can smell it. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=646.26s)]
*  Boom. You hit a wall. You have to go all the way around. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=648.26s)]
*  Because I typically, like in a day like today [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=650.26s)]
*  there will be 8, 9, 10 different methods [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=652.26s)]
*  that I will teach you. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=654.66s)]
*  And I will teach you that even my peers [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=656.66s)]
*  even the people who do what I do [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=658.66s)]
*  again, not a Humblbrack [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=660.66s)]
*  they do not know. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=662.66s)]
*  I did for Howard Stern something [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=664.66s)]
*  that I assure you nobody in my field can understand [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=666.66s)]
*  how I did it. Because he will go to his grave [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=668.66s)]
*  this is one thing of guessing a person [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=670.66s)]
*  he will go to his grave saying I never shared that with anybody [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=672.66s)]
*  I never wrote it [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=674.66s)]
*  I never put it any, I didn't have my phone [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=676.66s)]
*  I didn't whisper it, my wife didn't even know this [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=678.66s)]
*  somebody died and then told me it before they died [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=680.66s)]
*  I remember my wife, I remember her, I remember her [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=683.06s)]

*  Got it, so you have failsafe, failsafe, failsafe [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=770.26s)]
*  Big time, like I did Rogan, this is gonna air after Rogan [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=772.26s)]
*  So Rogan, I had so many things going in there [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=774.26s)]
*  So Rogan, I had so many things going in there [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=776.26s)]
*  I love Joe, that's the lion's den [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=778.26s)]
*  He is skeptical, he is [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=780.26s)]
*  I don't want to call it combative [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=782.26s)]
*  But when I walked in the door, there was no jokey humor [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=784.26s)]
*  It was not like, what's up, this wasn't like here [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=786.26s)]
*  He was serious [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=788.26s)]
*  And he did not know I was gonna guess his pin code on air [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=790.26s)]
*  That was unbelievable [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=792.26s)]
*  At all, there was no mention of a pin code [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=794.26s)]
*  Before that moment to him [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=796.66s)]
*  And so he [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=798.66s)]
*  He thinks that I somehow stole his identity [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=800.66s)]
*  And everyone thinks I'm a Mossad agent [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=802.66s)]
*  So that was quite funny in the comments [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=804.66s)]
*  I mean you did guess, you guessed the bank code [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=806.66s)]
*  I don't know if you're leaning into a stereotype [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=808.66s)]
*  But if you know somebody at the bank [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=810.66s)]
*  That might be an easy thing [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=812.66s)]
*  That is like your go-to thing now that [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=814.66s)]
*  Now that you mention it, it's always bank related [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=816.66s)]
*  I asked him, I asked him, I was like [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=818.66s)]
*  How do you pronounce your first name? He's like, it's O's [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=820.66s)]
*  Like O's you money [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=822.66s)]

*  Before me asking you to think of this person [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1152.66s)]
*  When was the last time she even entered your mind? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1154.66s)]
*  Be honest, would it have been days, months or years? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1156.66s)]
*  Probably a year and a half [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1158.66s)]
*  That doesn't match up with the 6 year marriage [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1160.66s)]
*  But okay [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1162.66s)]
*  5 year marriage plus 6 years before that [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1164.66s)]
*  You know how she looked [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1166.66s)]
*  My girl [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1168.66s)]
*  Alright, year and a half [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1170.66s)]
*  Since he saw this person before today [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1172.66s)]
*  When I asked him [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1174.66s)]
*  Think of the letters, mix them up [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1176.66s)]
*  Grab one [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1178.66s)]
*  Don't say it, grab one [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1180.66s)]
*  I'm going to do something with scrabble tiles later [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1182.66s)]
*  But I want you to imagine you grab one of these letters [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1184.66s)]
*  Out right now [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1186.66s)]
*  Right now in your head, you got to open your eyes [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1188.66s)]
*  Look at the word [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1190.66s)]
*  And you didn't go to the end [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1192.66s)]
*  You didn't do the last letter, did you? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1194.66s)]
*  It went like a back and forth [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1196.66s)]
*  And you debated between two and then you jumped to the later one [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1198.66s)]
*  D, are you thinking of a D? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1200.66s)]
*  Don't say anything [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1202.66s)]
*  He thought of the D and he switched to the one right before it [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1204.66s)]
*  Totally knew that [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1206.66s)]
*  You freaking liar, I knew you did the D [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1208.66s)]
*  I'm about to do another D [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1210.66s)]
*  Everybody who's a podcast listener [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1212.66s)]
*  I wrote it down, I showed it to Alex, Akash, and Andrew [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1214.66s)]
*  Is that correct? Hasn't thought of this person a year and a half [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1216.66s)]
*  What would you peg the percentages [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1218.66s)]
*  That I could have found from social media or somewhere [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1220.66s)]
*  Is it like half a percent, little percentage [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1222.66s)]
*  Zero, there's no way you've ever posted this [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1224.66s)]
*  Ever, talked about this ever, is that a fair assessment? [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1226.66s)]
*  Yeah, probably never [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1228.66s)]
*  Never talked about it, maybe a follow [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1230.66s)]
*  Maybe a follow on Instagram [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1232.66s)]
*  How many followers you got? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1234.66s)]
*  Four hundred thousand or something [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1236.66s)]

*  No, we agree, you don't have to [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1266.66s)]
*  Why do you seem unimpressed by that [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1268.66s)]
*  That was unbelievable [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1270.66s)]
*  I think he's a little thrown off, he's a little rattled [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1272.66s)]
*  Are you gonna be dealing with something at home? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1274.66s)]
*  What are you processing right now? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1276.66s)]
*  A man didn't mean to bring this up on air [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1278.66s)]
*  This is a fifth grade girl that I dated for two days [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1280.66s)]
*  Fourth grade, check later, it was exactly fourth grade [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1282.66s)]
*  No fucking chance [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1284.66s)]
*  No fucking chance [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1286.66s)]
*  No no no, fifth grade, you almost got me [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1288.66s)]
*  I was homeschooled until fifth grade [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1290.66s)]
*  It's actually a sister for the record [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1292.66s)]
*  How'd you know that? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1296.66s)]
*  I don't know, he's gonna check later [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1298.66s)]

*  Holy shit, you were right, it was fourth grade [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1302.66s)]
*  Wait, why would it be fourth grade? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1304.66s)]
*  I don't check later, I got a feeling [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1306.66s)]
*  He was homeschooled until fifth grade [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1308.66s)]
*  Maybe she was in fourth grade [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1310.66s)]
*  No, we were same grade [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1312.66s)]
*  Can't get every time [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1314.66s)]
*  Younger woman one year, it's age appropriate [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1316.66s)]
*  She hit the floor in the middle [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1320.66s)]
*  That is crazy [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1322.66s)]
*  Oh my goodness, okay [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1324.66s)]
*  I'm gonna go [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1326.66s)]
*  There's no interview [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1328.66s)]
*  Nothing is more interesting than magic [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1330.66s)]
*  Okay, how long can you run? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1332.66s)]
*  The interview runs [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1334.66s)]
*  I don't get into the joke story [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1336.66s)]
*  I get all hours [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1338.66s)]
*  I know about it, but there's nothing more interesting [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1340.66s)]
*  than what you're doing right now [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1342.66s)]
*  So I can ask you about the ultra marathon [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1344.66s)]
*  I looked up that you won the New Jersey [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1346.66s)]
*  marathon four times [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1348.66s)]
*  I thought that in the notes that it was like [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1350.66s)]
*  a typo [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1352.66s)]
*  It was run [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1354.66s)]
*  Oh, it was supposed to be run, but it was won [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1356.66s)]
*  No, you actually won it four times [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1358.66s)]
*  Did they not allow the African [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1360.66s)]
*  How did you beat them? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1362.66s)]
*  It's Jersey, so no [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1364.66s)]
*  Just put a mind spell, there's no money in it [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1366.66s)]
*  So there's no prize money, so they don't run it [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1368.66s)]
*  So yeah, they only weekend warriors [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1370.66s)]
*  You ran two marathons in a week [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1372.66s)]
*  I ran them every day [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1374.66s)]
*  I won two marathons back to back days [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1376.66s)]
*  So I did the Hamptons marathon on a Saturday [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1378.66s)]
*  and Yonkers marathon on a Sunday [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1380.66s)]
*  Wow [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1382.66s)]
*  Those are winnable [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1384.66s)]
*  Yeah [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1386.66s)]
*  Like never [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1388.66s)]
*  Those who could win back to back [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1390.66s)]
*  It was an interesting dynamic change [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1392.66s)]
*  from the Hamptons to Yonkers [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1394.66s)]
*  If you win like Nairobi, then maybe [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1396.66s)]
*  And for real [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1398.66s)]
*  But they wouldn't let a witch run it though [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1400.66s)]
*  It wouldn't make it there [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1402.66s)]
*  Holy shit [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1404.66s)]
*  Is there a peer that has done an effect to you [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1406.66s)]
*  that you're unable to explain? [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1408.66s)]
*  That's the best thing, that's the best feeling ever [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1410.66s)]
*  when somebody just rattles you [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1412.66s)]
*  and you go, oh my god, how did you do that? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1414.66s)]
*  And the problem is, I go right into [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1416.66s)]
*  Andrew mode, which is I want to know how [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1418.66s)]
*  Because that's my default setting, but then I also want to be like [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1420.66s)]
*  Enjoy this [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1422.66s)]
*  Will they share it with you? Is there like a code amongst [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1424.66s)]
*  Typically yes [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1426.66s)]
*  Also in this kind of situation, here's the thing [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1428.66s)]
*  There's people that write [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1430.66s)]
*  There's people that are creators and there's performers [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1432.66s)]
*  And there's very few both [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1434.66s)]
*  There's so few in what I do because [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1436.66s)]
*  I'm creative is one thing, but to actually execute [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1438.66s)]
*  So there's certain guys that can create the [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1440.66s)]
*  What do you call them? I don't want to [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1442.66s)]
*  I call them tricks, let's call them tricks [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1444.66s)]
*  It's funny when somebody calls it a vaudevillian [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1446.66s)]
*  Do your skit, do your skit [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1448.66s)]
*  Or do the Friars, do that skit again [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1450.66s)]
*  We call them effects within the [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1452.66s)]
*  Within the community [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1454.66s)]
*  That's what he told Jordan in fifth grade [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1458.66s)]
*  This is kind of an effect [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1460.66s)]
*  So there are guys [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1462.66s)]
*  That maybe come up with the effects, but they [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1464.66s)]
*  Don't have the skills to actually [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1466.66s)]
*  Execute them [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1468.66s)]
*  I would say the skills is one way to put it, but a lot of them are just not performers [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1470.66s)]
*  So it's you know, S&L [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1472.66s)]
*  How many writers are there? I'm not saying they're [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1474.66s)]
*  Not talented, but getting on camera [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1476.66s)]
*  Execution is the difficult part [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1478.66s)]
*  In this profession [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1480.66s)]
*  Were you always good at that or is that a skill that you had to develop? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1482.66s)]
*  I think it was skill developed, like I've been [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1484.66s)]
*  A teenager, but I did magic at restaurants [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1486.66s)]
*  When I was a kid [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1488.66s)]
*  And that was really what got me good [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1490.66s)]
*  That's where the 10,000, 20,000 hours were put in [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1492.66s)]
*  I think it was because I got my first restaurant gig when I was 14 [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1494.66s)]
*  Do you remember where it was? 100% [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1496.66s)]
*  It's a big part of my book, it's called Zia's [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1498.66s)]
*  It's in Michigan [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1500.66s)]
*  I walk there half a mile from my house, don't know how I had the confidence [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1502.66s)]
*  Good sales tactics [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1504.66s)]
*  Talked my way into this thing [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1506.66s)]
*  Tuesday nights, that was my night, I did three hours [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1508.66s)]
*  It made me like 50 bucks [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1510.66s)]
*  Imagine you're at a restaurant [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1512.66s)]
*  You got a babysitter, the kids are at home [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1514.66s)]
*  And some [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1516.66s)]
*  14 year old kid comes up to the table [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1518.66s)]
*  Wanting to do cartridge [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1520.66s)]
*  You're getting out of here [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1522.66s)]
*  Some people would, some people wouldn't [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1524.66s)]
*  So you have to learn, school of hard knocks, how to win people over [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1526.66s)]
*  Quick is the name of the game [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1528.66s)]
*  That's exactly it [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1530.66s)]
*  What is your body language like? What you iterate [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1532.66s)]
*  When I turn this way, it's different than if I go head on [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1534.66s)]
*  The same with the animals, when they go eye to eye, they feel imposing [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1536.66s)]
*  So you're like looking over your shoulder almost [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1538.66s)]
*  You're not giving them too much attention [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1540.66s)]
*  There's a million things that I learned how to [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1542.66s)]
*  Approach a table in less than 10 seconds [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1544.66s)]
*  Typically 5 seconds [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1546.66s)]
*  Answer every question that was in their mind that was unanswered [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1548.66s)]
*  Which is right when they see me [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1550.66s)]
*  Automatically they go, who is this? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1552.66s)]
*  Do I have to give this person money? Do I have cash? What are they doing here? [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1554.66s)]
*  Are they any good? Did the restaurant know they were here? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1556.66s)]
*  All of those questions I try to answer in the least amount of words possible [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1558.66s)]
*  Can you give us that breakdown? [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1560.66s)]
*  I imagine you haven't done this in decades [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1562.66s)]
*  So what was your 5 second [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1564.66s)]
*  I'm going to break the table [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1566.66s)]
*  They're having a big dinner, it's a family dinner [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1568.66s)]
*  Somebody just got engaged, there's a celebration [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1570.66s)]
*  You're going to interrupt it, how do you stop that in 5 seconds? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1572.66s)]
*  First off you find the right moment [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1574.66s)]
*  So if people are like, husband and wife is crying and they're like having a [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1576.66s)]
*  Big dinner [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1578.66s)]
*  So I hear you've been cheating on her [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1580.66s)]
*  I've got something amazing as well [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1582.66s)]
*  Can you make this bitch disappear? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1584.66s)]
*  Can you keep that in his pants? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1586.66s)]
*  I can only make things up here not disappear [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1588.66s)]
*  So you walk up [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1590.66s)]
*  And the first thing I say is [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1592.66s)]
*  You guys are in luck [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1594.66s)]
*  Right away that's a great way, at an angle [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1596.66s)]
*  You guys are in luck, the owner brought me in as a special treat to you tonight [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1598.66s)]
*  But I only have 2 minutes [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1600.66s)]
*  So it's like right away [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1602.66s)]
*  You only have 2 minutes [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1604.66s)]
*  They're getting something, they don't know what they're getting [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1606.66s)]
*  So curiosity [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1608.66s)]
*  The owner has me here as a treat [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1610.66s)]
*  Immediately takes away the first thing [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1612.66s)]
*  Which to me is like, yo guys coming up to me, do I have to have some cash right now? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1614.66s)]
*  Awkwardness [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1616.66s)]
*  I'm taking away all of the resistance [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1618.66s)]
*  And if you say no [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1620.66s)]
*  You're being disrespectful to the person [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1622.66s)]
*  That gave you as the gift [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1624.66s)]
*  Of course, the owner brought me in special [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1626.66s)]
*  If you clean windshields on the street you should be paying attention to this right now [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1628.66s)]
*  If you sell anything [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1630.66s)]
*  If you're cleaning windshields you're moving up [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1632.66s)]
*  But that's literally what I've done is sales training [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1634.66s)]
*  Is understand how to think like a mentalist [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1636.66s)]
*  Because most of what I do [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1638.66s)]
*  Is selling an item which is amazement [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1640.66s)]
*  Right? That's what I sell [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1642.66s)]
*  You sell laughter, I sell amazement [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1644.66s)]
*  I sell wonder moments that are memorable [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1646.66s)]
*  That you go, how did he know that? [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1648.66s)]
*  And that feeling you had at that moment when you felt it [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1650.66s)]
*  But everyone knows it's not real [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1652.66s)]
*  And I know it's not real [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1654.66s)]
*  I'm not really reading your mind [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1656.66s)]
*  I've explained that through and through [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1658.66s)]
*  I've learned how people think [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1660.66s)]
*  And I'm not really reading your mind [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1662.66s)]
*  I'm not reading your mind [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1664.66s)]

*  I'm not reading your mind [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1688.66s)]
*  You are still [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1690.66s)]
*  At the end of the day you have to figure out Jordan [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1692.66s)]
*  And that is I would say reading his mind to a certain extent [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1694.66s)]
*  Oh absolutely [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1696.66s)]
*  Again I got the letter [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1698.66s)]
*  What was the letter you thought of? [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1700.66s)]
*  Which letter did you go with? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1702.66s)]
*  When I said pick the letter [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1704.66s)]
*  I was thinking A [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1706.66s)]
*  I told you to switch the one before [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1708.66s)]
*  I said I knew it [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1710.66s)]
*  I told him don't do a vowel [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1712.66s)]
*  He said I'm going to do a vowel instead [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1714.66s)]
*  I mentioned the scrabble tiles, I said there would be no vowels [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1716.66s)]
*  I knew he would do the D [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1718.66s)]
*  I can show you how I put the whole thing together [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1720.66s)]
*  That's the interesting part [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1722.66s)]
*  So you're 14 years old [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1724.66s)]
*  Do you ever in your life [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1726.66s)]
*  I remember reading somewhere [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1728.66s)]
*  That you broke your fear of rejection [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1730.66s)]
*  At a young age [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1732.66s)]
*  Was there ever a time in your life [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1734.66s)]
*  I had to because people just shot you down at a restaurant [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1736.66s)]
*  And if you go to 5 tables in a row [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1738.66s)]
*  Where they get out of here [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1740.66s)]
*  They're like oh dude I don't have time for this [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1742.66s)]
*  Dismissive, rude, people that don't have thick skin [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1744.66s)]
*  That's done [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1746.66s)]
*  So what did you do with dismissive, rude? [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1748.66s)]
*  I had some sort of weird schizophrenic break in my mind [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1750.66s)]
*  Which I've used for the rest of my life [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1752.66s)]
*  That's saved me rejection [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1754.66s)]
*  I silo, I literally created two people [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1756.66s)]
*  The same way you have an agent [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1758.66s)]
*  Your agent negotiates your deals [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1760.66s)]
*  They do bad cop, you tell them that [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1762.66s)]
*  You don't want to get on the phone [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1764.66s)]
*  You're Andrew, you're the nice guy [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1766.66s)]
*  So if you can create a disconnect [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1768.66s)]
*  That you just somehow slice in my brain [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1770.66s)]
*  Where I decided they aren't insulting me [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1772.66s)]
*  They're insulting the circumstance [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1774.66s)]
*  Nope, I had like in my mind [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1776.66s)]
*  There's Oz the entertainer, there's Oz Perlman [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1778.66s)]
*  You know it's like a Sia [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1780.66s)]
*  It's like the Daft Punk guy [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1782.66s)]
*  One takes it off, one takes his kids to school [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1784.66s)]
*  Nobody knows who he is [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1786.66s)]
*  I just somehow took the sting away [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1788.66s)]
*  Because I realized this is not going to sit well [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1790.66s)]
*  Because after two tables reject me [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1792.66s)]
*  I go to the next table with negative energy [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1794.66s)]
*  I'm also rude and mean [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1796.66s)]
*  And I've got to take that away [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1798.66s)]
*  So I had to figure out a way for my own self preservation [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1800.66s)]
*  I'm going to put it all on me [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1802.66s)]
*  They had a bad night, they might have just been home with their kids [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1804.66s)]
*  Their kid might have puked, I don't know [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1806.66s)]
*  I had some sort of maturity level where I'm like [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1808.66s)]
*  They have issues, it's not my fault [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1810.66s)]
*  So I'm going to let that go, they don't know the real me [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1812.66s)]
*  This didn't hurt at all, and I think that's good [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1814.66s)]
*  You know where I learned it from? Buddies who are good with girls [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1816.66s)]
*  Who just had numbers game [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1818.66s)]
*  I look at them and I couldn't do this in my real life [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1820.66s)]
*  She rejects me, she's like you've got to be kidding right now [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1822.66s)]
*  I'm like oh, because there was no Oz the entertainer [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1824.66s)]
*  She didn't want me [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1826.66s)]
*  But when I was performing I could separate myself [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1828.66s)]
*  I had to learn and I think it's useful in life [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1830.66s)]
*  Anything you're doing, you don't realize it? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1832.66s)]
*  You're selling, everyone's selling something [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1834.66s)]
*  What is your best opener? [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1836.66s)]
*  Now [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1838.66s)]
*  You're walking up to a complete stranger in the street [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1840.66s)]
*  What is your best go-to opener? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1842.66s)]
*  For a professional thing or for what reason? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1844.66s)]
*  It could be anything, you want to stop that person [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1846.66s)]
*  in the street because you want to deliver a trick [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1848.66s)]
*  You want to talk to them, but like what is [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1850.66s)]
*  the one sentence in your life right now [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1852.66s)]
*  that if you need somebody's attention for 15 seconds [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1854.66s)]
*  uninterrupted that you open with? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1856.66s)]
*  Well if it's for me performing [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1858.66s)]
*  I have a very different thing than if it's actually [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1860.66s)]
*  me talking to somebody, but I also dissect the situation [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1862.66s)]
*  What if it's you just want to talk to somebody? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1864.66s)]
*  If I want to talk to somebody? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1866.66s)]
*  You want to talk to Obama you came up to and you had a line [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1868.66s)]
*  He's asking about your sales technique [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1870.66s)]
*  Oh, so right away you create a dopamine hit [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1872.66s)]
*  So people want excitement [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1874.66s)]
*  People like, you know why your phone's so addictive? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1876.66s)]
*  Because whenever it buzzes you don't know what's at the end of that [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1878.66s)]
*  It's the lottery, you might just won the lottery [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1880.66s)]
*  Who just texted me? [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1882.66s)]
*  I got to see it, who just liked my photo? [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1884.66s)]
*  Who just commented? Who just followed me? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1886.66s)]
*  You don't know the limitless opportunities [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1888.66s)]
*  So you never want to pigeonhole yourself [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1890.66s)]
*  So I like to do things that are hanging threads [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1892.66s)]
*  If I meet somebody [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1894.66s)]
*  I've done this a million times, meet somebody super famous [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1896.66s)]
*  and we've had a real connection [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1898.66s)]
*  and in that moment I want to set us up as equals [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1900.66s)]
*  Power dynamic [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1902.66s)]
*  Why don't we be like, oh let me get the selfie, let me do this [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1904.66s)]
*  I'm like, what do we do man, how do we keep in touch? [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1906.66s)]
*  I like that phrase [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1908.66s)]
*  It puts the ball in their court but it assesses where we are [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1910.66s)]
*  Versus if I have to ask you, hey can I get your number? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1912.66s)]
*  Maybe they're going to say no [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1914.66s)]
*  I've also given you a no question [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1916.66s)]
*  Always have questions that can be continued [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1918.66s)]
*  The best lines are ones that don't have a hard answer [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1920.66s)]
*  They allow people to open up [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1922.66s)]
*  And that they're questions people haven't been asked before [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1924.66s)]
*  Like you've been asked the same 20 questions [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1926.66s)]
*  About comedy your whole life [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1928.66s)]
*  And I could go down the list, the same as me [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1930.66s)]
*  How'd you get in this? Does someone in your family do this? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1932.66s)]
*  There's like a whole list because we have unique professions [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1934.66s)]
*  You never ask an insurance salesman [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1936.66s)]
*  Was your dad an insurance salesman? [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1938.66s)]
*  I don't give a shit [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1940.66s)]
*  I'm not an insurance salesman, they book me a lot, I love insurance [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1942.66s)]
*  But I'm saying that [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1944.66s)]
*  In that situation [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1946.66s)]
*  If you could go back in time to when you were 7 years old [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1948.66s)]
*  What would you tell yourself now? [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1950.66s)]
*  That's, wow, I never thought of that [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1952.66s)]
*  Like a question that's fascinating [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1954.66s)]
*  So give me an example of that, like a fascinating question [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1956.66s)]
*  You're at a grocery store, there's somebody that [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1958.66s)]
*  I would do it based on reading the person [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1960.66s)]
*  You're asking me like, how would I play Little League [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1962.66s)]
*  To open ended [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1964.66s)]
*  I know 20 things about that person [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1966.66s)]
*  What if you don't? [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1968.66s)]
*  You're saying that you're already reading them by observing them [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1970.66s)]
*  And then based on what you're getting from them [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1972.66s)]
*  You'll formulate the question [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1974.66s)]
*  Well it's like when I'm negotiating real estate [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1976.66s)]
*  And like my transactions, you're like, oh what if he won't take lower [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1978.66s)]
*  I'm like, I know he'll take lower [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1980.66s)]
*  So it's a useful skill in life [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1982.66s)]
*  Outside of that, like do people use it in interrogations? [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1984.66s)]
*  Do lawyers use it? [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1986.66s)]
*  I personally have never done anything like that [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1988.66s)]
*  I've been offered considerable money [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1990.66s)]
*  Time and again by like law firms, various firms [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1992.66s)]
*  To, can you do this for us [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1994.66s)]
*  As a skill that's outside of the guise of entertainment [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1996.66s)]
*  Why don't you do it? [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=1998.66s)]
*  So I haven't done it yet, and I'm going to tell you why [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2000.66s)]
*  There's two reasons, one is it's hard for me to quantify the number [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2002.66s)]
*  Of the tactical advantage I would give you [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2004.66s)]
*  Right now [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2006.66s)]
*  I know that if I go do a show [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2008.66s)]
*  I know how well I'm going to do [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2010.66s)]
*  Like I know that I can deliver [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2012.66s)]
*  I never want to be a guy who doesn't exceed [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2014.66s)]
*  And vastly exceed expectations [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2016.66s)]
*  So if I do that, I'm going to do something where [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2018.66s)]
*  You do a deal and you go, oh my god [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2020.66s)]
*  This guy just knocked out of the park for me [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2022.66s)]
*  And that's going to be word of mouth [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2024.66s)]
*  I think this is doing very well right now [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2026.66s)]
*  So I'm not expanding beyond [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2028.66s)]
*  The book's coming out, but I'll keynote speak [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2030.66s)]
*  But picking juries is not what I decided would be my life's mission [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2032.66s)]
*  But do you think some successful lawyers are using some of these skills? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2034.66s)]
*  I'd be very curious if anyone's using [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2036.66s)]
*  For sure they are [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2038.66s)]
*  I've spoken to them [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2040.66s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2042.66s)]
*  So are they aware that they're doing it? Have they studied it like you? [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2044.66s)]
*  Or is it just part of their communication technique [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2046.66s)]
*  That they've developed throughout their life and it is successful? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2048.66s)]
*  I think there's a Venn diagram overlap [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2050.66s)]
*  Because people have noted [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2052.66s)]
*  That I'm speaking fast, I'm doing stuff [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2054.66s)]
*  Because I can control [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2056.66s)]
*  Based on my pacing [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2058.66s)]
*  See how we slow down, see where you moved [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2060.66s)]
*  What happens in the moment [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2062.66s)]
*  So if there's [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2064.66s)]
*  Not everybody is comfortable at a high speed [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2066.66s)]
*  And when they're uncomfortable, you have way more [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2068.66s)]
*  Control of the interaction [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2070.66s)]
*  Bringing the speed to a level of their comfort [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2072.66s)]
*  You lose control of the interaction [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2074.66s)]
*  Potentially [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2076.66s)]
*  They can also intercept, so when people want to speak [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2078.66s)]
*  What they do, I can normally [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2080.66s)]
*  Speak at this pace, but when I'm going fast [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2082.66s)]
*  And I'm doing something performance wise [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2084.66s)]
*  I know where I'm going to guide you [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2086.66s)]
*  The speed, my voice [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2088.66s)]
*  And they're thinking less [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2090.66s)]
*  I'm moving your mind in the direction [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2092.66s)]
*  I want based on the speed, the words [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2094.66s)]
*  What I'm doing and I'm watching your reactions [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2096.66s)]
*  Know when you're going to where I want [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2098.66s)]
*  At what age do you start developing these [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2100.66s)]
*  Ancillary tools to make the art [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2102.66s)]
*  To take the art to the next level? [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2104.66s)]
*  So I started doing [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2106.66s)]
*  Mentalism more and more [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2108.66s)]
*  I hated mentalism when I was a kid [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2110.66s)]
*  Boring, because I wanted tricks [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2112.66s)]
*  The fun thing about magic [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2114.66s)]
*  Is you can buy a trick, you can practice it [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2116.66s)]
*  And it works, and then you get that reaction [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2118.66s)]
*  I did it as a kid [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2120.66s)]
*  I bought that, there was like some [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2122.66s)]
*  Magic, it was like a VHS [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2124.66s)]
*  Tape, they would send you to break down all the tricks [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2126.66s)]
*  It was fucking incredible [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2128.66s)]
*  I'd write somebody's name [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2130.66s)]
*  Would write on a coin and it would end up being [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2132.66s)]
*  Like a piece of bread at the table [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2134.66s)]
*  And they're like how the fuck did you do it [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2136.66s)]
*  Meaning how it happens, it's kind of [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2138.66s)]
*  It's almost boring for the magician [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2140.66s)]
*  So boring [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2142.66s)]
*  Because it's this one little sleight of hand move [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2144.66s)]
*  And then all this other fluff [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2146.66s)]
*  Once you find out how a magic trick is done, you're so disappointed [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2148.66s)]
*  It's almost like we should never divulge that [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2150.66s)]
*  Because the people that get to witness the magic [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2152.66s)]
*  Lose their joy and wonder [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2154.66s)]
*  You take away the magic [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2156.66s)]
*  You almost feel shame because it's like how did I get tricked [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2158.66s)]
*  For something so simple [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2160.66s)]
*  He's just using the bathroom, we're not doing or setting up any trick [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2162.66s)]
*  It's a number one, it's not a two [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2164.66s)]
*  Everybody knew that [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2166.66s)]
*  Okay, okay, can we do another thing [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2168.66s)]
*  We gotta wait for Tosh, no? [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2170.66s)]
*  Does it make it hard for like [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2172.66s)]
*  Human connection? Because you can pretty much [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2174.66s)]
*  Read people and tell if they're lying to you or trying to mislead you [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2176.66s)]
*  Or can you? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2178.66s)]
*  So, no, people definitely can [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2180.66s)]
*  There's no, it's not a [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2182.66s)]
*  The problem is, the reason you can't just do this [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2184.66s)]
*  In every life, because people are like why don't you take over the world [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2186.66s)]
*  Why is it not a superpower [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2188.66s)]
*  Because it's done [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2190.66s)]
*  Under a certain guise, so people allow [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2192.66s)]
*  Themselves, the same way a hypnotist [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2194.66s)]
*  When a hypnotist hypnotizes you, you can't be hypnotized [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2196.66s)]
*  Against your will [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2198.66s)]
*  You have to submit to it a little bit [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2200.66s)]
*  There has to be some level of suggestibility [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2202.66s)]
*  When a hypnotist does a show in a stage setting [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2204.66s)]
*  They do what's known as compliance testing [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2206.66s)]
*  Everyone in the room, put your hands together [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2208.66s)]
*  They have different ways to see who is acquiescing [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2210.66s)]
*  And it doesn't mean that they're faking it [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2212.66s)]
*  It's really important that you understand, it's not faking it [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2214.66s)]
*  Suggestibility is not faking [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2216.66s)]
*  When those people do those things, like you see some dude [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2218.66s)]
*  Start walking in high heels, clucking like a chicken [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2220.66s)]
*  And then a post hypnotic suggestion, they forgot it [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2222.66s)]
*  That's real, there's no question [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2224.66s)]
*  But they're allowing that [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2226.66s)]
*  Hypnosis is real [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2228.66s)]
*  They don't feel it's real [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2230.66s)]
*  That's not true, I thought that [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2232.66s)]
*  They've calculated this and then certain people are more [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2234.66s)]
*  Hypnotizable than others [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2236.66s)]
*  That couldn't be more true [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2238.66s)]
*  And that's where you're talking about suggestibility and compliance testing [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2240.66s)]
*  Like some people really comply [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2242.66s)]
*  And they go, okay you get up here [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2244.66s)]
*  To answer your question [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2246.66s)]
*  Those people can't just hypnotize you [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2248.66s)]
*  You think, oh if you could do that, why can't you just hypnotize this guy [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2250.66s)]
*  To go kill this guy, give me your money [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2252.66s)]
*  You can't do it in your day to day life [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2254.66s)]
*  Because people won't acquiesce to all the demands [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2256.66s)]
*  So right now if I'm in a setting [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2258.66s)]
*  And let's just make it simple [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2260.66s)]
*  Everyone said to me, why don't you just go to poker [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2262.66s)]
*  And just win poker every single time [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2264.66s)]
*  Because if somebody has cards [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2266.66s)]
*  I now know there's 52 cards [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2268.66s)]
*  All different combinations [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2270.66s)]
*  I have to watch you and say, look at those cards [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2272.66s)]
*  Look at me, think hearts, think diamonds [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2274.66s)]
*  They're not going to do all that [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2276.66s)]
*  I have to put them through [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2278.66s)]
*  If I claim to be psychic [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2280.66s)]
*  Then I'd be full of shit [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2282.66s)]
*  I'm like, yeah why can't you just guess [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2284.66s)]
*  But I'm telling you literally, I'm not psychic [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2286.66s)]
*  I have a set of procedures that I'm putting you through [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2288.66s)]
*  To get to what the answer is [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2290.66s)]
*  And that's probably why specific sales [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2292.66s)]
*  This is a huge advantage [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2294.66s)]
*  Because you are one on one with them [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2296.66s)]
*  And it requires some control [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2298.66s)]
*  I think it requires a tremendous amount of control [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2300.66s)]
*  In a poker game you can't control what they do [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2302.66s)]
*  No, and it's a grind [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2304.66s)]
*  I'm not one on one with certain people playing poker [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2306.66s)]
*  But it's just like you have to have such patience [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2308.66s)]
*  To just go through it and go through it [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2310.66s)]
*  And it's just not in my nature [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2312.66s)]
*  Super ADD, I don't want to sit there and play poker for 8 hours [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2314.66s)]
*  What's up you noodle dicks [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2316.66s)]
*  You see the blue lights, you know what time it is [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2318.66s)]
*  It's time for Blue Chew [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2320.66s)]
*  Hey, it's time for you to step up your sex game [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2322.66s)]
*  There are legal steroids for sex [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2324.66s)]
*  And it's called Blue Chew [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2326.66s)]
*  Same active ingredients as all those other drugs [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2328.66s)]

*  Pardon the pun [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2332.66s)]
*  I'm going to get into this very early on in this podcast [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2334.66s)]
*  Let me explain to you something [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2336.66s)]

*  Your dick probably ain't shit, probably leaves a lot to be desired [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2344.66s)]
*  Al's dick is apparently huge [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2346.66s)]
*  I don't think he knows how to use it [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2348.66s)]
*  But with Blue Chew he can last a lot longer [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2350.66s)]
*  Get harder faster, this guy's old as shit [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2352.66s)]
*  You know he's a black guy who looks like he's 35 [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2354.66s)]
*  That means he's 104 years old [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2356.66s)]
*  Anyway, he needs all the help he can get [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2358.66s)]

*  Let's get back to the show [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2380.66s)]
*  Alright guys, let's take a break for a second [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2382.66s)]
*  Listen, here's a dirty little secret that the insurance industry may want to keep under wraps [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2384.66s)]
*  Insurance companies profit by holding on to your money for as long as possible [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2386.66s)]
*  So after an accident [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2388.66s)]
*  They might do whatever they can to delay or deny your claim [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2390.66s)]
*  This way they can keep those profits growing [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2392.66s)]
*  Morgan & Morgan fights hard against these corporations [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2394.66s)]
*  To fight to make sure you get every dollar you deserve [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2396.66s)]
*  If you're in court for an accident [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2398.66s)]
*  That is someone else's fault [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2400.66s)]
*  The insurance companies just want jurors to think [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2402.66s)]
*  The at fault driver is the one paying the verdict amount [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2404.66s)]
*  So that they award a smaller settlement [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2406.66s)]
*  Nobody wants to make one guy pay millions of dollars [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2408.66s)]
*  He can't afford to pay [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2410.66s)]
*  But they can afford to pay millions of dollars [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2412.66s)]
*  And they can afford to pay millions of dollars [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2414.66s)]
*  And they can afford to pay millions of dollars [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2416.66s)]
*  And they can afford to pay millions of dollars [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2418.66s)]
*  But it's really the insurance companies [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2420.66s)]
*  Who are covering the cost [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2422.66s)]
*  And doing anything they can [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2424.66s)]
*  To make the settlement as small as possible [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2426.66s)]
*  When Morgan & Morgan takes on a case [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2428.66s)]
*  They are almost always going after [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2430.66s)]
*  The big insurance companies and not the individuals [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2432.66s)]
*  That fall Morgan & Morgan [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2434.66s)]
*  Fights hard for their clients and these corporations [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2436.66s)]
*  Know that a recent client in Pennsylvania [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2438.66s)]
*  Just received $29 million [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2440.66s)]
*  Insures best offer before that was $500,000 [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2442.66s)]
*  Another recent client in Florida received $20 million [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2444.66s)]
*  The last offer before that was $0 [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2446.66s)]
*  There's a reason why Morgan & Morgan [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2448.66s)]
*  Is America's largest injury firm [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2450.66s)]
*  Hiring the wrong firm can be disastrous [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2452.66s)]
*  Hiring the right firm could substantially increase [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2454.66s)]
*  Your settlement with Morgan & Morgan [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2456.66s)]
*  It's easy to get started [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2458.66s)]
*  And their fee is free unless they win [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2460.66s)]
*  Just visit forthepeople.com [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2462.66s)]
*  Or dial pound law [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2464.66s)]
*  That is pound 529 [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2466.66s)]
*  That is forthepeople.com [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2468.66s)]
*  Or pound law [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2470.66s)]
*  This is a paid advertisement [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2472.66s)]
*  And now let's get back to the show [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2474.66s)]
*  And they brought them in [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2504.66s)]
*  It was not Dov, it was another young woman [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2506.66s)]
*  Don't let him change books right now [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2508.66s)]
*  Tanya, where are the books that were brought in? [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2510.66s)]
*  These are not my books [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2512.66s)]
*  I don't know whose books these are, do you guys even know? [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2514.66s)]
*  Were these given to you by someone on the show? [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2516.66s)]
*  I don't know who they are [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2518.66s)]
*  Those are our books [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2520.66s)]
*  We have our CIA handler [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2522.66s)]
*  Andrew Bustamante [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2524.66s)]
*  He was awesome [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2526.66s)]
*  He's great, and he has a book coming out [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2528.66s)]
*  This sounds like a big plug [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2530.66s)]
*  And then we also have a War in Harlem [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2532.66s)]
*  Based on true events [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2534.66s)]
*  By Waynesworth Union College [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2536.66s)]
*  Can we get producers here to explain that I have never [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2538.66s)]
*  Set eyes upon these [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2540.66s)]
*  You haven't read War in Harlem? [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2542.66s)]
*  I don't think this is even out yet [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2544.66s)]
*  So I don't know if there's a way you could [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2546.66s)]
*  That's even better, give that to anyone you are right now [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2548.66s)]
*  Hand that to someone, or you can take it [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2550.66s)]
*  I will take it, I would like to be part of this magic [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2552.66s)]
*  Take that book, and is it ok if I take that one for the first time? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2554.66s)]
*  Do you want it? [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2556.66s)]
*  Alright, here's what I'm going to do [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2558.66s)]
*  Let's get teamwork [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2560.66s)]
*  Teamwork makes the dream work [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2562.66s)]
*  I'm going to hold this up [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2564.66s)]
*  Are there pictures on any of the pages? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2566.66s)]
*  If so, I just don't like [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2568.66s)]
*  Is there a lot of pictures? [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2570.66s)]
*  But there's not a ton of pictures, is that right? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2572.66s)]
*  I'm going to flip through this book [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2574.66s)]
*  Whenever you want [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2576.66s)]
*  Mark, you're going to say [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2578.66s)]
*  Stop [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2580.66s)]
*  Right at that moment, stop me [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2582.66s)]
*  If I go one page past [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2584.66s)]
*  You let me know [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2586.66s)]
*  Look at those beautiful eyes [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2588.66s)]
*  This guy either is freezing or angry the whole show [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2590.66s)]
*  No [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2592.66s)]
*  I'm looking over at you, make sure I'm going nice and slow [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=2594.66s)]

*  If I try to be like, still, and not give you anything [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3000.66s)]
*  Is that gonna make your job harder? [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3004.66s)]
*  No, because all it's a toy, it's a victory or an adventure [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3006.66s)]
*  You're gonna be like, bitch [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3008.66s)]
*  Hey, fucking bitch [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3010.66s)]
*  We'll get to the bottom of it [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3014.66s)]
*  You'll do that [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3016.66s)]
*  So you have no time with the books [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3018.66s)]
*  If you have time with the books, I could probably reverse engineer how that happened [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3020.66s)]
*  But if you have no time with the books, then it's like [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3022.66s)]
*  I know, I know [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3024.66s)]
*  I'd figure it out [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3026.66s)]
*  I like how Mark just looked to see if every word in the whole book is Manhattan [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3028.66s)]
*  He's like, no, I got it, I got it [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3032.66s)]
*  I got it, I got it [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3034.66s)]
*  Okay, this is my fucking dumbass brain that is always trying to deconstruct [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3036.66s)]
*  But I would just be like, okay [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3040.66s)]
*  You've looked at both the books [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3042.66s)]
*  You chose the page that I had on here [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3046.66s)]
*  I didn't choose the page, did you not choose the page? [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3048.66s)]
*  No, I didn't choose that page, somebody else chose the page [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3050.66s)]
*  After you said stop, I said stop [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3052.66s)]
*  So wherever we stopped on that page, he just told you to go to that page [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3054.66s)]
*  And to be clear [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3056.66s)]
*  He even said to me, can I pick either page? [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3058.66s)]
*  That's your words, there are two pages [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3060.66s)]
*  Are they the same word on both pages? [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3062.66s)]
*  But the second time you stopped, so there was [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3064.66s)]
*  What is he doing? [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3066.66s)]
*  I know, keep going [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3068.66s)]
*  Can I just get there? [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3070.66s)]
*  So the second time you stopped, the first time there wasn't enough pages [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3072.66s)]
*  The second time you stopped, the word on your page was [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3074.66s)]
*  You guessed, you just guessed [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3076.66s)]
*  No, I thought you guys opened it somewhere in the middle and looked at a book [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3078.66s)]
*  That was totally separate [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3080.66s)]
*  Ah, so you started that one [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3082.66s)]
*  And then the next time you went through, we looked on my page [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3084.66s)]
*  So maybe there's a version where you already knew what the word on 138 was here [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3086.66s)]
*  And you forced Mark to stop at page 138 [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3090.66s)]
*  Because you're so good [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3092.66s)]
*  That's what I would do if I was a magician [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3094.66s)]
*  That's what I would do too, but pick a new page, pick a new word [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3096.66s)]
*  That's why you're not a magician, you know [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3098.66s)]
*  I'm a big skeptic, but that book's not even out [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3100.66s)]
*  You can pre-order it on Amazon [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3102.66s)]
*  Wait, which one? [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3104.66s)]
*  Bustamante gave that to us and dropped it off [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3106.66s)]
*  It's been at the studio for like, a month [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3108.66s)]
*  And he doesn't even look at the fucking book [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3110.66s)]
*  That's unbelievable [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3112.66s)]
*  Alex, what are we messing around with? [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3114.66s)]
*  Go out, get any book you want [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3116.66s)]
*  Anywhere in this place [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3118.66s)]
*  Flip to any page [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3120.66s)]
*  And look at any word, I don't want the first word, I want any word [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3122.66s)]
*  Go [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3124.66s)]
*  Go, go, go, go, go [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3126.66s)]

*  Jerez, hi there bro, look at my face [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3130.66s)]
*  Hey, you little assistant [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3132.66s)]
*  Hey, go, go, go, get some assistant [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3134.66s)]
*  Do something with your life [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3136.66s)]
*  Yo, Mark is so tight that you're not making him the assistant [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3138.66s)]
*  Alright, yes [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3140.66s)]

*  Hold transparency, there's no trick, I just want him out of here [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3144.66s)]
*  The black magic assistant [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3146.66s)]
*  Are you going to do card or what? [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3148.66s)]
*  We need him back for that [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3150.66s)]
*  We need him back for the cards because it's four people [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3152.66s)]
*  I'm sorry if I'm being cynical [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3154.66s)]
*  Is there not a card in all of you that is trying to deconstruct it? [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3156.66s)]
*  No, no, no [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3158.66s)]
*  I don't want to seem like a hater [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3160.66s)]
*  I'm trying to make sense of something that is truly unbelievable [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3162.66s)]
*  I hope you don't feel like I don't appreciate what you've done [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3164.66s)]

*  That's unbelievable [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3178.66s)]

*  It's not out, it's not available [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3182.66s)]
*  How do you fight [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3184.66s)]
*  And pick a word [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3186.66s)]

*  Somewhere in there, interesting [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3190.66s)]
*  Don't even let me say interesting because now that leads to the witness [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3192.66s)]
*  Open any page you want [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3194.66s)]
*  Remember what page number you picked [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3196.66s)]
*  What if I did that already? [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3198.66s)]
*  Oh, you already did all that? Yeah, yeah, yeah [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3200.66s)]

*  The botox is helping [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3218.66s)]
*  You can't move [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3220.66s)]
*  That was unbelievable [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3222.66s)]

*  But it's not available [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3232.66s)]
*  There's no way you can get the book [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3234.66s)]
*  He also called out the number, the page number [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3236.66s)]
*  So how could he have known 138? [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3238.66s)]

*  Can I not have a break, dude? [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3282.66s)]
*  For a magician, this is really not [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3284.66s)]
*  I did more stage elusive [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3286.66s)]

*  Let me ask you [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3434.66s)]
*  Where your phone rings [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3436.66s)]
*  Your phone rings [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3438.66s)]
*  And you vibrate [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3440.66s)]
*  And you're not expecting a call from this person [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3442.66s)]
*  This isn't like your wife told you [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3444.66s)]
*  But you somehow know who it is [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3446.66s)]
*  Have you had that distinct feeling or never? [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3448.66s)]
*  You have not, is that right? [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3450.66s)]
*  You said you have not had that feeling [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3452.66s)]
*  And you say [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3454.66s)]
*  What a weird thing [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3456.66s)]
*  Intuition, instincts, how did I know this person [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3458.66s)]
*  Anytime I'm annoyed by a call, I know it's my wife [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3460.66s)]
*  I get my phone vibrating, I'm like this is annoying [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3462.66s)]
*  I know it's my wife [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3464.66s)]
*  Maybe I have that feeling [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3466.66s)]
*  I said, I'm going to figure this out [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3468.66s)]
*  Imagine a deja vu moment [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3470.66s)]
*  Where you [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3472.66s)]
*  Somehow get a call [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3474.66s)]
*  And you feel you didn't expect to have a vibration [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3476.66s)]
*  And you pick somebody, at random [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3478.66s)]
*  And the phone's calling right now [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3480.66s)]
*  Okay. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3482.66s)]

*  The front? [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3487.66s)]
*  At the top? [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3488.66s)]
*  Very top, very top. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3489.66s)]
*  So I said to you to imagine as if you were getting a call from one person. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3490.66s)]
*  Okay. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3491.66s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3493.66s)]
*  Go to that person, scroll through, find them, and hide it close to you. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3494.66s)]
*  Okay. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3497.66s)]
*  This was picked completely at random. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3498.66s)]
*  Yep. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3499.66s)]
*  This is a totally random person. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3500.66s)]

*  Not by heart, no. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3510.06s)]
*  Nobody knows anybody's phone number, am I right? [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3511.06s)]
*  How many people's phone numbers do you know? [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3512.46s)]

*  All right, guys. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3831.66s)]
*  Let's take a break from this mind-bending interview with Oz, the mentalist. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3832.66s)]
*  And we've got to talk about some deportes, guys. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3840.66s)]
*  We have an unbelievable French open. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3844.18s)]
*  It was the best tennis I've ever seen in my life. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3847.14s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3850.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3851.14s)]
*  And like I said to y'all, I've kind of fallen out with tennis as I got busier, but then [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3852.14s)]
*  I'm watching this and I'm like, I got to get back in. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3854.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3856.8599999999997s)]
*  I don't know if these are the best players ever, like in terms of greatness, but the [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3857.8599999999997s)]
*  level of tennis that is being played on the men's side at the top. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3861.02s)]
*  I've never seen shots hit like this. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3864.2599999999998s)]
*  I've never seen players who have this few weaknesses. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3866.94s)]
*  Have you seen any of the highlights? [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3869.66s)]
*  Yes, I mean, the points are fucking insane. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3870.66s)]
*  Carlos Alcaraz, who is like a Spanish phenom. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3874.1s)]
*  He's got four grand slams, now five going up against Yannick Sinner, who's the best [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3878.06s)]
*  player in the world, but for whatever reason cannot beat Alcaraz. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3881.38s)]
*  He's 0-5 against Alcaraz and then the last three years, like 82 and 3 against everybody [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3885.3399999999997s)]
*  else. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3889.46s)]
*  Some shit like that. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3890.46s)]
*  It's insane. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3891.62s)]
*  Come get this work, man. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3892.62s)]
*  They say my game is like a mix of Alcaraz and Sinner. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3893.62s)]
*  That's what they say. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3895.66s)]
*  That's what they say. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3896.66s)]
*  Do you think you would beat him the first time you played tennis again? [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3900.22s)]
*  It's been like 20 years. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3904.42s)]
*  Yeah, do you think you would beat him the first time? [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3905.42s)]
*  Yes. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3907.42s)]
*  I can't tell you something, I wasn't even that good. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3908.42s)]
*  I couldn't serve. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3911.02s)]
*  I was too short. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3912.02s)]
*  I'm 5'7". [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3913.02s)]
*  Every serve is dog shit. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3914.02s)]
*  I still think I'd beat him. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3915.02s)]
*  Come on, man. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3916.02s)]
*  But he's 5'4", so his serve can't be good. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3917.02s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3919.02s)]
*  It's horrible. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3920.02s)]
*  I'm sure. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3921.02s)]
*  Go get this work. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3922.02s)]
*  Put some money on it. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3923.02s)]
*  That would be worth watching. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3924.02s)]
*  I would watch that. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3925.02s)]
*  Let's bet on it. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3926.02s)]
*  I'd put money on it. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3927.02s)]
*  I think we need to put a little stake bet. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3928.02s)]
*  I don't have an agreement. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3929.38s)]
*  It's going down. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3930.38s)]
*  Yeah, okay, so listen, we also have NBA Finals, right? [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3931.38s)]
*  Oh yeah, NBA Finals. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3935.58s)]
*  That's 1-1 right now. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3936.94s)]
*  Tied up. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3937.94s)]
*  I guess when this comes out, it will be... [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3938.94s)]
*  Game three will be coming on that night, Wednesday. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3940.58s)]
*  Okay, so what are we thinking for that? [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3942.58s)]
*  Man, I hope the Pacers win. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3944.3s)]
*  I love the Pacers. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3945.74s)]
*  I think OKC's got it. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3946.74s)]
*  I think OKC's just, yeah. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3947.74s)]
*  I'm amazed they lost game one. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3949.3s)]
*  But again, I didn't think the Pacers would win the last round. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3950.7s)]
*  The Pacers are a weird team. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3953.7s)]
*  They either beat you or get blown out. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3954.9s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like it. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3957.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3959.4599999999996s)]
*  Every time they lose, they seem to get blown out. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3960.4599999999996s)]
*  And you're like, yeah, now we're coming back to reality. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3962.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3964.2999999999997s)]
*  And I don't know if it's Rick Carlyle or what. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3965.2999999999997s)]
*  The adjustments are crazy. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3966.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3967.8599999999997s)]
*  I mean, just like, I think he's one of the best coaches of all time. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3968.8599999999997s)]
*  So what do you think happens? [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3972.5s)]
*  I think OKC wins, but I don't think it's... [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3973.8199999999997s)]
*  I doubt myself as I say that, because I'm like, dude, I don't know. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3976.5s)]
*  The Pacers just keep proving me wrong. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3978.9399999999996s)]
*  We got to see what the Pacers do at home. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3980.2599999999998s)]
*  That's for sure. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3981.9799999999996s)]
*  We got to see what they do at home. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3982.9799999999996s)]
*  But I wouldn't be surprised. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3983.9799999999996s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3985.58s)]
*  Son, this kid, Shea is nice, too. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3986.74s)]
*  People hate on him, but he's nice. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3988.9s)]
*  Don't hate. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3989.9s)]
*  He's nice. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3990.9s)]
*  I get it. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3991.9s)]
*  Like, you're like, what is it called? [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3992.9s)]
*  Milk and calls or whatever? [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3993.9s)]
*  Yeah, free throw merchant is what they call him. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3994.9s)]
*  But still, even without that, he's filthy. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3996.02s)]
*  And I find it less annoying than what I've seen. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=3998.58s)]
*  I haven't watched as much this year, but what Harden used to do was so floppy and all over [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4001.86s)]
*  the place. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4005.86s)]
*  I don't think Shea's that bad. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4006.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4007.86s)]
*  He seems to go to the rim a lot. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4008.86s)]
*  He'll still put it up. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4009.86s)]
*  He'll try to draw the foul, but not like to an insane degree. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4010.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4012.2599999999998s)]
*  Not on that euro shit. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4013.2599999999998s)]
*  No, his game is awesome. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4014.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4015.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't know why I really root against OKC, but they're so good. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4016.42s)]
*  Yeah, we might have to give it up to that organization. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4019.5400000000004s)]
*  They've done an amazing job of building up, rebuilding, rebuilding. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4021.86s)]
*  This is... [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4026.98s)]
*  All about being cheap. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4027.98s)]
*  That's the reason they traded, was it Harden the first time? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4030.6200000000003s)]
*  They didn't want to pay for one year, basically, of maybe being on the luxury tax. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4033.0200000000004s)]
*  And they still keep doing it. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4037.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4038.6600000000003s)]
*  No, they got to, we got to look into that. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4039.6600000000003s)]
*  Who runs that team? [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4040.7000000000003s)]
*  Sam Presti. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4041.7000000000003s)]
*  With Presti, right? [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4042.7000000000003s)]
*  Came from the Spurs. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4043.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4045.14s)]
*  Because they've done a phenomenal job. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4046.14s)]
*  Anyway, Stake is a leader in global betting and a U.S. social casino. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4047.14s)]
*  He's been on top of sports and political events. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4050.02s)]
*  He used the promo code flagrant for your welcome bonus. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4051.74s)]
*  Let's get back to our boy, Ose. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4054.22s)]
*  All right. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4055.9399999999996s)]
*  I got it. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4056.9399999999996s)]
*  All right. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4057.9399999999996s)]
*  Come back. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4059.62s)]
*  Have a seat for me. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4060.62s)]
*  Hiding, hiding, hiding. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4061.62s)]
*  Just knocking. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4064.62s)]
*  Alex was told to think of, to write down, I said, write down what page you went to in [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4067.62s)]
*  the book. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4074.26s)]
*  Is that correct? [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4075.26s)]
*  Yes. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4076.26s)]
*  Yeah, hold on. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4077.26s)]
*  You had picked the page number earlier, was 138. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4078.26s)]
*  But you said maybe I've gone through the book, but we know it's pre-release. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4079.42s)]
*  So I couldn't know what book this is. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4083.82s)]
*  But you've written down the page number. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4085.42s)]
*  So if you gave that note to him, he could go to that page. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4087.0200000000004s)]
*  And what are the odds he picks the same word? [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4089.7000000000003s)]
*  What do you think are the odds he picks the same word if he even knew the page? [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4091.1000000000004s)]
*  It's probably high. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4093.38s)]
*  Really? [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4094.38s)]
*  How could that be? [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4095.38s)]
*  Aren't there a ton of words? [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4096.38s)]
*  Take the note. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4098.62s)]
*  Forget it. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4099.62s)]
*  You're not getting it. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4100.62s)]
*  You're not getting any word on it. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4101.98s)]
*  Rip the note off. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4102.98s)]
*  He thinks they cover. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4103.98s)]
*  Alex! [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4104.98s)]
*  Go out. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4105.98s)]
*  Go out. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4106.98s)]
*  I was going to let you show it to him. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4107.98s)]
*  Maybe I'm throwing him off. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4108.98s)]
*  Take the note, rip it into shreds. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4109.98s)]
*  Rip the note. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4110.98s)]
*  Yeah, because I was going to let you show it to him, but I thought you'd say no way [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4111.98s)]
*  would he pick the same word. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4112.98s)]
*  Rip it up, rip it up. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4113.98s)]
*  And full transparency, I said make up a word out of your mind that wasn't in the book that [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4114.98s)]
*  just came to you. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4116.98s)]
*  Is that correct? [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4117.98s)]
*  Yes. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4118.98s)]
*  That was the same word, right? [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4119.98s)]
*  You're not getting it. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4120.98s)]
*  What are the odds he picks the same word if he even knew the page number? [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4121.98s)]
*  And what are the odds he picks the same word if he even knew the page number? [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4122.98s)]

*  just came to you. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4129.9s)]
*  Is that correct? [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4130.9s)]
*  Yes. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4131.9s)]
*  That's written up there too? [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4132.9s)]
*  Throw it away. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4133.9s)]
*  So now we're done. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4134.9s)]
*  Now I thought we'd let you go to the same page and see if somehow your mind's connected. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4135.9s)]
*  But no, now he says you're going to only word on the page. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4138.66s)]
*  All right. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4142.299999999999s)]
*  Look behind you at how many pages are in the book. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4147.379999999999s)]
*  I won't look. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4148.86s)]
*  Look at how many pages are in the book. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4149.86s)]
*  This book. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4150.86s)]
*  You did it. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4151.86s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4152.86s)]
*  Most books are between 280 and 350. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4153.86s)]
*  Okay. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4154.86s)]
*  Is it between 280 and 350? [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4155.86s)]
*  No. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4156.86s)]
*  Oh, good outlier. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4157.86s)]
*  Probably went with less. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4158.86s)]
*  Probably went with less. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4159.86s)]
*  Hide the book. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4160.86s)]
*  Hide the book. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4161.86s)]
*  Why you say that? [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4162.86s)]
*  Is he hidden? [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4163.86s)]
*  He would choose that book because he'd... [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4164.86s)]
*  I think he probably did a smaller book. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4165.86s)]
*  Try to screw with me. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4166.86s)]
*  Thank you, chips. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4167.86s)]
*  Who knows this person who wrote it? [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4168.86s)]
*  Look at that familiarity. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4169.86s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4170.86s)]

*  I don't know. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4179.86s)]
*  You went to any book, you challenged me. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4180.86s)]
*  You went and got any book, is that correct? [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4181.86s)]
*  Yes. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4182.86s)]
*  You went to any page, you picked any word, and you look stiff AF right now. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4183.86s)]
*  And you thought of a word. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4184.86s)]
*  I'm never going to get the word that was in the book. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4185.86s)]
*  That's impossible. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4186.86s)]
*  We know that. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4187.86s)]
*  Andrew's already figured it out. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4188.86s)]
*  But how could I get all this other stuff? [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4189.86s)]
*  Are your nails painted? [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4190.86s)]
*  I just noticed that. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4191.86s)]
*  He's calling you gay. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4192.86s)]
*  Book was less than 280, wasn't it? [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4193.86s)]
*  Yes. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4194.86s)]
*  And you never got that book. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4195.86s)]
*  So you never got that book. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4196.86s)]
*  That's a good question. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4197.86s)]
*  All right. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4198.86s)]
*  Okay. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4199.86s)]

*  Person, person. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4211.219999999999s)]
*  You keep trying to look at him. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4212.299999999999s)]
*  They host the podcast together. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4214.54s)]
*  Fucked. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4215.54s)]
*  Charlamagne the God. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4216.54s)]
*  Is that who the person wrote the book? [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4217.54s)]
*  Yes. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4218.54s)]
*  You picked the easiest shit in the world, yo. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4219.54s)]
*  What the fuck are you doing? [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4220.54s)]
*  Think of the page. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4221.54s)]
*  Think 150, 160, 170, 180. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4222.54s)]
*  It was just around 200 words and it went blah, blah, blah, blah. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4223.54s)]
*  And you flipped in the middle and you went back three pages. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4228.32s)]
*  91. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4230.9s)]

*  Yes. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4232.94s)]
*  And then do you know what he looks like to me? [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4233.94s)]
*  He looks like somebody who's thinking of a word. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4237.9s)]
*  But he also looks like he's trying to hold something. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4244.0199999999995s)]
*  He's trying to hold in a fart. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4245.42s)]

*  It's a deja vu. It's like an exercise. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4400.58s)]
*  Where you walk out of here, okay, [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4402.58s)]

*  You're gonna play this through in your head. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4408.58s)]
*  You've done this before. I know you have. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4410.58s)]
*  In fact, if we're being legit, you've probably done this a hundred times. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4412.58s)]
*  You walk into a bodega, right? [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4414.58s)]
*  You walk up and down the aisles. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4416.58s)]
*  And you look. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4418.58s)]
*  Over here are snacks, right? [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4420.58s)]
*  We've got healthy snacks. We've got candy. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4422.58s)]
*  We've got beverages. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4424.58s)]
*  And you're going back and forth, and your fingers graze stuff. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4426.58s)]
*  And this is when you reach up, [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4428.58s)]
*  and this is really important. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4430.58s)]
*  You open up, or you reach down, and you grab one thing, [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4432.58s)]
*  you bring it to the counter, [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4434.58s)]
*  and you get ready to swipe your card. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4436.58s)]
*  Close your eyes. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4438.58s)]
*  Can you see this playing out in your mind? [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4440.58s)]
*  Can you act this out and see yourself doing it? [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4442.58s)]
*  Okay, are you sitting? I want you to be comfortable. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4444.58s)]

*  this was a random choice. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4448.58s)]
*  Also, for you gentlemen, I like to have a visual. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4450.58s)]
*  I want to bring scrabble tiles. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4452.58s)]
*  I forgot them at home. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4454.58s)]
*  It's not part of the show. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4456.58s)]
*  Literally, my kids have them. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4458.58s)]
*  So each of you gentlemen, you're going to reach in your right pocket. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4460.58s)]
*  Right now, feel what's in your pocket. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4462.58s)]
*  Nothing, right? [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4464.58s)]
*  No, Andrew, you're good. You're good. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4466.58s)]
*  But I had you pretend. The pretend is that you reach in, [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4468.58s)]
*  and you grab out, and you have one scrabble tile in your pocket. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4470.58s)]
*  Grab it out, and I want you to hold it in your hand as if you could see it. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4472.58s)]
*  As if you could see it. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4474.58s)]
*  Ready? [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4476.58s)]
*  Okay, it's good. I'm going to give you each a marker, [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4478.58s)]
*  and I don't want to see what you write, [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4480.58s)]
*  but I want you, is it okay if you write something with a marker on your hand? [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4482.58s)]
*  Sure. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4484.58s)]
*  I want you to write down that scrabble tile. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4486.58s)]
*  And just for the record, these are consonants. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4488.58s)]
*  I want to make sure they're consonant, not vowels. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4490.58s)]
*  Is that your consonant? [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4492.58s)]
*  It should be, yeah, it's consonant. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4494.58s)]
*  That was cause my mother fucking just read me, bro. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4496.58s)]
*  You thought Al wouldn't do it. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4498.58s)]
*  I was going to write Europe. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4500.58s)]
*  Australia. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4502.58s)]
*  Ha ha ha. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4504.58s)]
*  I'm not judging you based on you thinking of the word fart out of the hole in this language. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4506.58s)]
*  Alright. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4512.58s)]
*  I don't want to see it. Write down your letter [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4514.58s)]
*  in your hand, and hold it close. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4516.58s)]
*  Hold it close. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4518.58s)]
*  Is this marker too thick for you? [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4520.58s)]
*  No. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4522.58s)]
*  You like to think this. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4524.58s)]
*  I can't see, or can I see? [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4526.58s)]
*  You're going to see at the end. You're going to make a word. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4528.58s)]
*  This is what I told you at the beginning. Remember, full circle. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4530.58s)]
*  I said the best comedians can take a subject, infertility, and make it hilarious. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4532.58s)]
*  That's a gift. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4534.58s)]
*  And I don't want to see it. Write yours in your left palm so I don't see it. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4536.58s)]
*  And that's right yours. This thing's never coming off, by the way. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4544.58s)]
*  They're going to get a buzz just from this soaking through there. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4546.58s)]
*  This has been dipped in LSD, boys. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4548.58s)]
*  It's about to be a fun night. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4550.58s)]
*  Oh, hell yeah. That'd be fire. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4552.58s)]
*  Okay, you each did it. Close to your heart. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4554.58s)]
*  Here is where it gets good. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4556.58s)]
*  You're going to fill in the blanks. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4558.58s)]
*  Can't really form a word without vowels. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4560.58s)]
*  Unless it's Polish. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4562.58s)]
*  So they're going to show you from left to right. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4564.58s)]
*  They're going to show you their hands, and you're going to form a word. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4566.58s)]
*  You get to put in vowels in the middle. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4568.58s)]
*  I don't know how many vowels you're going to use, but form a word. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4570.58s)]
*  Based on these three letters that they picked at random. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4572.58s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait until I'm gone. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4574.58s)]
*  Starting with the kosh. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4576.58s)]
*  Getting close to a mark, and then last, go ahead and show them your hand as well. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4578.58s)]
*  Show them your hand. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4580.58s)]
*  You guys get it? [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4582.58s)]
*  From left to right, I want you to see the same way you would read from left to right. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4584.58s)]
*  Look at those three letters. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4586.58s)]
*  Did you see Akash's? Did you see Mark's? [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4588.58s)]
*  Did you see Alex's? [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4590.58s)]
*  Have you done that? [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4592.58s)]
*  I'm praying because most of the time you can make some sort of word out of it. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4594.58s)]
*  Do you have a word that you made out of that? [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4596.58s)]
*  I can add vowels. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4598.58s)]
*  In the middle. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4600.58s)]
*  I got one. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4602.58s)]
*  If not, there might be different ones. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4604.58s)]
*  It's like boggle. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4606.58s)]
*  Here's where this gets good. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4608.58s)]
*  Just draw the word. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4612.58s)]
*  Kiana. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4614.58s)]
*  Adeli has over 500 things usually. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4616.58s)]
*  Like a bodega. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4618.58s)]
*  Are you good? [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4620.58s)]
*  Yeah, I just want to make sure it was a word. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4622.58s)]
*  Is it not a word? [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4624.58s)]
*  Yeah, it's a word. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4626.58s)]
*  Did you see how when I was talking about the choices I said salty? [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4628.58s)]
*  I said sweet. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4630.58s)]
*  I said beverages. I did all sorts of things. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4632.58s)]
*  And I rushed through one of them. You asked me how I do it. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4634.58s)]
*  And I rushed and I noticed, be honest, that I saw you micro nod. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4636.58s)]
*  Beverage. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4638.58s)]
*  You thought of a beverage, didn't you? Am I right? [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4640.58s)]
*  Yes. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4642.58s)]
*  You didn't realize it. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4644.58s)]
*  Tell us all. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4646.58s)]

*  What did you pick? What did you buy out of the whole deli? [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4650.58s)]
*  Fanta. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4652.58s)]
*  And you guys did FNT. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4654.58s)]
*  Did you think of Fanta also? [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4656.58s)]
*  No. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4658.58s)]

*  that you created them? [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4868.58s)]
*  I have a very good sense [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4870.58s)]
*  of how to put things together. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4872.58s)]
*  I call it Fiji water. I can repackage. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4874.58s)]
*  Water in a bottle. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4876.58s)]
*  Shouldn't have made people billionaires, but it did. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4878.58s)]
*  Why? The feeling you got. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4880.58s)]
*  The visuals, the images, the whole story, the whole thing. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4882.58s)]
*  The more you're going to think about that one, I hope you spend a day or two, [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4884.58s)]
*  it's going to get crazier and crazier [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4886.58s)]
*  to think that she could have picked Fanta, [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4888.58s)]
*  she could have picked any letters. All of it combines. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4890.58s)]
*  All meant to be. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4892.58s)]
*  I think that that's what's fun about it, is that you don't see where it's going. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4894.58s)]
*  How the fuck did you guys [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4896.58s)]
*  not pick different letters? [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4898.58s)]
*  That's what I don't understand. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4900.58s)]
*  How did he get me to the L? How did he get me to the G? [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4902.58s)]
*  How did he get you to the R? How did he get her to the Fanta? [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4904.58s)]
*  You guys just chose whatever letter. You wrote it on your hand. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4906.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4908.58s)]
*  I'm telling you, you know what the craziest part is? [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4910.58s)]
*  Would the white woman have picked a Fanta? I don't think so. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4912.58s)]
*  I think you went to the minority on purpose. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4914.58s)]
*  First Mark Luther King, then this. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4918.58s)]
*  Frankly, I'm offended by the show. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4920.58s)]
*  Are you doing a different set? [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4924.58s)]
*  You have to do a different set. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4926.58s)]
*  From my corporate set and what I do for, air quotes, a living, [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4928.58s)]
*  when I'm doing events, I typically have an A show, B show, [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4930.58s)]
*  and I don't want to call it a C show because we're going to be like, [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4932.58s)]
*  C show, but it's just different material. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4934.58s)]
*  We live in an era where I don't need to [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4936.58s)]
*  change what I do very often. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4938.58s)]
*  Comedians have a much higher level of like, [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4940.58s)]
*  Every time we're in a market. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4942.58s)]
*  Well, you've got to, you burn a special, it's gone. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4944.58s)]
*  But when you come on a pod, [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4946.58s)]
*  so you can do maybe a variation of this [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4948.58s)]
*  that has the same tools, [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4950.58s)]
*  but they have to present themselves differently. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4952.58s)]
*  I've seen a lot of your stuff. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4954.58s)]
*  I haven't seen you repeating it. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4956.58s)]
*  But if you don't crack the code, you're down to see him do it twice. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4958.58s)]
*  I watch you do this 14 more times, [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4960.58s)]
*  and if it was Fanta, I wouldn't even care. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4962.58s)]
*  Next one's Grape Soda. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4964.58s)]
*  That one's a great one. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4966.58s)]
*  Have you ever done an effect on someone [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4972.58s)]
*  and they're intentionally obstructive, [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4974.58s)]
*  and how do you handle that? [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4976.58s)]
*  It's always the best. I went in one time, [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4978.58s)]
*  and I did The Bengals. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4980.58s)]
*  I did Joe Burrow and The Bengals, which is one of my most viral clips. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4982.58s)]
*  And he wasn't, [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4984.58s)]
*  this is really funny because a guy hit me up on Facebook Messenger, [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4986.58s)]
*  and he told me he was in the grocery store with Joe Burrow. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4988.58s)]
*  And he's like, [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4990.58s)]
*  I have to share this to you. I was with Joe, [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4992.58s)]
*  and he told me, Joe, we're talking about it. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4994.58s)]
*  And he goes, oh, I saw this mentalist. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4996.58s)]
*  I'm a huge fan of his. Do you remember him? [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=4998.58s)]
*  He goes, remember him. He goes, I spent eight months trying to figure out how the hell he did that to me. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5000.58s)]
*  And I thought I knew how he did it. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5002.58s)]
*  And then at the Super Bowl, [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5004.58s)]
*  I saw him backstage, and he did something else to me, [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5006.58s)]
*  and I realized I had no idea. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5008.58s)]
*  And everything I thought was completely like, I had this theory, [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5010.58s)]
*  and it was all wrong. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5012.58s)]
*  Because he did it to me again, but with nothing. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5014.58s)]
*  What do you do, I think, what Mark is asking, when someone lies? [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5016.58s)]
*  It's important to understand. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5018.58s)]
*  So that got into his head, but I never was able to meet Joe Burrow before. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5020.58s)]
*  So most people think, [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5022.58s)]
*  which I go in fresh to most of these things. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5024.58s)]
*  I'll do an event with 5,000 people. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5026.58s)]
*  I didn't meet all these people. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5028.58s)]
*  You can't throw a frisbee to somebody, 26 rows, [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5030.58s)]
*  they stand up, I guess the name of their dog when they were seven, [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5032.58s)]
*  and have set that up. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5034.58s)]
*  Unless you think that I got Tom Brady throwing frisbees. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5036.58s)]
*  How could that be? [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5038.58s)]
*  So it's not set up. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5040.58s)]
*  You have to be able to do this with anybody, [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5042.58s)]
*  or you'll run out of career really quick. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5044.58s)]
*  But with Burrow, I was not allowed to see him. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5046.58s)]
*  I was told he would not be in the show. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5048.58s)]
*  So they literally said to me, kind of the PR, [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5050.58s)]
*  Joe doesn't want to be in, he doesn't want to do it. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5052.58s)]
*  And I go, okay, let me do what I do, you do what you do. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5054.58s)]
*  I'm going to get in there, I'm going to get everyone fired up, [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5056.58s)]
*  I'm going to get them excited, [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5058.58s)]
*  I'm going to show that he's the leader, the team wants him to do it. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5060.58s)]
*  And he's going to buy them. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5062.58s)]
*  I guarantee you, same way that I walked up to tables at Zia's when I was 14, [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5064.58s)]
*  and people that wanted nothing to do with me, [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5066.58s)]
*  two minutes later, when I'm leaving, [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5068.58s)]
*  are like, please stay. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5070.58s)]
*  That's the best feeling in the world. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5072.58s)]
*  You don't want me, now you don't want to let me go. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5074.58s)]
*  And so that's how you win over an audience, [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5076.58s)]
*  both in entertainment and anything you do [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5078.58s)]
*  in the attention economy. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5080.58s)]
*  So I got him up, and that was something [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5082.58s)]
*  where I told, when I was on Joe Rogan, [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5084.58s)]
*  he's like, how long were you planning that? [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5086.58s)]
*  I go, two years, Joe. Two years I was thinking [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5088.58s)]
*  how I was going to execute the ultimate football trick, [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5090.58s)]
*  which is, quarterback, all my eligible receivers stand up, [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5092.58s)]
*  look at them, look at me, and I tell you who he's going to throw the ball to every time. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5094.58s)]
*  I saw the Josh Allen one. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5096.58s)]
*  Yeah, the Josh Allen was crazy. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5098.58s)]
*  Unbelievable. Thank you. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5100.58s)]
*  Okay, so two years you're planning the execution of that trick. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5102.58s)]
*  So that means right now, you are planning a trick [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5104.58s)]
*  that might come to fruition five years from now. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5106.58s)]
*  Yeah, if not five years, I don't have that kind of scale right now, [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5108.58s)]
*  because I'm so busy. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5110.58s)]
*  So again, it's not going to be a good problem to have, [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5112.58s)]
*  but I just have so much coming up. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5114.58s)]
*  But is there somebody that you're planning a trick for [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5116.58s)]
*  that you can let us know that has been in... [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5118.58s)]
*  The home, so I'm going to let you know. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5120.58s)]
*  The home, so I'm going to let you know. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5122.58s)]
*  For how long have you been working on this one? [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5124.58s)]
*  I met him two years ago, and I've been pretty much planning it since, [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5126.58s)]
*  and I know what I'm going to do. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5128.58s)]
*  Wow. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5130.58s)]
*  So viral. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5132.58s)]
*  And is there a specific thing? [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5134.58s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5136.58s)]
*  Okay. Do you have a plan [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5138.58s)]
*  when that's going to come to fruition? [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5140.58s)]
*  Knock on wood. If they see this, hopefully this summer. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5142.58s)]
*  Wow. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5144.58s)]
*  Yo, Pat, come on, flag her in the game. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5146.58s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5148.58s)]
*  holy fucking... [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5150.58s)]
*  I saw a clip, and I think you were on the Joe Budden podcast. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5152.58s)]
*  I was on Joe Budden. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5154.58s)]
*  And you did a... [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5156.58s)]
*  You guessed the producer's [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5158.58s)]
*  nickname for his friend or something. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5160.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5162.58s)]
*  Challenged me, too. He's like, I don't call him that. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5164.58s)]
*  I go, you don't call him that? He goes, no one will call him. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5166.58s)]
*  And I nailed it. How? [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5168.58s)]
*  How? Elders? [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5170.58s)]
*  See to God. I mean, how? There's a lot of hows so far. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5172.58s)]
*  You know what I do like about what you do? [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5174.58s)]
*  I think what magicians did when we were growing up [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5176.58s)]
*  and what the mentalists... [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5178.58s)]
*  We had a mentalist at a restaurant that we were all eating at, [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5180.58s)]
*  the three of us. And we figured out his shit [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5182.58s)]
*  within like three minutes. But it was a lot of like... [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5184.58s)]
*  Hopefully I need three hours. Three hours for me. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5186.58s)]
*  They sell this illusion of magic. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5188.58s)]
*  Oh, this is a mystical thing. We're all connected. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5190.58s)]
*  Whatever thing they use is like a... [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5192.58s)]
*  You don't do that, which I like. You break K-Fabe. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5194.58s)]
*  Yeah. They don't break the K-Fabe. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5196.58s)]
*  It's like, wrestling is real. That's what they're doing [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5198.58s)]
*  with a lot of magicians, which is also cool [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5200.58s)]
*  because you want to submit yourself to this. But I think [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5202.58s)]
*  because you don't have the props... [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5204.58s)]
*  It almost makes it more impressive. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5206.58s)]
*  And it's less like I have to... I don't have to submit myself [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5208.58s)]
*  to this idea that magic exists. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5210.58s)]
*  I just submit myself to the idea that [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5212.58s)]
*  there's someone who's really fucking good at reading [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5214.58s)]
*  people and situations and whatever, and that's an [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5216.58s)]
*  insanely unique, cool skill to have. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5218.58s)]
*  That's all I have to say. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5220.58s)]
*  I have a transferable skill. Some people always ask me, [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5222.58s)]
*  were you born this way? And I go, absolutely not. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5224.58s)]
*  I've learned... I feel like I'm not showing you any love. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5226.58s)]
*  I keep looking at that one. Sorry guys. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5228.58s)]
*  Mark's scared of me still. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5230.58s)]
*  Even though he hurt my feelings, like I'm a cop feel guy, [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5232.58s)]
*  not a mentalist guy. He's caught me deep, Mark Agnon. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5234.58s)]
*  So I fully, again, [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5238.58s)]
*  not to hype the book, but I figured out [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5240.58s)]
*  over years, because I get asked the same questions [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5242.58s)]
*  all the time, which is how do you do this? How can I learn this? [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5244.58s)]
*  And I go, you don't actually want to learn this. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5246.58s)]
*  And be like, what do you mean? I do. And I go, no you don't. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5248.58s)]
*  Because let's say I showed you how to [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5250.58s)]
*  have someone pick a dollar bill [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5252.58s)]
*  and have it be the phone number of somebody I just thought of. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5254.58s)]
*  And I was like, well, why would you do that? Well, I really wouldn't do that [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5256.58s)]
*  because I'm not an entertainer. I go, well, what do you do for a living? [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5258.58s)]
*  And I go, well, customer [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5260.58s)]
*  success manager to start up. I go, great. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5262.58s)]
*  What would you like to achieve in the next two years? I want to get a raise. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5264.58s)]
*  I want to do this. I'm going to show you how to do that. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5266.58s)]
*  And I'm going to make your percent change of doing that [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5268.58s)]
*  50, 60, 70 percent higher. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5270.58s)]
*  Because what is all about relationships? [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5272.58s)]
*  How to read people? How to utilize [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5274.58s)]
*  kind of knowledge for that? [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5276.58s)]
*  Like how do you walk in the room and take [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5278.58s)]
*  charge? The same thing I'm doing, if you could do it in your [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5280.58s)]
*  life, not performing, I assure [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5282.58s)]
*  you, you would see major results. Yeah, and then [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5284.58s)]
*  the scale of what you do monetarily is probably way [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5286.58s)]
*  higher because a sales company will be like, [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5288.58s)]
*  I'll pay this guy whatever. You know what I mean? [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5290.58s)]
*  Well, how do you know when you approach somebody to ask for a raise? [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5292.58s)]
*  That's such a simple question. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5294.58s)]
*  But if you go to them on a Monday after they went on vacation, [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5296.58s)]
*  they're all, timing is everything in [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5298.58s)]
*  life, something I learned so early on. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5300.58s)]
*  When do I hold on? You ask me, am I [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5302.58s)]
*  waiting? Yeah, I'll wait two years. I'll wait four years. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5304.58s)]
*  But when I do that thing from home, it's going to be mega viral [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5306.58s)]
*  because it's all about [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5308.58s)]
*  picking your moment. And I think I learned that in restaurants, [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5310.58s)]
*  I learned that in other parts of life, but that [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5312.58s)]
*  skill applies to everyone and everything. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5314.58s)]
*  So the Joe Burrow thing, did you put it off? You got an [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5316.58s)]
*  opportunity before that and you said no? [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5318.58s)]
*  Or was it just that the opportunity took two years? [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5320.58s)]
*  The opportunity took two years and I also didn't [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5322.58s)]
*  burn it on someone else because I could have tried [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5324.58s)]
*  to. But Joe Burrow is [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5326.58s)]
*  notoriously media shy. Not knocking, he's [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5328.58s)]
*  just a shy guy. If you actually meet him, he's [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5330.58s)]
*  super nice. Very likeable thing actually. Very likeable, [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5332.58s)]
*  but very, he's just not, [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5334.58s)]
*  some guys in front of the camera are boisterous. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5336.58s)]
*  He doesn't really give a lot off. So when [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5338.58s)]
*  you see him losing his mind, [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5340.58s)]
*  he also signed a $275 million [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5342.58s)]
*  contract the day before that hit. So [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5344.58s)]
*  everyone in the comments, my best comment, the one that got run up [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5346.58s)]
*  with like 30,000 likes, was some guy goes, [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5348.58s)]
*  dude, he paid him off. And I go, I wish [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5350.58s)]
*  to God I had enough money to pay off Joe Burrow [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5352.58s)]
*  to do this after his $275 [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5354.58s)]
*  million contract. Mike Trapp. I was like, [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5356.58s)]
*  I wish. There's no paying him off. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5358.58s)]
*  Is that frustrating to you at all? No, I love that. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5360.58s)]
*  People trying to discredit? That's the [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5362.58s)]
*  number one thing you could say. People say this [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5364.58s)]
*  was staged. That's the biggest compliment. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5366.58s)]
*  The biggest compliment there is. And it's also the funniest [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5368.58s)]
*  because I've had hundreds of [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5370.58s)]
*  TV appearances. Have I staged it with [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5372.58s)]
*  every single person? Did I find [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5374.58s)]
*  some way to get a billionaire [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5376.58s)]
*  to do this and Andrew Schultz to do this [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5378.58s)]
*  and Joe Rogan to pretend he gave me his pin code? [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5380.58s)]
*  I use racism to guess things about [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5382.58s)]
*  audience members on stage sometimes. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5384.58s)]
*  They'll accuse me of being staged. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5386.58s)]
*  He's going to start doing a beverage thing [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5388.58s)]
*  where he goes whiskey, Fanta. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5390.58s)]
*  I can tell you right now who's picking what. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5392.58s)]
*  He just looked at me on [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5394.58s)]
*  kombucha. It was very offensive. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5396.58s)]
*  I live in Brooklyn, but I'm not Brooklyn, bro. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5398.58s)]
*  Do you remember the first magic trick you ever learned? 100%. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5400.58s)]
*  What was it? And can you do it? [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5402.58s)]
*  I don't do it anymore because it's a gimmick. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5404.58s)]
*  It's a trick deck, which I don't want [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5406.58s)]
*  to reveal, but when you're younger [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5408.58s)]
*  you start learning with trick [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5410.58s)]
*  things. It's kind of a magic trick. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5412.58s)]
*  The quarter that bends. It looks like you can bite it. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5414.58s)]
*  You learn the trick because the thing is the trick. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5416.58s)]
*  If I gave it to you, you could do the [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5418.58s)]
*  same trick. Versus if I gave you [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5420.58s)]
*  two books, you could not do the same [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5422.58s)]
*  trick as The Hope. I am the trick. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5424.58s)]
*  So I am the show. I could get [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5426.58s)]
*  dropped off with no luggage and do a show for 5,000 people [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5428.58s)]
*  by going to Staples for 10 minutes. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5430.58s)]
*  That's where I want to be. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5432.58s)]
*  I don't want people to think that box. When I see [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5434.58s)]
*  Copperfield, love Copperfield, but I go [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5436.58s)]
*  if I had that box, could I do that [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5438.58s)]
*  thing? That's the thought that goes in my head. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5440.58s)]
*  I'm like you. I'm just like you. I want to figure out [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5442.58s)]
*  how the hell it works. And that's how I became [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5444.58s)]
*  a mentalist. In recent times, has [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5446.58s)]
*  anyone ever figured out how you did the trick? [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5448.58s)]
*  Like right after you did it? If you're on YouTube [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5450.58s)]
*  it's just like the power of the internet. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5452.58s)]
*  Somebody will dissect it, [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5454.58s)]
*  but it's amazing [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5456.58s)]
*  because 99% of them are wrong [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5458.58s)]
*  and they're so entertaining to listen to. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5460.58s)]
*  But then you always find that one hidden one that has no [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5462.58s)]
*  uplikes. And I'm like, yep. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5464.58s)]
*  Everything right. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5466.58s)]
*  Boom, boom, boom. Here's what you did. Here's what you did. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5468.58s)]
*  You misdirected them here. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5470.58s)]
*  This is when you did that. At 2.30 [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5472.58s)]
*  you said that one thing. He knew that. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5474.58s)]
*  And then I'm like, yo, this is [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5476.58s)]
*  you know what you're talking about. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5478.58s)]
*  So in YouTube there's enough consolidation of people. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5480.58s)]
*  But in a show, on [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5482.58s)]
*  stage, it's impossible. Because [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5484.58s)]
*  there's not enough continuity of information. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5486.58s)]
*  So what I mean by that is on stage [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5488.58s)]
*  not everyone can look at the same [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5490.58s)]
*  thing at the same time over and over and over and over. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5492.58s)]
*  Your memories are [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5494.58s)]
*  malleable. So honestly [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5496.58s)]
*  what I really do for a living is I create [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5498.58s)]
*  memories. And I don't mean that [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5500.58s)]
*  in a hoity-toity like New Age way. Like literally [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5502.58s)]
*  what I do is create memories. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5504.58s)]
*  The way you remember this and the way you're [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5506.58s)]
*  going to tell it has been engineered. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5508.58s)]
*  I've said certain things, I've done certain ways. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5510.58s)]
*  There's ways that I'm getting you [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5512.58s)]
*  to retell this moment. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5514.58s)]
*  And certain things get erased and certain [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5516.58s)]
*  things get highlighted. And there's a way you can do that. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5518.58s)]
*  So you said sometimes you take [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5520.58s)]
*  a long time to develop the trick. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5522.58s)]
*  Did you watch a lot of flagrant footage [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5526.58s)]
*  to get prepared for any of the tricks you did today? [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5528.58s)]
*  Yes. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5530.58s)]
*  So you're doing your research. Have you ever mentioned Jordan? [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5534.58s)]
*  Never. He never has. So look it up. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5536.58s)]
*  The internet will find that out. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5538.58s)]
*  How the fuck could you figure out Jordan? [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5540.58s)]
*  Was Jordan the girl with the gigantic tits you always talk about? [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5544.58s)]
*  Is it her only fans? [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5548.58s)]
*  No. No, not that one. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5550.58s)]
*  Oh, that girl! [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5552.58s)]
*  Because you keep talking about this girl with gigantic tits. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5554.58s)]
*  Huge tits. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5556.58s)]
*  And you always would bring it up. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5558.58s)]
*  And that would make sense because you talk about it so frequently. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5560.58s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5562.58s)]
*  Despite being married with a child. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5564.58s)]
*  I wasn't in college. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5566.58s)]
*  I can look in college. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5568.58s)]
*  I just had a girlfriend back in college. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5570.58s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5572.58s)]
*  She has no only fans? I think so. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5574.58s)]
*  Her dad missed one volleyball game. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5576.58s)]
*  One volleyball game. It's all it takes. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5578.58s)]
*  You said if I had done my research. Hell yeah, I've done my research. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5580.58s)]

*  I'm curious, do you find it unethical [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5758.58s)]
*  if a clairvoyant [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5760.58s)]
*  or tarot card reader tries to [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5762.58s)]
*  speak with the dead using similar tactics [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5764.58s)]
*  and basically creating false [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5766.58s)]
*  memories for someone and selling them [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5768.58s)]
*  the experience of having some type of [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5770.58s)]
*  supernatural phenomenon? [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5772.58s)]
*  Unethical is tough because [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5774.58s)]
*  it takes two to tango. So it's kind of [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5776.58s)]
*  like if that person's paying them and they [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5778.58s)]
*  want to believe in it, then I think there is a value [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5780.58s)]
*  proposition there. What are you getting [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5782.58s)]
*  out of that? Some people go to therapy for 10 years [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5784.58s)]
*  don't get anything out of it. Was that therapist ripping them [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5786.58s)]
*  off? I wouldn't do it. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5788.58s)]
*  Am I going to judge people that do that? [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5790.58s)]
*  No, but I'm also going to call BS [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5792.58s)]
*  when I see it. And so it's funny [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5794.58s)]
*  because on Rogan, he asked [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5796.58s)]
*  me about telepathy tapes. Yeah. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5798.58s)]
*  I've been getting some heat from people who are like, it's real, it's real. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5800.58s)]
*  I said very clearly, no, I said very clearly. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5802.58s)]
*  I go, I can't speak to whether it's [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5804.58s)]
*  real or not. Yeah. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5806.58s)]
*  Let me see who that is. You planted that. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5808.58s)]
*  I knew it. I knew that would happen right then. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5810.58s)]
*  I said specifically, I can't, it's like me saying if [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5812.58s)]
*  there's God. It's so ridiculous for me to tell you. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5814.58s)]
*  I said, but what I see in videos, [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5816.58s)]
*  I can explain through things that I [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5818.58s)]
*  understand that have to do with the five senses. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5820.58s)]
*  Do you understand? The same way that people will watch [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5822.58s)]
*  me, if you got a scientist in the room, [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5824.58s)]
*  I know how scientists think. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5826.58s)]
*  I could fool a scientist so easy. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5828.58s)]
*  Really? Scientists are actually easier to [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5830.58s)]
*  fool than dumb people in a lot of instances. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5832.58s)]
*  Because they have a certain [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5834.58s)]
*  way that there's a regimented thought pattern, right? [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5836.58s)]
*  If you have an algorithm [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5838.58s)]
*  and this is how it works, once you learn an [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5840.58s)]
*  algorithm, you can cheat the [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5842.58s)]
*  algorithm, right? Like I can tell you what certain [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5844.58s)]
*  videos are. And their thinking is more predictable. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5846.58s)]
*  Their thinking is so predictable. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5848.58s)]
*  This is the first thing. Oh, well, not this. A to B, [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5850.58s)]
*  A to B. In fact, that's why I'm saying it, not in a weird [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5852.58s)]
*  way. Certain people that are dumb or unpredictable [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5854.58s)]
*  are actually harder because [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5856.58s)]
*  see what I did? You look there. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5858.58s)]
*  You all looked. He looked later. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5860.58s)]
*  I know exactly what's, I, [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5862.58s)]
*  how misdirection works. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5864.58s)]
*  So, no, but he's still focused. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5866.58s)]
*  Why is that? Why did he look later? [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5868.58s)]
*  How I meet elders. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5870.58s)]
*  Fudd was more impressive than elders. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5872.58s)]
*  You just said pick a random word and you guessed it? [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5874.58s)]
*  But wait, but wait. So if you [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5876.58s)]
*  know how people think, [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5878.58s)]
*  the best poker players are unpredictable. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5880.58s)]
*  They don't, they do crazy stuff, they're weird [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5882.58s)]
*  moments and you can't pin them in. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5884.58s)]
*  So where I was going with this is with the [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5886.58s)]
*  telepathy tapes is I can't tell you [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5888.58s)]
*  if you are, if you're a parent and your child's [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5890.58s)]
*  doing this and you're like, that's an amazing [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5892.58s)]
*  feeling, that hope and joy. And I'm telling you right now, [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5894.58s)]
*  if it works for you, amazing. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5896.58s)]
*  Where it crosses the line is when you start selling [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5898.58s)]
*  to the public and paying and then you go into [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5900.58s)]
*  the public realm of I'm not debunking, [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5902.58s)]
*  but let me watch it and let me see what I think based [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5904.58s)]
*  on what I see. Could I do that [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5906.58s)]
*  with my methods? [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5908.58s)]
*  And the answer is yes. I could [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5910.58s)]
*  have it seem like I'm not communicating [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5912.58s)]
*  and I could show. So again, [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5914.58s)]
*  is it real? Are there psychics that are real? [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5916.58s)]
*  I'm sure there might be, but I've never, I [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5918.58s)]
*  haven't witnessed anything in person yet. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5920.58s)]
*  Not secondhand. People always tell you stories, [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5922.58s)]
*  it's different. Because psychics [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5924.58s)]
*  are very good at engineering memories the way I am. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5926.58s)]
*  They erase the misses, [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5928.58s)]
*  they highlight the hits. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5930.58s)]
*  So you forget all the things that went wrong, [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5932.58s)]
*  right? And there's like a recency [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5934.58s)]
*  bias and there's things that, there's just a lot [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5936.58s)]
*  of skills that are involved. The same [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5938.58s)]
*  way a callback hits, the same way comedians [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5940.58s)]
*  take the audience on a journey. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5942.58s)]
*  So I can, I [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5944.58s)]
*  know what things will be remembered, I know what he's going to [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5946.58s)]
*  talk about, I know what little things, like [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5948.58s)]
*  a lot of those are planted. It's very clever. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5950.58s)]
*  Like the way you would do a magic trick and you would [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5952.58s)]
*  you know, like move a hand here and actually do [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5954.58s)]
*  something here, this is just being done [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5956.58s)]
*  verbally. Right, it's verbal misdirection. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5958.58s)]
*  Yeah, it's really clever. Verbal misdirection, time misdirection, something called [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5960.58s)]
*  dual reality, where people experience [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5962.58s)]
*  things in a different way. What do you mean? [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5964.58s)]
*  That's, that's what it is, [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5966.58s)]
*  it's multiple realities. Like I create different [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5968.58s)]
*  memories for each person because they see in a different way. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5970.58s)]
*  So Alex is experiencing a different thing than I'm [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5972.58s)]
*  experiencing at the same time. He'll remember things differently in [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5974.58s)]
*  certain ways, for sure. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5976.58s)]
*  Have you ever done it with somebody [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5978.58s)]
*  who guessed in real time who was not a [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5980.58s)]
*  mentalist or didn't have any magic background? [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5982.58s)]
*  Oh, yeah, parties, I'll never forget [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5984.58s)]
*  there was this one dude who was a [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5986.58s)]
*  Russian rocket scientist who was [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5988.58s)]
*  sounds smart and he was. And he just [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5990.58s)]
*  like came up to me afterwards and he was very [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5992.58s)]
*  polite and he just explained everything I just did and I [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5994.58s)]
*  was like, yeah, that's right. Oh, wow. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5996.58s)]
*  What are you going to say? You would tell him? [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=5998.58s)]
*  I would in that case because it's a thing [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6000.58s)]
*  of respect and also I, he didn't come at [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6002.58s)]
*  me with this energy vibe of like I got you. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6004.58s)]
*  Right. It was more, it was very [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6006.58s)]
*  factual and I said to him, have you done [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6008.58s)]
*  mentalism before? And he's like, no. He just [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6010.58s)]
*  has an incredibly, he has [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6012.58s)]
*  just a mind that cannot be misdirected [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6014.58s)]
*  where he just locked in. He just locked [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6016.58s)]
*  in and he just think of Occam's razor [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6018.58s)]
*  and what's the simplest solution. And if it [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6020.58s)]
*  wasn't the simplest solution, what is a simpler solution? [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6022.58s)]
*  He was really good at, I don't [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6024.58s)]
*  know how to describe it. Like I do math [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6026.58s)]
*  with my kid with fractions. You keep one in the lowest [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6028.58s)]
*  common denominator. If you're smart, you can keep [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6030.58s)]
*  whittling away until you find the only method. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6032.58s)]
*  So with me, I can find when I watch [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6034.58s)]
*  other people do this, I know how they're doing it. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6036.58s)]
*  I know all the methods and I keep like looking [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6038.58s)]
*  to see which one it is. And when they mix [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6040.58s)]
*  methods, that's where it gets hard. Once [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6042.58s)]
*  you start doing like five different things [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6044.58s)]
*  and you jump from method to method [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6046.58s)]
*  to method, it's hard to track. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6048.58s)]
*  Who fools you? Who is a person or an [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6050.58s)]
*  effect that you saw that you were like, oh [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6052.58s)]
*  just. Yeah, who saw? I saw Darren Brown [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6054.58s)]
*  in the UK who's great. I saw his show [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6056.58s)]
*  Fool Me. I don't want to say Fool Me because again [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6058.58s)]
*  I don't want to, like I know how it's all done [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6060.58s)]
*  because we're in the same business, but I loved it. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6062.58s)]
*  He had a fantastic [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6064.58s)]
*  thing happen during his show that I still can't [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6066.58s)]
*  explain. At one point [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6068.58s)]
*  in time, [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6070.58s)]
*  like he tells you to look at this person [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6072.58s)]
*  on stage and we're like supposed [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6074.58s)]
*  to look at them and they're just staying there and I could [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6076.58s)]
*  be like butchering this. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6078.58s)]
*  At one point the person like [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6080.58s)]
*  just turns into someone in [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6082.58s)]
*  a monkey costume. Right. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6084.58s)]
*  And then they're [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6086.58s)]
*  just there and he goes, and you guys didn't even notice [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6088.58s)]
*  that they're in a monkey costume. And then the whole [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6090.58s)]
*  audience looks over. They've been on the stage [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6092.58s)]
*  the whole time. Right. Like how do you garner [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6094.58s)]
*  the entire audience's attention [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6096.58s)]
*  and direct it at one part of the [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6098.58s)]
*  stage and get us to completely ignore [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6100.58s)]
*  the other part of the stage. Right. It was [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6102.58s)]
*  brilliant. It's amazing. Because I [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6104.58s)]
*  before that was going, I'm not leaving [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6106.58s)]
*  that guy. Right. Like I'm going, I'm not getting [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6108.58s)]
*  tricked. I'm just staring at that one person on the stage [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6110.58s)]
*  because something's happened. And then they turn into a monkey. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6112.58s)]
*  Yep. It is [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6114.58s)]
*  a little disappointing how easily [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6116.58s)]
*  led you are whenever you get fooled by this. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6118.58s)]
*  That's the thing that I'm like, oh man I went to the [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6120.58s)]
*  exact fucking dollar bill he knew I was going to go to. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6122.58s)]
*  How did I do that? That's part of it [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6124.58s)]
*  but also the fact that that's how scammers [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6126.58s)]
*  work. So like I my best if I were to switch careers [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6128.58s)]
*  I could be a scammer tomorrow. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6130.58s)]
*  I could do psychic stuff but you [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6132.58s)]
*  what do you do when you get. I got a few guys I can introduce you to. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6134.58s)]
*  I'm an honest con man. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6136.58s)]
*  Alex is like let's talk offline. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6138.58s)]
*  I mean the change breaking [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6140.58s)]
*  scam is like an all time great. Sure. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6142.58s)]
*  Like I'm sure you're familiar with this. Of course. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6144.58s)]
*  I don't know if explaining it is, I mean it's a scam [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6146.58s)]
*  so I don't know. Yeah. I don't think it's a scam. I mean [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6148.58s)]
*  you might be able to do a better job. You're talking about when you [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6150.58s)]
*  exchange the money and you count it different ways. Exactly. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6152.58s)]
*  So basically like going to a cashier [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6154.58s)]
*  saying like hey I have a 50 could you break it and then they break [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6156.58s)]
*  it and then basically through [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6158.58s)]
*  kind of sleight of hand but also sleight of [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6160.58s)]
*  you know tongue you're basically able to [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6162.58s)]
*  get you know 70 dollars from them. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6164.58s)]
*  So you give them 50 and they give you 70 [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6166.58s)]
*  and multiple 20s. You take a 20 say hey [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6168.58s)]
*  actually could I get 10s instead. They take it back. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6170.58s)]
*  And you keep on switching. You [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6172.58s)]
*  confuse them. Yeah. It's a [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6174.58s)]
*  method of confusion and they don't really know. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6176.58s)]
*  And it's at that moment again we create memories right when they're [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6178.58s)]
*  supposed to do something you shift [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6180.58s)]
*  their mind and your mind can only focus on one thing [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6182.58s)]
*  in a certain way at the same time. And all this money is out [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6184.58s)]
*  and they're not sure which is yours and which is theirs. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6186.58s)]
*  Exactly. Do you have [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6188.58s)]
*  a background in hypnosis at all or do you [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6190.58s)]
*  just sort of understand? I don't do hypnosis in my show [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6192.58s)]
*  but I've done hypnosis. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6194.58s)]
*  Oh really? How hard was that to learn? [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6196.58s)]
*  Very easy. Really? What I used to do [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6198.58s)]
*  I had this weird thing when high school in high school I did a project. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6200.58s)]
*  Can you try it too? Are any of us compliant [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6202.58s)]
*  enough to do it? I'm not good enough [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6204.58s)]
*  at hypnosis because I don't. I've tried it. I've done mostly [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6206.58s)]
*  auto hypnosis. This sounds like I'm. You hypnotize yourself. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6208.58s)]
*  To get into a meditative state or something like that? [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6210.58s)]
*  It was more of I used to lucid dream. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6212.58s)]
*  It's like an erotic thing. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6214.58s)]
*  You put a belt around your neck [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6216.58s)]
*  and it's nothing weird. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6218.58s)]
*  I'm hypnotizing myself. Don't come in. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6220.58s)]
*  No I tried that I think for sleep [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6222.58s)]
*  or something for insomnia. It's not [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6224.58s)]
*  that I'm too smart or I'm just so in my head [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6226.58s)]
*  and like confused if I'm doing everything correctly [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6228.58s)]
*  that I couldn't even work. It was called progressive muscle [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6230.58s)]
*  relaxation. So I did this in senior year [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6232.58s)]
*  I did a project on lucid dreaming. Do you know what that is? [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6234.58s)]
*  Yeah of course. And I learned how to lucid [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6236.58s)]
*  dream multiple times a night and it was the coolest [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6238.58s)]
*  thing ever. It's very interesting. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6240.58s)]
*  There have been shows on it since but it's like that movie [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6242.58s)]
*  Inception almost. You know where you would spin [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6244.58s)]
*  the thing? It's spinning. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6246.58s)]
*  So what I learned to do is once [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6248.58s)]
*  as you go to bed you just literally squeeze [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6250.58s)]
*  every muscle for 10 seconds and [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6252.58s)]
*  then let go and keep relaxing your body. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6254.58s)]
*  It wasn't that hard and you would tell yourself [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6256.58s)]
*  getting more tired. More tired [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6258.58s)]
*  when I count back and you count your head and you do this for [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6260.58s)]
*  like three or four minutes. And then [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6262.58s)]
*  the last thought before you [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6264.58s)]
*  go to bed is the one that slips in your subconscious [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6266.58s)]
*  and the way you can feel, it's called the hypnagogic stage [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6268.58s)]
*  is if you put your arm up while you're sleeping [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6270.58s)]
*  like this, it's when you jolt. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6272.58s)]
*  You ever do that next to your wife? You jolt and she feels [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6274.58s)]
*  that you were sleeping or you're watching a show. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6276.58s)]
*  If you can control that jolt because your arm will fall [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6278.58s)]
*  and you'll feel it. Right then [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6280.58s)]
*  if you can tell yourself something as you're going to bed [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6282.58s)]
*  it slips from your conscious to your subconscious [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6284.58s)]
*  very effectively in those last few seconds [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6286.58s)]
*  because you're in that state with your brain. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6288.58s)]
*  And so what I would do, this is a weird [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6290.58s)]
*  thing I didn't see in years, I would check my watch [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6292.58s)]
*  OCD style all day [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6294.58s)]
*  every two or three minutes during the day at school. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6296.58s)]
*  Every two or three minutes I would look at my watch [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6298.58s)]
*  and after about a week and a half of doing it [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6300.58s)]
*  in my dream I started doing it. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6302.58s)]
*  And so in your dream if you look at your watch [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6304.58s)]
*  you look away and you look back. There's all different ways [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6306.58s)]
*  it's always a different time. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6308.58s)]
*  So in your dream I would now go [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6310.58s)]
*  I'm dreaming and I try not [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6312.58s)]
*  to wake up because usually if you feel it you wake up [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6314.58s)]
*  but if you got good at it and I used to do that five, six times a night [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6316.58s)]
*  and do crazy stuff. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6318.58s)]
*  And it got erotic. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6320.58s)]
*  I've had some lucid dreams before [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6322.58s)]
*  that what I thought was interesting is that [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6324.58s)]
*  I don't have complete autonomy [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6326.58s)]
*  in some of them. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6328.58s)]
*  So I've had the one where I'm dreaming [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6330.58s)]
*  and what I would do is I would just pinch myself [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6332.58s)]
*  because that's what I always heard. I was like, oh if you pinch yourself [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6334.58s)]
*  you'll wake up. And I would pinch myself and I'm waking up [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6336.58s)]
*  and I'm like, oh shit am I actually dreaming right now? [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6338.58s)]
*  I am dreaming. And I remembered distinctly [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6340.58s)]
*  one I was like, I think I can fly. And I flew. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6342.58s)]
*  I think I can make things grow. And I made [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6344.58s)]
*  them grow. And it was pretty awesome. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6346.58s)]
*  And then I've had ones where I was like, I'm dreaming right now [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6348.58s)]
*  but I was too scared [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6350.58s)]
*  to jump off of something and use the powers. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6352.58s)]
*  So, which is just like [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6354.58s)]
*  being alive, which is kind of boring. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6356.58s)]
*  Right. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6358.58s)]
*  Did you check this 401k right then? [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6360.58s)]
*  I'm limited, yet I'm still in my dream. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6362.58s)]
*  So have you had both versions [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6364.58s)]
*  of those lucid dreams? [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6366.58s)]
*  I haven't done it because I have a lot of kids now [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6368.58s)]
*  and so like sleep is at a premium and I don't sleep enough. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6370.58s)]
*  But I wanted to. I remember during COVID I did it for about a week or two. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6372.58s)]
*  I got that muscle memory back. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6374.58s)]
*  And I thought it was fun. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6376.58s)]
*  Every time you could do what you wanted or you were limited in some? [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6378.58s)]
*  You wake up. So the problem is if you get [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6380.58s)]
*  because your brain tries to convince you. I can't tell if it's a weird [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6382.58s)]
*  boring conversation. But your brain [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6384.58s)]
*  tries to snap you out of it. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6386.58s)]
*  Because it's the same way if you ever hear an alarm [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6388.58s)]
*  it gets worked into your dream [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6390.58s)]
*  as some sort of thing like, oh why is this guy [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6392.58s)]
*  honking the horn over and over and over again? [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6394.58s)]
*  And then you wake up and you realize it was that. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6396.58s)]
*  You ever get out of a dream where you want to get back [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6398.58s)]
*  in? It was so good. You're like, I need back right now. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6400.58s)]
*  Sometimes you can get back in though. You can get back in. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6402.58s)]
*  That's the thing with lucid ones where you get back in and you're like, oh my god I'm back in it. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6404.58s)]
*  And that's when you [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6406.58s)]
*  that's when you realize, are we in a simulation? [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6408.58s)]
*  Because now if a dream [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6410.58s)]
*  feels that real and you can control it in your own mind [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6412.58s)]
*  you know. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6414.58s)]
*  What is this? You guys took the mushrooms too right? [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6416.58s)]
*  We all took the mushrooms. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6418.58s)]
*  The hypnosis thing I find [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6420.58s)]
*  really interesting. I read this book [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6422.58s)]
*  Reality is Plastic. I don't know if you're familiar with it. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6424.58s)]
*  I think I've seen it. I haven't read it. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6426.58s)]
*  Well there's a few that actually I want to ask you about. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6428.58s)]
*  Also the Full Facts of Cold Reading by Ian Roland. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6430.58s)]
*  That's a great book. I know Ian. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6432.58s)]
*  I mean it's so cool. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6434.58s)]
*  Can I pee real quick before we get into this? [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6436.58s)]
*  And we're back. Okay. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6438.58s)]
*  You were talking about. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6440.58s)]
*  I cleaned up the money. I cleaned up the money. Thank you. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6442.58s)]
*  Akash was trying to steal it all. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6444.58s)]
*  So yeah, those two books I find [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6446.58s)]
*  really interesting. Reality is Plastic [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6448.58s)]
*  I found fascinating because it kind of puts [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6450.58s)]
*  hypnosis on a spectrum. Right? [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6452.58s)]
*  With stage hypnosis specifically you have [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6454.58s)]
*  some people that are sort of like going along with the action. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6456.58s)]
*  You know they're hearing hypnosis and they're kind of like doing improv. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6458.58s)]
*  And then there's sort of like a middle ground [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6460.58s)]
*  where you're sort of in like a dream and [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6462.58s)]
*  things make sense when you're on stage and you [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6464.58s)]
*  know where you are and you're in this sort of consensus [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6466.58s)]
*  reality. But you have this feeling where you're like [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6468.58s)]
*  yeah, no, I am afraid of this water bottle. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6470.58s)]
*  And then there's another version of like full on [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6472.58s)]
*  hypnotherapy where you're not really [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6474.58s)]
*  in your conscious mind in any capacity. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6476.58s)]
*  Yeah, fully. And those people come out [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6478.58s)]
*  of it and they say I have no idea what happened. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6480.58s)]
*  They also have physical sensations [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6482.58s)]
*  created by their mind. Which is like the Matrix [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6484.58s)]
*  type stuff. Where they've shown [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6486.58s)]
*  people where they're completely hypnotized and you'll [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6488.58s)]
*  touch them with an ice cube and they'll get a burn [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6490.58s)]
*  mark. They'll have a physical burn which seems impossible [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6492.58s)]
*  because their mind creates. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6494.58s)]
*  It's like, you know, it's like in the Matrix [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6496.58s)]
*  and you go well what if I happen to die in the Matrix? [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6498.58s)]
*  The body cannot live without the mind. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6500.58s)]
*  And they'll get a burn because they think that they're being [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6502.58s)]
*  burned with a hot poker with an ice cube. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6504.58s)]
*  And will physically show up or will be the sensation? [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6506.58s)]
*  I've seen that. I mean I haven't seen it in person. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6508.58s)]
*  I've seen some of the funniest things, some of the funniest shows I've ever [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6510.58s)]
*  seen in my life, even blow away stand up comedy [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6512.58s)]
*  are really good hypnotists. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6514.58s)]
*  I think I was 17 [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6516.58s)]
*  and I went to Windsor. I lived outside of Metro Detroit. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6518.58s)]
*  And this is a hypnotist that I knew. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6520.58s)]
*  It was like an X-rated show they let me in. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6522.58s)]
*  And he had a guy on stage. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6524.58s)]
*  I'll never forget this as long as I live. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6526.58s)]
*  I was in the front row. The guy on stage [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6528.58s)]
*  is wearing like khakis and he's very [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6530.58s)]
*  buttoned up. You know like a corporate guy. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6532.58s)]
*  And you did not expect this from him. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6534.58s)]
*  He had balloons next to him and he kept saying you're [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6536.58s)]
*  pregnant. And he kept giving him [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6538.58s)]
*  different balloons to put in it. And he'd go oh [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6540.58s)]
*  touch my baby. And he pretended to be like a pregnant woman. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6542.58s)]
*  And then it kept going, kept going until he had [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6544.58s)]
*  this. And then he gave him bigger balloons. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6546.58s)]
*  And you know they have people in line and they do different [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6548.58s)]
*  stuff bits with everybody. And they keep coming back [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6550.58s)]
*  to each guy. Do you know what I'm saying? [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6552.58s)]
*  Yeah of course. And so they come back to this one guy and he's [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6554.58s)]
*  finally the baby's coming. Are you ready? [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6556.58s)]
*  And they put his legs up. And this guy [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6558.58s)]
*  I'm in the front row and this is my buddy doing it. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6560.58s)]
*  He goes push push. And I heard [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6562.58s)]
*  this shit his face. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6564.58s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6570.58s)]
*  That's good. I'll never forget [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6572.58s)]
*  as long as I live. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6574.58s)]
*  And I see my buddy's face. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6576.58s)]
*  And we both and I'm not [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6578.58s)]
*  close enough to smell it. But I can definitely [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6580.58s)]
*  see there's like the pants [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6582.58s)]
*  look full you know. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6584.58s)]
*  Free cell phone man. I'm like I'm like 42. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6590.58s)]
*  And so this is I didn't even have a cell phone then. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6592.58s)]
*  I asked him after the show [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6594.58s)]
*  like a day or two later. He's like yo man that guy stayed [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6596.58s)]
*  after. And he was like he was really mad. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6598.58s)]
*  And he goes why? He didn't remember anything. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6600.58s)]
*  He was like why did you show my face? [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6602.58s)]
*  One of the single top five [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6606.58s)]
*  funniest things I've ever seen in person in my entire [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6608.58s)]
*  life. I'll just never. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6610.58s)]
*  Yeah the hypnotism shows are incredible. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6612.58s)]
*  There's just the noise like a wet [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6614.58s)]
*  like a grown man pushing [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6616.58s)]
*  us down. Why do you think that's not [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6618.58s)]
*  a bigger art form? [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6620.58s)]
*  I don't know why. I don't know why because the people that [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6622.58s)]
*  do it really really well [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6624.58s)]
*  kill it. I have a buddy Chris Jones [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6626.58s)]
*  shout out to my buddy in Chicago [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6628.58s)]
*  who's incredible. Fellow runner we are [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6630.58s)]
*  America's Got Talent Together. He did a thing where [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6632.58s)]
*  he shook Howie Mandel's hand. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6634.58s)]
*  Howie Mandel's notorious germaphobe. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6636.58s)]
*  And he hypnotized him thinking he had gloves on. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6638.58s)]
*  He started shaking everybody's hands. Never done it before. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6640.58s)]
*  He kind of looks like Drake. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6642.58s)]
*  He's gonna love this plug but he's awesome. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6644.58s)]
*  There's so many hypnotists I've seen. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6646.58s)]
*  He hypnotized Howie so he could shake his hand. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6648.58s)]
*  That was his hand to fan. He blew up. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6650.58s)]
*  It went so viral. How crazy is that? [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6652.58s)]
*  Howie won't shake anyone's hand. He'll fist bump. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6654.58s)]
*  And it's like ingrained. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6656.58s)]
*  It's a phobia. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6658.58s)]
*  Why does he think that the germs can't get on the outside? [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6660.58s)]
*  I don't have an answer to that question. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6662.58s)]
*  That's like I'll never forget [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6664.58s)]
*  when during COVID we had to stand. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6666.58s)]
*  You used to be a part but at the bank line [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6668.58s)]
*  we'd be two feet apart. And I'm like thank god the disease [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6670.58s)]
*  can't. Thank god it can't go horizontal. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6672.58s)]
*  I don't know the logic. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6674.58s)]
*  I guess because you don't touch stuff with the back of your hand. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6676.58s)]
*  Do you know the function of the disruption [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6678.58s)]
*  of a pattern? So like with a lot of [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6680.58s)]
*  hypnotism it'll be like a handshake [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6682.58s)]
*  and then a snap and now you're asleep. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6684.58s)]
*  And what is that? [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6686.58s)]
*  If you just put him asleep right now that would be [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6688.58s)]
*  a good thing. Oh my god. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6690.58s)]
*  Tell us all the tricks. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6692.58s)]
*  Open my eyes. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6694.58s)]
*  Wait, you're saying go. But do you know what is [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6696.58s)]
*  happening there on a hypnotic level? [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6698.58s)]
*  I wish I'm not nearly [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6700.58s)]
*  attuned enough to [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6702.58s)]
*  have noticed my field of specialty. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6704.58s)]
*  He's just so excited to have anyone on. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6706.58s)]
*  I have friends that know this that could go into [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6708.58s)]
*  major depth on this subject because they know [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6710.58s)]
*  what it does and what it does. Some of it actually [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6712.58s)]
*  affects your brain. There's actually a jarring [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6714.58s)]
*  level of you move and [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6716.58s)]
*  there's a force to it. The quick induction techniques [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6718.58s)]
*  like that. But I think [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6720.58s)]
*  some of it's fake. Really? [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6722.58s)]
*  Some of the videos on the gram, yes. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6724.58s)]
*  Yeah, who doesn't? You have an incentive [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6726.58s)]
*  structure that's aligned where let's go viral [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6728.58s)]
*  together. Some of it's real but [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6730.58s)]
*  I've seen some where you almost want them to open their [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6732.58s)]
*  eyes and go like give a little wink. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6734.58s)]
*  But most of it's real. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6736.58s)]
*  When the incentive structure is not aligned [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6738.58s)]
*  right? When somebody's on stage [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6740.58s)]
*  chitting their pants. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6742.58s)]
*  Typically not. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6744.58s)]
*  Have you ever gotten a negative [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6746.58s)]
*  reaction specifically on a [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6748.58s)]
*  cultural level? [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6750.58s)]
*  I've had things go wrong on cultural levels. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6752.58s)]
*  I've had things where [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6754.58s)]
*  I've never [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6756.58s)]
*  done a trick for a Caribbean person [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6758.58s)]
*  like a West African person that has voodoo in the culture [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6760.58s)]
*  and they're angry. I've not done that but I used to do a lot [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6762.58s)]
*  of stuff for the mafia. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6764.58s)]
*  I did a lot of mafia owned restaurants [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6766.58s)]
*  when I moved to New York City. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6768.58s)]
*  When I moved to New York City I still [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6770.58s)]
*  worked at restaurants. I worked on Wall Street for about [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6772.58s)]
*  two and a half years and then I was doing this [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6774.58s)]
*  as a side hustle. So I worked restaurants [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6776.58s)]
*  to give out business cards and to get parties. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6778.58s)]
*  And a lot of the top Italian [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6780.58s)]
*  joints are mafia owned [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6782.58s)]
*  and mafia run. So I would do parties when the guys [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6784.58s)]
*  would get out. It was straight sopranos. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6786.58s)]
*  Guys get out and they have a party [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6788.58s)]
*  there that believe all this shit. Some of them [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6790.58s)]
*  do but some of them don't like the challenge. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6792.58s)]
*  So right there there's a [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6794.58s)]
*  dick measuring competition where [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6796.58s)]
*  you know something I don't know right now. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6798.58s)]
*  And you make me look stupid. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6800.58s)]
*  Exactly. As if I'm challenging. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6802.58s)]
*  As if I just made you look stupid [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6804.58s)]
*  and I need to show my authority [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6806.58s)]
*  over you. I've never had [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6808.58s)]
*  altercations. I had a buddy who actually had a switch [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6810.58s)]
*  blade pulled out and he had his ponytail and it was brought [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6812.58s)]
*  back and they said if you don't tell me how you did that I'm going to [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6814.58s)]
*  cut off your ponytail. Which is a crazy [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6816.58s)]
*  story. Mine I'm always able to get out of it [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6818.58s)]
*  because of humor. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6820.58s)]
*  I can rib, I can roast, I can self deprecate [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6822.58s)]
*  and find a way out of it and misdirect. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6824.58s)]
*  If you try to take it head on [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6828.58s)]
*  you're going to lose that battle. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6830.58s)]
*  If you can make people move in a pattern [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6832.58s)]
*  and see what is at the core that they want [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6834.58s)]
*  they want to not be made to look bad. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6836.58s)]
*  They want to feel like they're part of it. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6838.58s)]
*  You know what you know how to do this stuff let me show you something right now. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6840.58s)]

*  I know that you get it. You totally know how [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6844.58s)]

*  You show them something stupid and then [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6850.58s)]
*  they feel like they're good. And they're like that was amazing [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6852.58s)]

*  to pursue my dream and open my own business [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6886.58s)]
*  in the entertainment industry. Which sounded [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6888.58s)]
*  either like you're a porn star or I don't know what. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6890.58s)]
*  It was really flowery and sounded [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6892.58s)]
*  great. And then when she met me she was like so what do you do? [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6894.58s)]

*  I'm starting from like negative 20. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6902.58s)]
*  That's the thing like how does a girl [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6904.58s)]
*  grapple with that? Like did you have to convince her that this [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6906.58s)]
*  was going to work out? Were you successful at that time? [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6908.58s)]
*  Like what? I wasn't not successful [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6910.58s)]
*  but I was not. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6912.58s)]
*  Another amazing part about this. It's hard to see the upside. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6914.58s)]
*  I got adult braces which is really [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6916.58s)]
*  a panty dropper by itself. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6918.58s)]
*  I got them off three days before I met her. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6920.58s)]
*  I've literally [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6922.58s)]
*  looked at my children and you remember like in Back to [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6924.58s)]
*  the Future where you see the photo disappear [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6926.58s)]
*  like the photo I'm like all of you [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6928.58s)]
*  if I had just had them on for five more days none of you [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6930.58s)]
*  would have seen yourself. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6932.58s)]
*  She's told me straight up [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6934.58s)]
*  if you had braces on our first date [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6936.58s)]
*  ex-nay. Was there ever a part where she was [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6938.58s)]
*  like I'm not going to date a struggling magician [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6940.58s)]
*  and start a family with them? She's like a venture capital [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6942.58s)]
*  firm. She somehow saw this. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6944.58s)]
*  She...I put this in the book [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6946.58s)]
*  like I tried to dump her which was the stupidest [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6948.58s)]
*  mistake I ever made in my life. Wait why? [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6950.58s)]
*  I'm just immature. I wasn't like [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6952.58s)]
*  I'd been in a relationship from college sweetheart and then [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6954.58s)]
*  I'm going to another relationship and I'm like you know I'm in my [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6956.58s)]
*  20. I can't get locked down like this [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6958.58s)]
*  while I had a winning lottery ticket. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6960.58s)]
*  I just didn't know it. And she pretty much [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6962.58s)]
*  she's smart. She's way smarter than me. Mature. She's like [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6964.58s)]
*  no. And she deconstructed like a mentalist [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6966.58s)]
*  while I was breaking up with her. I'm like that's not right. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6968.58s)]
*  You just wanted to get some pussy. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6970.58s)]
*  Now that you... [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6972.58s)]
*  You got some excess. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6974.58s)]
*  You wanted to win a cape man. Superman got a fly. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6976.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6978.58s)]
*  So [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6980.58s)]
*  I was being stupid and then [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6982.58s)]
*  it flipped. The whole dynamic flipped. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6984.58s)]
*  When I was like when she [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6986.58s)]
*  we didn't break up and I was like can you do that? Can you say no [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6988.58s)]
*  to a breakup? And then I wanted her more [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6990.58s)]
*  and I'm like can you move in with me? She's like yeah let's slow it down. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6992.58s)]
*  I'm like whoa she's about to dump me. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6994.58s)]
*  She's outplaying me. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6996.58s)]
*  You only have two minutes. Yeah. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=6998.58s)]
*  Two minutes your own game. Yeah no tipping. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7000.58s)]
*  The owner brought me in. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7002.58s)]
*  She probably realized that you [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7004.58s)]
*  need the chase. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7006.58s)]
*  She did. It was very good. She's [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7008.58s)]
*  the brains of the operation. I did a trick. I always had like [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7010.58s)]
*  I had my tricks. So I have certain tricks [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7012.58s)]
*  that I did when I was like a teenager that were designed for [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7014.58s)]
*  certain situations. Like I had [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7016.58s)]
*  the stoner trick. I had certain tricks I [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7018.58s)]
*  did when people were stoned or high. Like what? What do you mean? [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7020.58s)]
*  Visuals. They're like things that mess you [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7022.58s)]
*  up visually. Okay. I was in... [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7024.58s)]
*  This is a great story. So before weed was legal [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7026.58s)]
*  in Amsterdam [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7028.58s)]
*  are you from that era where you'd have to go to [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7030.58s)]
*  Amsterdam and smoke weed? If you wanted [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7032.58s)]
*  to legally. It was like a fun thing that you could actually smoke in a [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7034.58s)]
*  cafe. It was like a thing. Yeah. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7036.58s)]
*  This is 20 years ago. So I [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7038.58s)]
*  stopped there on the way to a flight and I go into [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7040.58s)]
*  a bulldog cafe. I'll never forget this [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7042.58s)]
*  place. And... We have [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7044.58s)]
*  been. Yeah. You know that place. And you can do [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7046.58s)]
*  mushrooms there. And so there's a table [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7048.58s)]
*  with all Americans. I find them. And [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7050.58s)]
*  one dude's on mushrooms who you can tell. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7052.58s)]
*  Like you can tell. And then everyone else [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7054.58s)]
*  Americans. And we smoked weed. I'm not a [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7056.58s)]
*  big weed guy. Like I don't really like it anymore. But at the time [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7058.58s)]
*  big pothead. And so [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7060.58s)]
*  that's a different level of high. He's [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7062.58s)]
*  fully tripping balls. And I bring [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7064.58s)]
*  out. I do card tricks for them. But I bring [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7066.58s)]
*  out like the one that I'm going to do [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7068.58s)]
*  for this guy. And this is a very specific [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7070.58s)]
*  trick. I can't do it for you now. I apologize. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7072.58s)]
*  Where I say to somebody take any card out [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7074.58s)]
*  of a deck of cards. And he takes it. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7076.58s)]
*  I would have been prepared. I could have done this [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7078.58s)]
*  for you. I just don't do it anymore. I don't do it with much like slight a hand. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7080.58s)]
*  He holds it here. And let's say it's the four [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7082.58s)]
*  of hearts. I take the rest of the [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7084.58s)]
*  cards. And the only way I can describe this. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7086.58s)]
*  Because again I don't mean to tease you. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7088.58s)]
*  Is he's holding it tight with two hands. I go whatever you do. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7090.58s)]
*  Don't blink. And don't let me touch [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7092.58s)]
*  it. And I move the cards around. And I go [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7094.58s)]
*  don't blink. And I go like this. And I go back. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7096.58s)]
*  And the card is now one [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7098.58s)]
*  eighth the size. It is shrunken. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7100.58s)]
*  It is shrunken. I would [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7102.58s)]
*  fuck him up. And so I'll never forget [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7104.58s)]
*  this guy's face. It's like it's so [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7106.58s)]
*  imprinted on my memory. He looked at the card. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7108.58s)]
*  And he kept blinking. Right? [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7110.58s)]
*  Because you understand. And then he [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7112.58s)]
*  looked around at us. Then he looked [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7114.58s)]
*  at the card. Then he put it down. And then he [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7116.58s)]
*  left. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7118.58s)]
*  And I had to go because I was on a layover. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7122.58s)]
*  So I only hung out with these people for like two hours. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7124.58s)]
*  But he still wasn't back. And I felt [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7126.58s)]
*  really bad. But I also [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7128.58s)]
*  was like that was pretty much the most epic reaction [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7130.58s)]
*  of all time. So I'm like I [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7132.58s)]
*  don't think he's dead. I like to assume [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7134.58s)]
*  he just I don't know what he did. But that [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7136.58s)]
*  Do you remember what you said to that group of strangers to get them to allow you to do magic for them? [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7138.58s)]
*  Oh dude we were just Americans. Like in that situation [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7142.58s)]

*  It's like yo you have tricks? Yeah. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7146.58s)]
*  They probably asked. What did you say? [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7148.58s)]
*  Hey do you guys want to see a trick? I was like [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7150.58s)]
*  oh you guys are American? Like I heard them talking. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7152.58s)]

*  you don't want to smoke by yourself. It was awkward. So I [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7156.58s)]
*  That's a yes or no question. Which one? Can I hang with [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7158.58s)]

*  but I can't. The card trick is not going to compare [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7180.58s)]
*  to Fanta, LGR, [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7182.58s)]
*  and Flamethrower. Yeah that's great. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7184.58s)]

*  some prep. Can you tell us things about [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7192.58s)]
*  us that help you perform tricks on us? [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7194.58s)]
*  Like maybe something you notice he does, [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7196.58s)]
*  something you notice I do. Can you [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7198.58s)]
*  divulge that or you like to keep those in touch? [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7200.58s)]
*  I can't quantify it out loud. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7202.58s)]
*  A lot of it's on a feel basis. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7204.58s)]
*  A lot of it is if I can get to a place early [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7206.58s)]
*  and meet people and see what I'm going to do. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7208.58s)]
*  But I can come in here and do this podcast fresh. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7210.58s)]
*  We could have walked in the door and I literally come from [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7212.58s)]
*  being outside pouring rain even though I had to dry off [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7214.58s)]
*  when I got here. We were both soaked. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7216.58s)]
*  And so having ten minutes to decompress, [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7218.58s)]
*  say hello, shake hands, kind of feel people out [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7220.58s)]
*  is helpful. But when I go on stage [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7222.58s)]
*  for hundreds and thousands of people, [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7224.58s)]
*  I can't meet anybody. It's not possible. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7226.58s)]
*  So at that point, you're doing a lot of the cold reading [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7228.58s)]
*  in the moment. Got it. And so a lot of the [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7230.58s)]
*  secret sauce when I walk out in the crowd [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7232.58s)]
*  is it's kind of like crowd work. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7234.58s)]
*  Crowd work is you see someone, you're going to see [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7236.58s)]
*  what's funny about them and see what you can get from them. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7238.58s)]
*  Mine is a version of crowd work. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7240.58s)]
*  My crowd work is going to be like, it's a puzzle. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7242.58s)]
*  It's a puzzle. How do I turn it this way, this way, this way [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7244.58s)]
*  and then unlock what they're going to think? [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7246.58s)]
*  And I like going to the person who's going to [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7248.58s)]
*  sometimes give me the over the top crazy reaction. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7250.58s)]
*  I sometimes like the quiet, [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7252.58s)]
*  oh my god, slowly, [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7254.58s)]
*  and then explode and freak out. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7256.58s)]
*  There's going to be all different kinds of laughs, [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7258.58s)]
*  all different kinds of amazement, and I can [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7260.58s)]
*  calibrate pretty well. What kills me [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7262.58s)]
*  is when I get something wrong in a show and I don't know why [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7264.58s)]
*  I got it wrong. So you said get it wrong. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7266.58s)]
*  Sometimes I get something wrong, but I figured out [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7268.58s)]
*  what happened so I can kind of get out of it. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7270.58s)]
*  But I've gotten stuff wrong where I don't know what happened. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7272.58s)]
*  Give me a example. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7274.58s)]
*  I did a show for, I'm not going to say the client [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7276.58s)]
*  because they're probably going to hire me again, [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7278.58s)]
*  but a very large payroll provider, the biggest one. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7280.58s)]
*  And I opened for Alicia Keys. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7282.58s)]
*  And it was awesome, great show. She does a great show. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7284.58s)]
*  In like Hollywood, I think it was [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7286.58s)]
*  the Hollywood Bowl or somewhere. I don't know, several thousand [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7288.58s)]
*  people. And I know what this [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7290.58s)]
*  guy was thinking. Do you understand? I can tell you for a [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7292.58s)]
*  fact. I understand everything about it. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7294.58s)]
*  I knew what he picked. I knew what he was thinking of [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7296.58s)]
*  in this moment. I would have bet my life [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7298.58s)]
*  on it. And yet he insisted [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7300.58s)]
*  100% that that's not it. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7302.58s)]
*  And so what are you going to do? [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7304.58s)]
*  Right? Because the show is at the end of the day [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7306.58s)]
*  is, I mean, if you had the [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7308.58s)]
*  piece of paper that showed you that he wrote down [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7310.58s)]
*  the word fart so we could have pieced it together. But what [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7312.58s)]
*  if he didn't? What if I didn't? And the other word is [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7314.58s)]
*  in the book. How could we even know that? What if he just said no, that's [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7316.58s)]
*  not the word. It's not the word. It's not tourists. It's not this. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7318.58s)]
*  What could I do? Right? But I [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7320.58s)]
*  can normally tell who's going to lie, [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7322.58s)]
*  who's going to be a stick in the mud, who's opposite. I [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7324.58s)]
*  completely misjudged this guy. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7326.58s)]
*  It's like if you were dating somebody and you found out [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7328.58s)]
*  they were serial killers, you're like, I can't believe I [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7330.58s)]
*  missed all that. I couldn't understand how it went [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7332.58s)]
*  wrong. And then I'm like flop sweating, trying to reconstruct it. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7334.58s)]
*  And then sometimes I dig in. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7337.58s)]
*  That's the worst. If you dig in, it's like [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7339.58s)]
*  crowd work to somebody who's not responding [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7341.58s)]
*  and keep trying to get it. And then you should just [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7343.58s)]
*  let go. Yeah. At that point, sometimes [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7345.58s)]
*  fuck them. Oh, sometimes [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7347.58s)]
*  fuck them. But then it's fuck you, though, because now you're digging in the audience. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7349.58s)]
*  The audience [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7351.58s)]
*  talks against you. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7353.58s)]
*  Yeah, I can't like light the ship on fire. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7355.58s)]
*  This isn't like a Mark Maron. Like I'm just going to F. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7357.58s)]
*  You know, I've seen him go in the audience and just like [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7359.58s)]
*  let it go. I love that. There's some element [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7361.58s)]
*  of that that you enjoy. But for me, [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7363.58s)]
*  I have to be kind of likeable. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7365.58s)]
*  Or it makes it so I can't do the rest of the stuff. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7367.58s)]
*  So did you figure out where you messed up? [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7369.58s)]
*  Never, never, never figured it out. To this day, are you kind of [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7371.58s)]
*  confused about it? Confused. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7373.58s)]
*  You think he just lied? [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7375.58s)]
*  I don't know if he had a psychotic break. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7377.58s)]
*  I don't know. I can't explain it. I mean, it must make you [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7379.58s)]
*  handshot going into the effect another time. So that's [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7381.58s)]
*  what's nerve wracking. Because if you go on [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7383.58s)]
*  TV, I did one before the Super Bowl one time. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7385.58s)]
*  And like before the Super Bowl, I had [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7387.58s)]
*  Coach Rex Ryan use a stopwatch. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7389.58s)]
*  How do you tell the coach, like, can you practice? [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7391.58s)]
*  Do you know how to use a stopwatch? He goes, yeah, of course I know how. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7393.58s)]
*  I'm like, just make sure you know how. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7395.58s)]
*  And he was supposed to time something. We did. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7397.58s)]
*  And it was a big part of it was to time it. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7399.58s)]
*  And he fat fingered it. So like when he hit it, he hit it [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7401.58s)]
*  twice. So we did all this stuff. How much time was it? [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7403.58s)]
*  He goes, oh, it's at one second. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7405.58s)]
*  I think I hit it twice. I'm like, what the fuck? [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7407.58s)]
*  So what do you do? [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7409.58s)]
*  So you have to think [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7411.58s)]
*  really quick on your feet with tens of millions of people [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7413.58s)]
*  watching. And? And I pulled it out. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7415.58s)]
*  But I didn't think it was great. It was suboptimal. It was like a plan B. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7417.58s)]
*  But I always plan for everything that can go wrong. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7419.58s)]
*  And I never thought [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7421.58s)]
*  that an NFL coach [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7423.58s)]
*  would not use the timer correctly. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7425.58s)]
*  Former NFL coach did his chair. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7427.58s)]
*  I don't blame it. It's not his fault. But man, oh, man, [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7429.58s)]
*  did it throw me under the bus. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7431.58s)]
*  Did it ruin the trick? No, it just ruined the phase. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7433.58s)]
*  Got it. So again, I [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7435.58s)]
*  tried to sweep that under the rug real quick, [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7437.58s)]
*  focus on the other stuff. But people are like, some people are like, [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7439.58s)]
*  well, what happened to the timer? It's like [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7441.58s)]
*  OK, for that final reveal [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7443.58s)]
*  right there, what if they all chose? What if [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7445.58s)]
*  he chose L, he chose L, and he chose [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7447.58s)]
*  G? That could have very [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7449.58s)]
*  real happened. What would you have done? [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7451.58s)]
*  Wouldn't have worked. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7453.58s)]
*  That's the whole [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7455.58s)]
*  beauty of it. You never know. He primes me to pick an L. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7457.58s)]
*  He knows I'm here. He primes him to pick a G. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7459.58s)]
*  He primes him. How? I don't [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7461.58s)]
*  know. Has anything ever gone wrong [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7463.58s)]
*  in a public setting and one of your [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7465.58s)]
*  mentalist friends hits you on the side and goes, yo, [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7467.58s)]
*  I saw like good save. And [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7469.58s)]
*  no one else picked it up. But yes. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7471.58s)]
*  I have some people that work [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7473.58s)]
*  on shows that are like an assistant that's not [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7475.58s)]
*  really doing anything but that's watching, like [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7477.58s)]
*  a video person who, [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7479.58s)]
*  I had like a residency for two years, who [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7481.58s)]
*  seen the show a hundred times. Look at my wife [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7483.58s)]
*  back in the day would see the show. And so [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7485.58s)]
*  once she's seen the show enough, she can tell the rhythms [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7487.58s)]
*  and she can see when something [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7489.58s)]
*  goes wrong. She doesn't watch my show anymore ever, but [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7491.58s)]
*  she used to. And so. Isn't it funny how tired [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7493.58s)]
*  of it they get? Oh my god. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7495.58s)]
*  Especially when you pretend like something [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7497.58s)]
*  just happened off the cuff. And you're like, oh, [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7499.58s)]
*  you're like, oh no, I know that's a bit you do every [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7501.58s)]
*  time. And my wife recently to come [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7503.58s)]
*  if you want to come to the show, she goes, literally [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7505.58s)]
*  I would rather do anything else in the world. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7507.58s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7509.58s)]
*  Also she knows you. She's seen it a thousand times. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7511.58s)]
*  You know what I mean? I spoke to a magician friend [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7513.58s)]
*  and I asked if he knew another person that was a little [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7515.58s)]
*  bit farther along in their career. And he goes, oh, I actually [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7517.58s)]
*  helped with his show. Oh, yeah. And I was [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7519.58s)]
*  like, what does that mean? He's like, ah, you know, [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7521.58s)]
*  I just help out. Are you able to inform [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7523.58s)]
*  me a little more? What does that mean when a younger [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7525.58s)]
*  magician helps out with a bigger [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7527.58s)]
*  magician's show? Because he wants to do that. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7529.58s)]
*  Is this a interview right now that we're having for a job? [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7531.58s)]
*  The internal dynamics of [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7533.58s)]
*  comedians is very obvious to me because I've been [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7535.58s)]
*  in the game so long. But for magicians, how does it work? [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7537.58s)]
*  Like you would see someone's effect and say, oh, [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7539.58s)]
*  you should actually add this to tighten it. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7541.58s)]
*  For sure. Just like that. I would look at the structure. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7543.58s)]
*  Punch up the effect, structure it differently. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7545.58s)]
*  Kind of all the things [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7547.58s)]
*  surrounding it. So [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7549.58s)]
*  I'm a big presentation based guy. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7551.58s)]
*  So when I go on, like I was on ESPN [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7553.58s)]
*  this morning, and I go on and [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7555.58s)]
*  I'm like, oh, I'm going to do this. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7557.58s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm going to do this. I had a [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7559.58s)]
*  really cool show. I was on ESPN this morning. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7561.58s)]
*  And I go on and the whole thing was themed around the fact [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7563.58s)]
*  that it's the NBA playoffs. It's the finals. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7565.58s)]
*  I'm not going to go on ESPN and do, no offense, [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7567.58s)]
*  like, a trick about Fanta and [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7569.58s)]
*  Scrabble tiles. It doesn't make sense. This came together for [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7571.58s)]
*  you as a custom designed piece. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7573.58s)]
*  It makes it interesting, right? And stuff that's a little more [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7575.58s)]
*  risque in this room versus if I go for a [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7577.58s)]
*  corporate. So I would watch [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7579.58s)]
*  and see what's the story you're telling. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7581.58s)]
*  Because most people that do what I do [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7583.58s)]
*  and the reason that they can't really get to a certain [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7585.58s)]
*  look at me and what I can do. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7587.58s)]
*  Yeah, it's not about the audience. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7588.86s)]
*  It's not about the audience. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7589.7s)]
*  So when you make it about the audience, [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7591.46s)]
*  you can expand your reach. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7593.46s)]
*  That's why, like, I've been on CNBC several dozen times. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7595.0599999999995s)]
*  Nobody ever, no other magician or mentalist [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7598.82s)]
*  ever has been on that network. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7600.98s)]
*  How can that be? [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7602.34s)]
*  It's like one of those crazy things, doesn't make sense. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7603.3s)]
*  You'd always think there'd be outliers. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7605.14s)]
*  It's not just because I worked on Wall Street. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7606.62s)]
*  There's other mentalists who've worked on Wall Street. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7607.94s)]
*  How long did you prepare your Joe Rogan trick [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7609.7s)]
*  with the envelope? [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7613.0199999999995s)]
*  And then how long do you prepare this flagrant thing? [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7613.86s)]
*  Ooh, is this like to decide which podcast? [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7616.58s)]
*  No, not at all. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7618.94s)]
*  I'm just curious. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7619.78s)]
*  No, we know the answer to that. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7620.62s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7621.78s)]
*  Love you, Shaws. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7623.26s)]
*  The Rogan has been in the back of my head for several years [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7625.34s)]
*  because I have been assessing Joe [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7628.54s)]
*  and I also listened to that podcast for a really long time. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7631.5s)]
*  Big into the alien stuff. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7634.5s)]
*  I listened to you guys for a while too, for the record. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7635.58s)]
*  But it was more of a, what would I do with Joe [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7637.46s)]
*  if I got in that room? [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7640.54s)]
*  Also, this is so much easier because there's four of you. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7641.62s)]
*  One-on-one is brutal. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7646.900000000001s)]
*  It's brutal. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7648.9800000000005s)]
*  Nothing to play off of. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7650.06s)]
*  There's nothing to play off of. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7650.900000000001s)]
*  There's no, it's a stone wall. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7653.66s)]
*  You can't distract us. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7655.900000000001s)]
*  There's no setup. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7656.860000000001s)]
*  There's no, like I got there and there was zero. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7657.860000000001s)]
*  You can't do anything. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7659.9400000000005s)]
*  It's like we got in there, get in the studio. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7660.9800000000005s)]
*  Like, oh, you know, so. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7663.62s)]
*  Oh, wow, okay. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7664.740000000001s)]
*  I mean, not in a bad way. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7665.58s)]
*  I'm not saying it was mean. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7666.54s)]
*  It was just, there's no real, there's no foreplay. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7667.38s)]
*  Yes. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7669.42s)]
*  So you can't really learn a lot beforehand. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7670.26s)]
*  Very little. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7672.26s)]
*  My interaction with Joe was minuscule [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7673.38s)]
*  before we were on air. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7675.5s)]
*  But the idea about the ATM PIN code [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7677.22s)]
*  happened potentially years ago. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7679.02s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I do that a lot though. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7680.62s)]
*  The ATM PIN code. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7681.66s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7682.5s)]
*  You haven't seen them. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7683.34s)]
*  I explained to him how to maybe. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7684.18s)]
*  He gives him an envelope at the beginning of the episode. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7685.22s)]
*  I saw the clip, yeah. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7687.06s)]
*  The 14 is crazy. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7687.9s)]
*  He doesn't believe that he gave anything away [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7689.34s)]
*  by what he said. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7691.9s)]
*  And it was, I didn't want to be confrontational. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7692.74s)]
*  I'm like, that's what I do. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7694.94s)]
*  I reverse engineer. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7696.18s)]
*  So in a lot of instances, [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7698.02s)]
*  you're like, you couldn't reverse engineer. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7699.22s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, you could though. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7700.22s)]
*  Because if I suddenly told you [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7701.78s)]
*  how many six letter names are there [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7703.38s)]
*  that could be for a female, [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7704.86s)]
*  but that could also be for a boy [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7706.139999999999s)]
*  because he was confused when I said, [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7707.54s)]
*  look up how popular this name is. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7708.74s)]
*  And he'd go, well, it could go either way. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7709.58s)]
*  Now there's a much limited set of names that could be. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7711.74s)]
*  Is it Patty? [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7714.62s)]
*  Is it like there's all different ways? [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7716.179999999999s)]
*  And now once I knew R and D, [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7717.58s)]
*  which he doesn't believe, [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7718.94s)]
*  but I knew the D, I figured out the R six letters. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7719.78s)]
*  If you literally put it in a computer, [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7721.86s)]
*  there's six names at that point. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7723.82s)]
*  And now you could stack which ones are the most popular. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7725.38s)]
*  How do I do it? [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7728.0199999999995s)]
*  People don't believe it, [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7729.099999999999s)]
*  but I figure things out. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7730.0599999999995s)]
*  It's not a psychic power. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7731.86s)]
*  Can you turn this off? [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7734.1s)]
*  I usually don't have it on. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7735.58s)]
*  It takes, it's like- [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7737.700000000001s)]
*  Okay, let's say hypothetically you have five kids. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7738.54s)]
*  You ask your oldest like, oh, did you brush your teeth? [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7740.9400000000005s)]
*  And they lie. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7743.38s)]
*  Oh, I know if they're lying, easy. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7744.22s)]
*  And then do you point it out? [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7745.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, oh yeah. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7747.14s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7747.9800000000005s)]
*  So it's always on. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7748.820000000001s)]
*  I think most parents know that. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7749.660000000001s)]
*  Can't you tell? [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7751.900000000001s)]
*  You can tell their rhythms. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7752.900000000001s)]
*  You can benchmark people pretty easy. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7753.860000000001s)]
*  That's like part of my book is how do you, [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7756.14s)]
*  because the best way to analyze is I can't just right now say, [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7758.38s)]
*  all right, tell me everything. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7762.02s)]
*  Tell me how you do it. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7763.38s)]
*  You can't, because you have to compare people to themselves, [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7764.22s)]
*  not to other people. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7767.82s)]
*  Anyone who tells you otherwise goes, NLP, you look up here. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7769.18s)]
*  This does this, this is, it's flowery. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7771.62s)]
*  It's not true. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7773.5s)]
*  It's the same with like a lot of body language reading. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7774.42s)]
*  Yes, there's patterns, but once you know how it works, [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7777.02s)]
*  you need to compare people to themselves. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7780.5s)]
*  Right. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7782.38s)]
*  Do you understand? [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7783.22s)]
*  It's the same way that blood doping. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7784.06s)]
*  That's your baseline. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7784.88s)]
*  You have a baseline. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7785.72s)]
*  You have to have a baseline. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7786.54s)]
*  And the more time you're around people, [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7787.58s)]
*  that's why I told you the Rogan was hard. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7789.14s)]
*  I wasn't around him that much. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7790.26s)]
*  And I needed to hook people in [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7791.7s)]
*  because that's a long podcast where I felt like [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7793.54s)]
*  if I don't do something cool at the beginning, [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7795.0599999999995s)]
*  people go, I don't know who this guy is, boom, next, next. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7797.339999999999s)]
*  So I need to hook you in instantly [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7800.0199999999995s)]
*  and have you stay around till the end. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7801.82s)]
*  Your new book, Read Your Mind comes out October 28th. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7804.0599999999995s)]

*  What is the best place? [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7815.339999999999s)]
*  My website. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7816.179999999999s)]

*  Everywhere. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7817.86s)]
*  It's Oz the Mentos. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7818.679999999999s)]
*  Mine looks like, it looks like Oz. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7819.5199999999995s)]
*  It should be Oz. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7820.36s)]
*  It's OzPirlman.com. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7821.2s)]
*  It's OzP-E-A-R-L-M-A-N.com. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7822.54s)]
*  But everything go on social. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7825.38s)]
*  It's at OzTheMentalist. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7826.38s)]
*  That's where all my stuff is. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7828.34s)]
*  And then the book itself. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7829.18s)]
*  Is it, obviously you're not divulging this information. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7831.94s)]
*  Are you showcasing how it can be helpful [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7835.62s)]
*  for you in your life? [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7837.62s)]
*  I call it proven habits for success. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7838.46s)]
*  So it's more self-help if you will. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7840.14s)]
*  If you were to take that book, [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7841.78s)]
*  How to Win Friends and Influence People, [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7842.62s)]
*  which is honestly one of the best books [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7844.34s)]
*  I've ever read in my life. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7845.58s)]
*  And I'm not saying that book is dated. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7846.94s)]
*  It's terrific. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7848.74s)]
*  Everything it does still stands to this day. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7849.58s)]
*  But if you put that through the lens of somebody [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7852.02s)]
*  whose entire job is to read people for a living [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7853.620000000001s)]
*  and see what tactical advantages I can give you [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7856.9400000000005s)]
*  on how to supercharge your memory. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7860.02s)]
*  Memory's one of those things where you don't realize [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7861.540000000001s)]
*  how much of what I'm doing right now relies on memory [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7862.84s)]
*  and awareness of things and remembering them. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7865.580000000001s)]
*  And honestly, in my life, [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7868.18s)]
*  people give me credit for reading their minds [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7870.1s)]
*  and half the time it's purely memory. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7871.88s)]
*  I just know a lot of stuff. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7873.34s)]
*  What is that thing called? [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7874.660000000001s)]
*  It's like a memory palace or something like that. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7875.820000000001s)]
*  What does that term? [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7878.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7879.660000000001s)]
*  You build stories? [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7880.9s)]
*  I don't know if that's what it is. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7882.02s)]
*  Memory palace, like moving through a physical space [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7883.22s)]
*  and then ascribing different ideas to rooms [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7885.5s)]
*  in order to memorize. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7888.26s)]
*  So you can do that. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7889.1s)]
*  That's more complicated. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7889.94s)]
*  Is that what you're doing or not? [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7890.76s)]
*  No, my stuff is, that's so much more complex. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7891.6s)]
*  I like to dumb it down. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7893.34s)]
*  The whole book is techniques you will master in 10 minutes [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7894.52s)]
*  and still be doing in 10 years. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7897.7s)]
*  Like anything that you go, oh, I gotta do this, [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7899.6s)]
*  I gotta do that, I gotta journal, screw that. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7901.62s)]
*  I want things that are easy, compact, [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7903.42s)]
*  that you can do, not like hear about and not do. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7905.82s)]
*  What's a thing that we can supercharge our memories? [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7908.98s)]
*  I'll tell you right now. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7910.86s)]
*  So memory, one of the big ones, [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7911.7s)]
*  this is a good one for people in day-to-day life. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7913.099999999999s)]
*  You meet a lot of people, right? [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7914.94s)]
*  You all meet a lot of people in your industry. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7916.339999999999s)]
*  How often have you met somebody and three seconds later, [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7918.98s)]
*  you don't know their name. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7921.98s)]
*  99% of the time. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7922.82s)]
*  Right? [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7923.66s)]
*  And so it's very awkward. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7924.48s)]
*  In many instances, you can avoid it and be like, [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7925.5s)]
*  oh, my guy, my guy right here. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7926.98s)]
*  Or you try to find somebody near to like introduce, [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7929.219999999999s)]
*  be like, oh, this is Andrew. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7931.299999999999s)]
*  And you're like, nice to meet you. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7932.299999999999s)]
*  You're like, nice to meet you. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7933.58s)]
*  So that I can make disappear forever. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7935.86s)]
*  So I did this in a Ted talk and I explained it this way. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7939.74s)]
*  You want a hook, you want something you can remember, [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7942.58s)]
*  the back of every bottle of shampoo says three words, [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7944.62s)]
*  lather, rinse, repeat. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7949.139999999999s)]
*  Have you heard that? [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7951.42s)]
*  Lather, rinse, repeat. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7952.5s)]
*  Lather, rinse, repeat. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7953.42s)]
*  Here's what I call it. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7956.0199999999995s)]
*  I call it listen, repeat, reply. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7956.86s)]
*  Remember that, listen, repeat, reply. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7958.66s)]
*  The first reason that you are not remembering [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7960.7s)]
*  someone's name has nothing to do with memory. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7963.36s)]
*  You never knew it to begin with. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7965.0599999999995s)]
*  You're not even listening to it. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7966.139999999999s)]
*  You never knew it to begin with. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7966.98s)]
*  I just wanna get the handshake right. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7967.82s)]
*  You gotta get the handshake right, that's key. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7969.5s)]
*  You miss web to web, what's fucking going on? [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7971.18s)]
*  Oh, done, done. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7972.66s)]
*  And you've got an L written on your hand right now. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7973.82s)]
*  They've got a woman's hand. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7976.62s)]
*  It's just a whole fucking. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7977.62s)]
*  There are short fingers, [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7978.94s)]
*  but you have other good attributes Akash. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7979.78s)]
*  Don't put yourself down. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7981.099999999999s)]
*  Is that you need to listen to the name. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7983.099999999999s)]
*  The number one thing I can take away is 95% of the time, [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7984.78s)]
*  if you make your mind a blank, right when you look at them [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7986.82s)]
*  and you take that name, you instantly repeat it. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7988.74s)]
*  Listen, repeat. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7992.22s)]
*  So I go, Alex, is that Alex? [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7993.48s)]
*  That's so funny. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7995.38s)]
*  So right away I say the name twice more. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7996.22s)]
*  At that point, Alex, great to meet you, Alex. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=7998.62s)]
*  You say it twice, your chances right away of forgetting it [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8000.62s)]
*  have already gone down by about 90%. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8002.9s)]
*  So right away. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8005.0199999999995s)]
*  And if you can, listen, make your mind a blank. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8005.86s)]
*  Do not think about what you're gonna say next. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8009.099999999999s)]
*  That's what everybody does. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8011.0599999999995s)]
*  Oh, you're jarred. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8012.82s)]
*  Listen, repeat the name at least twice and then reply. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8014.86s)]
*  Reply is some sort of hook. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8018.139999999999s)]
*  So one of the big ones is a compliment. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8020.46s)]
*  Be like, Alex, man, I love that necklace, Alex. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8022.0199999999995s)]
*  Where'd you get that necklace, Alex? [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8024.0599999999995s)]
*  You say it two more times [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8025.179999999999s)]
*  and now you've connected it with something physical. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8026.22s)]
*  Alex with the necklace. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8028.18s)]
*  Now I'm not trying to remember your name for days, [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8029.820000000001s)]
*  but I will remember you for the next 10 or 15 minutes. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8031.820000000001s)]
*  Another good one, compliment is one, [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8035.02s)]
*  how do you spell it, Akash? [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8037.1s)]
*  Is it A-K-A-S-H or double A in the middle? [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8038.58s)]
*  Akash, I don't know a lot of Akash's that spell it that way. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8041.54s)]
*  Now I've got the spelling. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8043.62s)]
*  Or the third one is you create some sort of connection [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8045.46s)]
*  where I'm like, Mark, dude, that's so funny, man. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8049.22s)]
*  My husband's name Mark, that's so hilarious. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8051.76s)]
*  And I go, my sister's husband is not named Mark. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8054.3s)]
*  Total liar, but now I'm gonna remember you. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8056.26s)]
*  You do something and this is a trick [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8058.66s)]
*  that I've shown it to people for years. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8060.46s)]
*  And if you just try this today with somebody, [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8062.46s)]
*  you'll see right away, you don't forget their name. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8064.78s)]
*  You will remember their name for the next, [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8066.78s)]
*  at least 10, 15 minutes, typically for the next few hours. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8069.5s)]
*  And that will get you out of that social situation. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8073.14s)]
*  Get you out of that situation. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8075.26s)]
*  And then a lot of other tricks [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8076.1s)]
*  on how to read people effectively, how to time things, [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8077.14s)]
*  how in those situations, same way in a restaurant, [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8079.66s)]
*  how I learned to know what people are thinking [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8081.76s)]
*  and use it to your advantage, how do you do that at home? [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8084.02s)]
*  How do you do that in relationships? [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8086.06s)]
*  Yeah, I'm so curious with this opening statement. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8087.22s)]
*  The opening statement is one. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8091.02s)]
*  I think that's massive. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8092.42s)]
*  Do you talk a lot about that in the book? [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8093.34s)]
*  A lot, how to set the tone. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8094.18s)]
*  I think that's so interesting. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8095.02s)]
*  I think that's great for just socialization in general [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8096.3s)]
*  and building momentum in a social environment. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8099.660000000001s)]
*  I think a lot of people can get crippled. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8102.080000000001s)]
*  I remember just being younger, [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8104.38s)]
*  you're going out for the first time. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8105.5s)]
*  If I walked up to a girl when I first walked into a bar, [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8106.580000000001s)]
*  even if it didn't go well, I just got the monkey off my back. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8110.72s)]
*  It was so much easier for me to socialize it. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8113.58s)]
*  But if I just held up the wall for about 15, 20 minutes. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8115.42s)]
*  You're locked in that you're frozen. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8118.18s)]
*  Exactly, yeah. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8119.58s)]
*  So it's like building that social momentum is so crucial. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8120.58s)]
*  And just having little tricks of the trade [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8124.7s)]
*  to help with that, wow, that's really great. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8126.54s)]
*  I like that idea of not imposing yourself [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8128.78s)]
*  on a group of people, not only through body language, [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8132.0599999999995s)]
*  but even the way that you're talking. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8134.2s)]
*  And not creating these like yes or no questions. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8136.14s)]
*  What was it that was it open? [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8139.14s)]
*  Open-ended, something that gives people. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8140.68s)]
*  And giving value. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8142.18s)]
*  It was like dopamine, curiosity, and open-ended, right? [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8143.580000000001s)]
*  Can you give another example just in life? [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8146.34s)]
*  It doesn't have to be with Magic Trick. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8148.22s)]
*  It's like, what would be, you're walking up there, [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8149.42s)]
*  you see a group of us in a park or something like that. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8151.820000000001s)]
*  You just kind of, you're in a new country, [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8153.740000000001s)]
*  you want to say hi, maybe meet some friends. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8155.3s)]
*  What would you say? [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8156.700000000001s)]
*  So you mean just an opening line to meet people. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8158.34s)]
*  I know you're reading people in the moment. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8160.18s)]
*  I know, for performance, I don't know. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8161.900000000001s)]
*  For social situations, I always like to point out [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8163.46s)]
*  the obvious. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8166.22s)]
*  So if you're in a situation, think about this. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8167.18s)]
*  Why is it that if you're in an elevator, right? [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8168.820000000001s)]
*  Especially if you're in Manhattan, [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8171.26s)]
*  you'll never talk to anyone. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8172.3s)]
*  But if that elevator gets stuck, [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8173.46s)]
*  we're chatting it up. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8175.900000000001s)]
*  Five minutes later, you're best friends, right? [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8176.74s)]
*  Everybody knows that. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8177.78s)]
*  Why is that? [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8178.62s)]
*  Or you're in a subway. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8179.4400000000005s)]
*  Why is there this release that when everyone's [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8180.28s)]
*  in a situation together, we now open up socially, right? [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8182.5s)]
*  There's some sort of thing that changes in us. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8185.9800000000005s)]
*  Why didn't we say that before? [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8188.3s)]
*  Is it because of the time limit? [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8189.3s)]
*  It's because we were only gonna spend 20 seconds [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8190.46s)]
*  in the elevator, and now we might be in it for two minutes. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8192.54s)]
*  They were like, oh man, can you believe this crap? [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8195.1s)]
*  Oh, where is he? [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8196.9s)]
*  You open up to those people. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8197.72s)]
*  There's something about it. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8199.26s)]
*  So I think there's something to be said [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8200.380000000001s)]
*  where I've been in a lot of parent environments [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8202.1s)]
*  with other parents at a school, [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8204.9s)]
*  and it's like, you don't know these people. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8206.66s)]
*  What are you really gonna say to them? [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8208.1s)]
*  And I think you just go in there, [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8209.3s)]
*  and rather than do the regular small talk, [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8210.5s)]
*  oh, what's your kid? [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8212.14s)]
*  What's your this? [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8212.96s)]
*  If you can say something that nobody's really thought of [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8214.66s)]
*  about the school and be like, [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8216.74s)]
*  I absolutely love this about the school. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8218.1s)]
*  How do you feel about that? [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8219.78s)]
*  And it gives you something to run with, and it's positive. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8220.699999999999s)]
*  I try to go with positive energy rather than negative energy [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8223.4s)]
*  because that's typically what I do. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8226.22s)]
*  I try to point out positive things and give open-ended [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8228.46s)]
*  to see if they agree, and if they don't, [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8231.18s)]
*  well, we have some fun riffing there too. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8232.82s)]
*  Right, right. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8234.66s)]
*  But that's what I've done rather than just, [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8235.5s)]
*  hey, what's your name? [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8236.78s)]
*  What do you work? [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8237.62s)]
*  What do you do? [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8238.44s)]
*  Like, I don't want, because I don't want to ask, [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8239.28s)]
*  then they ask me what I do, [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8240.12s)]
*  and I don't want to go down that path. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8240.960000000001s)]
*  I try to avoid as much as possible. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8242.7s)]
*  I can see that. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8244.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I've heard that asking really finite questions [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8246.02s)]
*  is challenging for people, [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8249.18s)]
*  and then asking open-ended or time-based questions [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8250.300000000001s)]
*  is actually more helpful. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8252.92s)]
*  So instead of asking you, what's your favorite movie? [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8253.76s)]
*  Right. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8256.34s)]
*  Saying, what are some movies you like? [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8257.18s)]
*  Or what is the most recent movie you've seen? [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8258.7s)]
*  It's typically easier for someone to answer [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8260.900000000001s)]
*  and creates more lubrication socially. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8262.820000000002s)]
*  That's a time-based question? [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8264.900000000001s)]
*  Like, what is the most recent movie you've seen? [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8266.18s)]
*  Yeah, what's the first movie [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8267.580000000002s)]
*  that made a big impression on you? [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8268.42s)]
*  That's a good one. [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8270.42s)]
*  And so it can create a little bit less apprehension [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8271.26s)]
*  where it's your favorite movie, [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8273.900000000001s)]
*  you're just sitting there like, ah, man, I don't know, [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8275.1s)]
*  and then it creates kind of like a stall man. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8278.7s)]
*  A barrier a little bit. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8282.02s)]
*  What if you're starting a show? [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8282.86s)]
*  What would your opening line be when you start a show? [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8284.1s)]
*  Well, my opening line is pretty much, [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8287.94s)]
*  is acknowledging the fact, [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8289.42s)]
*  the obvious statement between me and the audience, [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8290.7s)]
*  which they'll see my sizzle reel, my hype reel, [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8292.98s)]
*  and I go, I see it, and you know what? [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8295.28s)]
*  I'm calling BS. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8297.54s)]
*  Like, I just want to, everyone in the audience sees this, [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8298.38s)]
*  and what do you think? [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8301.14s)]
*  There's no way this is right, right? [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8302.18s)]
*  I can't read minds. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8303.38s)]
*  That's why I say, I can't read minds. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8304.34s)]
*  I read people. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8305.960000000001s)]
*  That's what you said, like, [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8306.88s)]
*  if you're gonna have all this flowery language, [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8307.74s)]
*  you're not gonna break the fourth wall. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8309.22s)]
*  I'm gonna break the fourth wall and say to you, [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8310.2s)]
*  I learned how to do this. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8312.18s)]
*  I've trained myself for years. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8313.94s)]
*  This is a skill, not some sort of ethereal gift, [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8315.14s)]
*  light didn't shine upon me. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8318.380000000001s)]
*  I've taken a set of skills and I've developed them, [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8319.9s)]
*  and a lot of them are transferable to other people, [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8322.18s)]
*  and it's kind of like music. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8324.26s)]
*  Some people are incredible at playing the guitar [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8325.74s)]
*  or the piano. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8327.58s)]
*  They have an innate gift, but it's not supernatural. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8328.6s)]
*  Jimi Hendrix could do that. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8331.02s)]
*  So the same thing applies where people could do [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8332.78s)]
*  what I'm doing, but most of them won't put in the time, [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8335.72s)]
*  get through the hard bumps, [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8338.14s)]
*  because I wasn't as good years ago, I can assure you. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8339.42s)]
*  If you would've seen it, things would've gone wrong. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8341.42s)]
*  This would've, and like, it's really tough to get over [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8343.3s)]
*  when you screw up a lot. [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8345.26s)]
*  That's why there's less mentalists. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8347.34s)]
*  There's more magicians, because of exactly that reason. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8349.06s)]
*  He can tell you, magic tricks, [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8352.1s)]
*  if you practice them endlessly, they typically work. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8353.94s)]
*  You can perfect them on your own. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8357.78s)]
*  Mentalism, what I just did for you, [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8360.26s)]
*  like the thing with the flagrant that said, [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8362.3s)]
*  I've never done before, I've never ever done it before, [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8363.7s)]
*  and I will never do it again. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8366.06s)]
*  So all of it was thought out in advance, [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8367.62s)]
*  and it wasn't really practiced on anybody, [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8369.4s)]
*  I just practiced it in my mind over and over and over. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8370.82s)]
*  Thank you so much, brother, that was amazing. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8373.4s)]
*  Go check out his new book. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8375.24s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8376.380000000001s)]
*  Coming out, pre-order right now, [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8377.2s)]
*  Read Your Mind comes out October 28th. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8378.98s)]
*  Thank you so much, brother. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8381.54s)]
*  Thanks for having me, thanks for having me. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8382.86s)]
*  Flagrant. Great job. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8383.7s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8385.34s)]
*  Blast. This was awesome. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbHmn0bnhk&t=8386.58s)]
