# Trump Assassination Conspiracy, Israel vs Iran start World War 3, & Drake Wins Rap Beef
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [April 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM)
*  What's up, everybody? Welcome to Flaygrant. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=0.0s)]
*  And today we are going to begin [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1.7s)]
*  with an absolutely phenomenal conspiracy [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3.84s)]
*  that I heard over the weekend from the good folks over there [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6.88s)]
*  that ninjas are butterflies. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=9.68s)]
*  They came to the show in Jacksonville, man. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=10.84s)]
*  No fire. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=12.52s)]
*  We were chopping it up backstage in the green room. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=13.52s)]
*  I get them all sent down, I'm like, I need some heat. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=14.92s)]
*  Don't give me these, like, B or C level conspiracies. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  I need the number one ship right now. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=19.02s)]
*  He goes, uh, okay, you've been hearing a lot [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=21.16s)]
*  about the Boeing planes falling apart, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=22.96s)]
*  doors falling off, the planes aren't working, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=24.86s)]
*  the whistleblower that might have gotten murked, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=26.900000000000002s)]
*  and the public has been almost desensitized [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=29.1s)]
*  to Boeing planes falling apart. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  When I'm in a plane flying right now, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=33.4s)]
*  I'm like, is this Boeing? Like, I'm concerned. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=34.74s)]
*  And if a Boeing plane does fall apart, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=36.5s)]
*  that wouldn't blow my mind. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=38.300000000000004s)]
*  Well, you know whose jet happens to be a Boeing? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=39.64s)]
*  Take a wild guess. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=42.68s)]
*  Why don't Trump? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=43.68s)]
*  That's how they get him out of here. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=45.18000000000001s)]
*  If they can't, if they... [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  That's what he said. I was like, yo! [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=50.18000000000001s)]
*  Because if... God forbid, God forbid, God forbid. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=52.32s)]
*  God forbid we lose the great one. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=54.86s)]
*  God forbid we lose the next prize, you know? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=56.06s)]
*  But if, for example, Trump's plane went down [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=58.440000000000005s)]
*  and it was a Boeing, people wouldn't immediately go, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=62.92s)]
*  oh, they killed him. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=66.56s)]
*  They would go, of course it did. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=67.56s)]
*  It's a Boeing. These planes are going down nonstop. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=69.26s)]
*  Yeah. So are they inflating the fact [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=71.72s)]
*  that these Boeing planes are falling apart? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=74.2s)]
*  Are Boeing planes falling apart more than Airbus? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=75.86s)]
*  We don't even know. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=79.04s)]
*  We just right now expect Boeing to fall the fuck apart. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=80.14s)]
*  And if they can't get him out of here [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=82.94s)]
*  and it looks like he's going to win the election, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=84.54s)]
*  he has to fly to Iowa or something, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=86.34s)]
*  plane goes down, see you later, Trump. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=88.4s)]
*  We blame Boeing. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=90.0s)]
*  Wow. That's heat. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=91.3s)]
*  Admit that's heat. Now listen. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=92.86s)]
*  Here's the thing about... [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  Hold on, let me add. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=94.94s)]
*  Didn't Boeing get bailed out back in the day? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=95.94s)]
*  So the government could be like, hey, we bailed the fuck out. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=98.08s)]
*  You got to bail us out. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=100.84s)]
*  You're going to take a little hit, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=101.64s)]
*  but we already gave you your money. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=102.58s)]
*  Yeah. This is the beautiful thing about conspiracy theories. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=103.98s)]
*  It's basically, it's comedy without humor. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=106.98s)]
*  But it's connecting two things that definitely have nothing [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=111.76s)]
*  to do with one another and making it seem as if they do. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=114.52000000000001s)]
*  And you're like, oh my God. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=117.2s)]
*  And the pressure is off to be funny. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=117.88s)]
*  You just have to make it somewhat logical. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=119.17999999999999s)]
*  OK. Listen, guys, what else is going on in the world? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=120.88s)]
*  We got abortion. They're taking it away in Arizona. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=123.82s)]
*  Like, what's what's the vibe? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=126.32s)]
*  So Arizona had a law in 1864. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=127.52s)]
*  OK. That abortion was illegal. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=131.06s)]
*  No exceptions for incest at any time from the moment of conception. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=134.56s)]
*  And the only exception that was allowed [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=139.44s)]
*  is if the mother's life is in danger. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=141.78s)]
*  This law is from like 60 years before Arizona was even a state. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=143.7s)]
*  I think 1912, Arizona became a state. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=146.9s)]
*  So it's an old law that also to be to give context. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=148.9s)]
*  And I don't know how much. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=153.5s)]
*  But back then, moment of conception, they found out much later. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=154.1s)]
*  They didn't have the technology that we have now to find out. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=158.18s)]
*  You pee on a stick and then you find out three weeks in. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=160.72s)]
*  So that's that's one. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=162.78s)]
*  So a month. They find out a month. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=164.28s)]
*  Yeah, I heard maybe even later. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=166.28s)]
*  I think I heard a couple of months. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=167.38s)]
*  But if you miss a period, maybe. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=168.32s)]
*  But you could presume. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  So that law was there was an injunction on that law [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=171.16s)]
*  when Roe versus Wade passed, meaning this law is on pause. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=175.24s)]
*  Yeah. So 1977, whenever Roe versus Wade got passed, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=177.54s)]
*  then that law, there's an injunction. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=180.38s)]
*  And then since then, pro life groups have kind of been working to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=182.22s)]
*  chip away at abortion. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=187.66s)]
*  And then I think in 2002, they passed a 15 week ban. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=189.06s)]
*  So you can't get an abortion after 15 weeks. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=192.51999999999998s)]
*  I don't I think there was exceptions for rape and incest. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=195.62s)]
*  I don't remember that part exactly. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=198.12s)]
*  But then this Roe gets overturned with Donald Trump, who said, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=199.66s)]
*  I'm going to overturn Roe versus Wade. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=203.86s)]
*  I think it should be up to the states. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=205.56s)]
*  That's what he has said since 2016. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=207.16s)]
*  He didn't flip flop on this since 2016. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=209.16s)]
*  This should be a states rights issue. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=211.28s)]
*  We want to overturn Roe. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=212.72s)]
*  I will put pro life judges in the Supreme Court [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=214.02s)]
*  so that we can overturn Roe versus Wade and it can be a states rights issue. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=217.22s)]
*  Then in 2021 or 2022, Arizona passes a law [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=220.26s)]
*  that says abortion is illegal if like the child has like a genetic defect [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=225.26s)]
*  or you can't you can't. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=229.72s)]
*  And then also it gives human rights to fertilize embryos, eggs, fetuses. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=231.12s)]
*  Like from that moment, it's fertilized. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=236.52s)]
*  This is a human life. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=238.48s)]
*  So fertilization from fertilization, fertilized eggs, embryos, fetuses. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=239.72s)]
*  So I believe, yeah, same thing. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=243.76s)]
*  I'm just a bit regretting what I read, but also seems like the same thing logically. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=246.26s)]
*  So that law, I think the reason why I say that is because [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=250.18s)]
*  from fertilization to the embryonic stage, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=254.08s)]
*  a bunch of shit needs to happen where you lose a lot of eggs. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=256.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=259.46s)]
*  So that's why it's difficult for the fertility clinics to stay open [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=260.06s)]
*  if they're held responsible for those lives. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=264.52s)]
*  And I think that's why it's a tricky thing for them. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=266.66s)]
*  It's like it says fertilize eggs and embers, which again, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=268.98s)]
*  the fetus is very different than they're basically cause the fertilization clinics [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=271.42s)]
*  to close down because they don't want to hold the liability of 75 percent of your [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=274.92s)]
*  eggs. Yeah. And they're liable for all those deaths. Exactly. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=280.42s)]
*  OK, fuck. Yeah. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=283.12s)]
*  So there's multiple stages that these fertilized eggs go through [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=284.12s)]
*  before you can implant them. Right. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=287.68s)]
*  And through each stage, some people lose up to like 50 percent. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=289.29999999999995s)]
*  OK. So if the clinic is held responsible, since each fertilized egg is a life, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=293.44s)]
*  they'll go, well, nobody's going to ensure this if we're held responsible, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=298.14s)]
*  as if we actually killed one of these fertilized eggs. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=301.94s)]
*  Yeah. So in a way, the law gets rid of fertility clinics. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=304.7s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=308.59999999999997s)]
*  Hoof. That's tricky. OK. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=310.0s)]
*  Then the Supreme Court makes a ruling that says that 1864 law [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=311.73999999999995s)]
*  actually has precedent over all other abortion laws over Roe vs. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=316.36s)]
*  Wade over the 2002 15 week abortion ban. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=320.65999999999997s)]
*  So from now on, from the moment of conception, no exceptions for [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=324.2s)]
*  for instance. It's like illegal, illegal unless the mother's life is in danger. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=328.8s)]
*  Now, Trump and this could be a very smart pivot or it could be what he meant. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=332.86s)]
*  That's the House of Dragons rule where it's like basically if the baby's going to [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=337.46s)]
*  kill the mom. Yeah. You can make a choice. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=341.4s)]
*  Yes. Got it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=343.88s)]
*  OK. Yeah. Then you can do it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=345.74s)]
*  Which makes complete sense. Now, Trump, again, maybe this is what he always meant. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=347.68s)]
*  Or maybe it's a very smart pivot. He said, hey, when I said states rights, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=351.28s)]
*  I meant the citizens of the state should be allowed to vote on it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=354.98s)]
*  Arizona went too far because the Supreme Court ruled on something and didn't put [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=358.38s)]
*  in the people's hands. This is an Arizona Supreme Court ruling. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=362.42s)]
*  I think that's fair. Which makes sense. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=365.82s)]
*  Yeah. Now, it could be a very smart pivot of like. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=367.78s)]
*  Especially the judges are not appointed by the people. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=370.03999999999996s)]
*  So it's not going to be reflective of the democratic process. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=372.44s)]
*  Yes. Yes. Yeah. I don't like that at all. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=374.78000000000003s)]
*  Now, maybe when he said states rights, he was saying in 2016, maybe what he was [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=376.20000000000005s)]
*  selling is by any means necessary up to the state. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=379.8s)]
*  Maybe that's what he should be able to be changed by the state. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=382.44s)]
*  If the state wants to change, then that law should change. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=384.70000000000005s)]
*  And if I had to guess, Arizonians, I think they want to change that. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=387.70000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Knowing a couple of Arizonians. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=390.44s)]
*  I think they want. I think they want the scoops. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=393.5s)]
*  So the reason this has become such a touch point is because Arizona is the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=396.14000000000004s)]
*  biggest swing state that has such an intense ban. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=400.68s)]
*  I think Florida has passed and Georgia. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=404.8s)]
*  Florida is going to pass on May 1st in force and Georgia has passed six week [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=407.28000000000003s)]
*  abortion bans. So anything after six weeks? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=411.14s)]
*  And I believe that's snug, bro. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=414.48s)]
*  That's very snug. That's snug because your period can be a little late. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=416.6s)]
*  Like, yeah, you could also get it right after your period. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=420.48s)]
*  It's up to like seven or eight that it takes to sort of kick in and notice. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=423.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's snug. And that's snug. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=425.98s)]
*  They were good with that little 15 week or whatever. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=429.84s)]
*  15 weeks seems reasonable. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=431.84s)]
*  Why do you complain about that? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=433.64s)]
*  I don't know. You should know by then. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=436.23999999999995s)]
*  I'm sorry. If you don't know by then. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=438.14s)]
*  Yeah. 15 weeks seems very reasonable. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=441.23999999999995s)]
*  15 weeks? I think most people would find 15 weeks reasonable. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=443.34s)]
*  And I think that's what Trump wants to make. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=446.64s)]
*  He's saying I want to make that the national law 15 weeks, which seems reasonable. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=448.29999999999995s)]
*  You can even bring it down. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=452.2s)]
*  No, again, that's bring it down. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=453.64s)]
*  We can bring it down. Why? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=456.53999999999996s)]
*  I'm just saying we could. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=458.34s)]
*  Here's what I will say. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=460.09999999999997s)]
*  We could, but like you should know. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=461.5s)]
*  Like, there are people who like they don't. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=463.14s)]
*  Also a tough decision for people to make. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=465.03999999999996s)]
*  So sometimes you need a little time to think it over. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=467.4s)]
*  You might have a vacation plan. You don't know if it's going to happen. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=469.7s)]
*  Can you be honest? 15 weeks is a lot of time. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=471.94s)]
*  That's a lot of time. Sleep on it. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=473.73999999999995s)]
*  Asleep. That's a lot of time. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=475.34s)]
*  People don't say sleep on it. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=477.7s)]
*  Hey, hey, Alex, sleep on this decision for the next 105 days. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=478.9s)]
*  Nobody does that. Sleep on it 105 times. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=483.53999999999996s)]
*  105 days is crazy. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=485.9s)]
*  Put it like that. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=488.09999999999997s)]
*  Thank God I got the math right. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=489.59999999999997s)]
*  I just had to reconfirm it in my head. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=490.79999999999995s)]
*  105 days is crazy. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=492.0s)]
*  Yeah, but you don't even know until day 40. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=494.0s)]
*  So now that's shrunk to really 60 days. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=498.0s)]
*  65 days is crazy. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=502.2s)]
*  So I think 15 weeks. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=505.2s)]
*  You really need 30 days. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=506.0s)]
*  You really need 30. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=508.29999999999995s)]
*  It's like a refund to Best Buy or something. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=509.7s)]
*  No, sorry. You need 30 after the initial 40. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=511.29999999999995s)]
*  You really need a good 70 days. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=515.3000000000001s)]
*  10 week abortion. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=517.3000000000001s)]
*  Am I being honest? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=518.5s)]
*  10 week abortion. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=519.5s)]
*  Am I being honest? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=520.1s)]
*  You need 70. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=521.5s)]
*  You should be able to figure it out with this 70. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=522.3000000000001s)]
*  10 weeks. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=524.4000000000001s)]
*  That's it. Look at your man. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=525.2s)]
*  Do we got this? No? Yes? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=526.7s)]
*  Yeah, I think 15 weeks seems reasonable. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=529.8000000000001s)]
*  I think 10 weeks seems reasonable. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=532.2s)]
*  And then obviously for incest. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=533.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so there's no exceptions for incest. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=537.7s)]
*  I don't believe Florida, Georgia. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=540.1s)]
*  There's 14 states that have... [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=541.5s)]
*  Yeah, incest and ****. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=542.5s)]
*  You got to let them... [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=543.5s)]
*  Here's what's very funny. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=544.0s)]
*  Mississippi makes an exception for ****, but not incest. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=545.3s)]
*  That's far. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=548.6s)]
*  Like you're really playing into the stereotype of your state. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=549.1s)]
*  That's far. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=551.3s)]
*  When you're like, well incest, that could be love. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=551.8s)]
*  That's far. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=553.6s)]
*  That's so funny. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=554.5s)]
*  I like that. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=555.3s)]
*  Know your brand. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=556.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=557.1s)]
*  Know your brand. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=557.6s)]
*  I like that a lot. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=558.4s)]
*  It's a funny thing. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=559.1s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=559.8s)]
*  That's true. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=560.3s)]
*  No exception for incest, exception for ****. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=561.3s)]
*  Do you have to prove it's incest? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=564.4s)]
*  Like could you just go in and be like... [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=566.5s)]
*  But that's what's funny is there's so much incest that's not **** for them. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=567.6s)]
*  They can't bundle it up. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=571.7s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=572.7s)]
*  Most of the states, it's like getting your TV and internet the same pack. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=573.7s)]
*  It's the same. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=577.3000000000001s)]
*  Most states are probably just like... [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=577.9s)]
*  Incest is always ****. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=580.7s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=582.1s)]
*  So we could just put ****. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=583.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=584.5s)]
*  And then somebody had to go, I think we got to put incest as well. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=585.4s)]
*  Because there's some consensuals out there that want to get rid of it. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=589.3000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it is weird you have to put both. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=591.5s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=593.3000000000001s)]
*  It should just be ****. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=593.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=595.0s)]
*  And that falls under the umbrella. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=595.5s)]
*  You know what the worst part about it is? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=597.1s)]
*  The incest. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=598.3000000000001s)]
*  You're like, nah, I don't think so. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=599.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=600.1s)]
*  I think it's the **** part. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=601.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=603.9s)]
*  But this... [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=604.4s)]
*  Oh brother. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=604.9s)]
*  Brother, what is this? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=607.1999999999999s)]
*  Brother, oh. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=608.4s)]
*  Do you know that? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=610.0s)]
*  No. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=610.5s)]
*  Her reaction is great. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=611.0s)]
*  It's a grand. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=612.0s)]
*  Brother, oh. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=615.3s)]
*  Brother, oh. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=617.3s)]
*  This is... [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=618.1s)]
*  Okay, so. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=618.8s)]
*  So this is kind of, I think Democrats only hope to really win the election [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=620.0s)]
*  because they're all saying this is Trump's fault. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=623.8s)]
*  Even if Trump didn't push for this, he repealed Roe vs. Wade. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=626.6s)]
*  He put this in the state's hands. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=629.9s)]
*  This is what happens under Republican rule. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=631.6s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=633.7s)]
*  From what my experience in Arizona... [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=635.9s)]
*  They are like gun Republicans. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=641.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=644.7s)]
*  In that they're like, hey, we want freedom to have our guns. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=645.1s)]
*  We want freedom. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=649.4s)]
*  I don't even know if they care that much about like the government encroaching on their businesses [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=651.2s)]
*  and that kind of ****. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=654.8000000000001s)]
*  Like, I don't even know if they care that much. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=655.7s)]
*  I think they're just like, hey, we like guns. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=657.3000000000001s)]
*  Kind of libertarian vibes. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=659.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a little bit more like even to choose to live out there in the desert. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=660.3s)]
*  You're kind of like off the grid. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=664.0s)]
*  They're trying to abort themselves a little bit. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=667.0999999999999s)]
*  A little bit. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=668.4s)]
*  I don't think that that extends to... [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=669.5999999999999s)]
*  I don't think there's like religious conservatives. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=672.0s)]
*  So what they're trying to do is get it put on the ballot [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=674.9s)]
*  and if it gets put on the ballot, it will get voted down. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=677.0s)]
*  In the heartbeat. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=679.5s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=680.4s)]
*  And I think there are people who are trying to block it from getting put on the ballot [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=681.4s)]
*  on the conservative side. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=684.0999999999999s)]
*  And this is where Alex was saying it's kind of fracturing the conservative party. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=684.9s)]
*  Conservative party is getting more and more pro-choice [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=688.2s)]
*  and less and less like ardently pro-life. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=691.2s)]
*  So now you got these guys though who are like, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=693.5s)]
*  no, I did vote for this Republican guy or Trump or whoever [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=696.1s)]
*  because I thought you were going to outlaw abortion. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=699.9s)]
*  I'm a single issue voter. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=702.4s)]
*  That's the only **** thing that matters to me. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=703.5s)]
*  Now, I feel very betrayed that you're suddenly backtracking [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=705.3000000000001s)]
*  and like you might not feel it with Trump, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=708.2s)]
*  but Mitch McConnell was like, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=709.9s)]
*  I haven't seen anything on this ruling. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=711.5s)]
*  I don't know what's going on. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=713.1s)]
*  Like what a **** non-answer that was. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=714.1s)]
*  So you're looking at all of your leaders who you believed in [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=716.4s)]
*  and you might feel a way and now there's this kind of fracture [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=719.0s)]
*  and this issue is so polarizing and such a single issue thing. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=722.3s)]
*  I will vote based on this one thing that there does seem to be a splinter [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=725.8s)]
*  in the Republican Party. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=729.4s)]
*  Wow. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=730.3s)]
*  And this is the only chance this Democratic Party has to win, I think. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=730.6999999999999s)]
*  Because they're so **** weak and they don't stand on anything. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=733.9s)]
*  But what I can tell you is you don't want that. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=737.0s)]
*  And that's why it's becoming such a touch point and such a media issue. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=740.6999999999999s)]
*  So what do we think? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=743.5s)]
*  Sargogo. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=744.6999999999999s)]
*  The Attorney General also said, I'm not prosecuting anybody. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=745.2s)]
*  I'm not prosecuting a patient or provider under this draconian law, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=747.6s)]
*  as he called it. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=750.6s)]
*  You're so good at this. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=751.1s)]
*  You know so much ****. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=752.3000000000001s)]
*  When you apply yourself, you **** know. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=753.4000000000001s)]
*  I will forget. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=755.9000000000001s)]
*  You're like really good at that. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=757.1s)]
*  I will forget all of this within 48 hours. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=758.3000000000001s)]
*  But none of that matters because you know it now. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=760.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=762.4000000000001s)]
*  We recorded it. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=762.8000000000001s)]
*  It was good fun. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=763.3000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=763.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean you just know all these things. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=764.4000000000001s)]
*  He said Mitch McConnell. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=766.0s)]
*  I mean I tune out for you **** got it. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=767.0s)]
*  Like it was incredible. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=768.9000000000001s)]
*  As long as y'all think I know something. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=770.7s)]
*  You do know it. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=772.5s)]
*  You know all this. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=773.6s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=775.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=776.1s)]
*  I'm like blown away. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=776.8000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=778.3000000000001s)]
*  Did 1864 and all this other ****. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=778.8000000000001s)]
*  This is incredible. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=781.3000000000001s)]
*  I have a year wrong actually initially. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=782.1s)]
*  Somebody had to re-look it. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=783.4000000000001s)]
*  What was the right year? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=784.2s)]
*  I thought it was 1856 and it was 1864. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=785.1s)]
*  I just re-looked it up. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=786.9000000000001s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=787.7s)]
*  No, you said 1864. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=788.1s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=788.9000000000001s)]
*  But before in the bathroom break, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=789.3000000000001s)]
*  I was checking my notes and I was like. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=790.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=792.0s)]
*  We don't know about the bathroom break. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=792.7s)]
*  We know what you deliver to the people. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=794.2s)]
*  You're right. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=796.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=796.7s)]
*  This is incredible. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=797.4000000000001s)]
*  Delivery, son. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=798.5s)]
*  Yo. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=799.4000000000001s)]
*  Kill that ****. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=799.8000000000001s)]
*  70 days. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=800.4000000000001s)]
*  Shut up and make some drums. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=801.7s)]
*  I think 70 days is it. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=803.8s)]
*  70 day abortion ban. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=806.0s)]
*  Very reasonable. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=807.5s)]
*  Al, why so much? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=808.3s)]
*  What's the latest one you did? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=809.3s)]
*  Yo, what was your latest? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=814.3s)]
*  I'm serious. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=816.6999999999999s)]
*  Real talk. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=817.4s)]
*  As I was researching it, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=817.9s)]
*  I was like, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=819.5s)]
*  Al should have taken this down. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=819.9s)]
*  Because there's a pill. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=821.9s)]
*  I didn't know there's a pill you can take. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=823.0999999999999s)]
*  And then I was like, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=824.3s)]
*  that's probably how he got it every time. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=825.1999999999999s)]
*  For how many days? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=826.9s)]
*  Pill is crazy. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=827.9s)]
*  Wait, why is it? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=829.1999999999999s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=830.3s)]
*  It basically makes their body go through pregnancy. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=831.9s)]
*  Like it forces the contractions. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=835.6s)]
*  And so it's a painful process. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=837.6s)]
*  Definitely get the nice little vacuum. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=839.9s)]
*  Scoop, scoop. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=841.7s)]
*  Ay. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=842.4s)]
*  But that's most though. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=843.1s)]

*  Listen, so we take a minute and you just get half the time. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=947.7s)]

*  right? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=952.7s)]
*  And like you you chopped in like what you were accused of, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=953.0s)]
*  right is like chopping up their body into pieces and like [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=957.6s)]
*  putting it into a refrigerator and then like it came out. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=961.1s)]
*  It was only half the body, right? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=965.5s)]
*  Mini fridge. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=967.2s)]
*  Yeah, it would be one a smaller fridge, but you'd also be [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=968.1s)]
*  like I can't chop up the whole body. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=970.2s)]
*  Like it was two chops. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=972.4s)]
*  It wasn't even that many chops when you think about it, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=974.3000000000001s)]

*  Yeah, that's the example. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=991.0s)]
*  I would yeah if you kill someone that's like 109 is that [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=991.8000000000001s)]

*  Did I? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1121.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1122.5s)]
*  No, I don't know if I did. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1122.9s)]
*  Technically I did it. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1124.8s)]
*  I think I'm off to 10 weeks. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1126.0s)]
*  I think I'm right. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1127.5s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1129.3s)]
*  I think I'm right. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1129.8s)]
*  10 weeks makes mad sense. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1130.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1131.5s)]
*  10 weeks. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1132.1s)]
*  Are you saying it's still partial murder? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1132.5s)]
*  No, I'm saying you were very worried about saving. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1133.8s)]
*  I'm saying the murderer got saved by the bell. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1136.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1139.1s)]
*  The murderer got saved by the bell. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1139.7s)]
*  It's not murder. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1141.7s)]
*  It's Zack Morris murder. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1142.1s)]
*  This is why, oh my God, I threw this out there thinking that this wasn't going to work and we were going to like retrofit it, but it kind of does work. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1143.1s)]
*  You're saved by the bell, right? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1150.3s)]
*  You as the murderer get saved by the bell when you do it at 10 weeks. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1151.8999999999999s)]
*  You don't know if that pregnancy would make it all the way. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1155.0s)]
*  That's true. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1157.0s)]
*  So technically you are saved by the bell as a murder. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1157.6999999999998s)]
*  We can't call you a murderer because we don't know if you would have stayed knocked out or not. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1161.8s)]
*  You are saved by the bell. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1165.5s)]
*  10 weeks. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1166.8999999999999s)]
*  Saved by the bell. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1167.6s)]
*  I'm right, 10 weeks. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1168.3999999999999s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1169.1s)]
*  Whoa, not 10. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1169.5s)]
*  10. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1170.3999999999999s)]
*  Wait, what is 10? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1171.3s)]
*  70 days? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1171.8999999999999s)]
*  70 days. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1172.5s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that's fine. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1173.0s)]
*  Now 70 days is tight. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1176.8s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1178.8s)]
*  You're right. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1180.8s)]
*  70 days is fine. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1181.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1182.6s)]
*  I was thinking when you said 10 weeks, it was 6, but it's not. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1182.9s)]
*  It's two and a half months. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1185.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1187.3s)]
*  One month you miss your period. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1187.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1189.1s)]
*  Maybe you're going to Vegas. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1189.5s)]
*  You're having some fun. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1190.9s)]
*  Maybe you didn't have a lot of carbs. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1191.6s)]
*  Something's going on. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1193.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1194.0s)]
*  Two months you don't get a period, you're going to start wondering. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1194.9s)]
*  Two months, one week, you should be like, all right, pregnancy test. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1199.2s)]
*  Now you got seven days. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1202.4s)]
*  That's all. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1203.8s)]
*  That's all. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1204.4s)]
*  I think we might need a little longer. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1206.0s)]
*  I think. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1207.5s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1208.5s)]
*  We might need a little longer. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1210.5s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1212.5s)]
*  Because the first month is a mulligan. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1213.3s)]
*  You know what that is? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1217.2s)]
*  If you haven't had your period in six weeks, I do know that. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1217.9s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1219.7s)]
*  If you haven't had your period in six weeks, you're not going to be like, hey, I might be pregnant. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1220.9s)]
*  No girl's going to be like, I should take a test. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1223.9s)]
*  No, because they didn't eat that week. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1225.6000000000001s)]
*  Sometimes their periods don't come. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1228.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1229.8s)]
*  Sometimes, dead ass, their periods don't come. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1230.4s)]
*  But they could take a pregnancy test anyway. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1232.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1233.6s)]
*  But they wouldn't do it. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1233.8999999999999s)]
*  Why would they? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1234.8s)]
*  Because they missed their period. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1235.6s)]
*  Because it's a tenement abortion ban. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1236.3999999999999s)]
*  Son, that's important. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1237.8s)]
*  But you don't take pregnancy tests for the same reason we don't take an STD test. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1239.5s)]
*  You don't want to find out? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1243.3999999999999s)]
*  Too busy having fun? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1247.3999999999999s)]
*  This herpy is forming. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1248.3s)]
*  I'm telling you, test or not. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1249.3999999999999s)]
*  But think about it, for that two months, they're too busy having fun because you don't have any period during that time where she's a little, you know. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1251.5s)]
*  She outside. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1256.8999999999999s)]
*  But she's been nutted in. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1258.1s)]
*  All happy. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1258.8999999999999s)]
*  She's been nutted in multiple times. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1259.6999999999998s)]
*  She don't even know she's been nutted in. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1261.0s)]
*  She was partying. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1262.2s)]
*  She didn't know. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1263.4s)]
*  It was like, oh, they was fucking, like, whatever. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1264.4s)]
*  It's fuck. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1266.4s)]
*  Freak off. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1267.1s)]
*  It's fuck time. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1267.8s)]
*  It's a freak off. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1268.6s)]
*  It's a ditty party. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1269.2s)]
*  You're just getting thrown around. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1270.1s)]
*  How many weeks do you think they need? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1271.4s)]
*  Say again? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1272.6s)]
*  How many weeks do you think they need? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1273.1s)]
*  Let's talk it out because now we know 70 is really too little. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1275.2s)]
*  It's too little. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1278.8s)]
*  Based on the psychology of a whore. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1279.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1281.6s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1282.2s)]
*  You're getting thrown around like a trout at a fish market in Seattle. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1282.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1286.2s)]
*  You don't know who's nutted in you or who isn't, right? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1286.8s)]
*  You come 70 days. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1289.8s)]
*  70 days later, you're like, I should get a pregnancy test. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1291.3999999999999s)]
*  Or 60 days later. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1293.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1294.3999999999999s)]
*  60 days plus 7. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1294.8s)]
*  67 days later, you get, I should take a pregnancy test. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1296.1s)]
*  You take a pregnancy test. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1298.8s)]
*  Oh shit, you pregnant. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1299.6999999999998s)]
*  Damn. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1301.1999999999998s)]
*  And we got through. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1302.1999999999998s)]
*  You don't know if the guy who nutted in you was rich or not. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1303.0s)]
*  You got to figure that out. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1305.5s)]
*  You got to look into it. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1306.3999999999999s)]
*  You can't figure that out in three days. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1307.1s)]
*  What if he's in a draft class and you don't know if he's about to go to the league? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1308.8s)]
*  You're going to abort a future NBA prospect? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1311.3s)]
*  But the draft is in three months. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1315.1999999999998s)]
*  You got to wait. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1317.3999999999999s)]
*  So now, based on this logic, you got to go to the combine. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1318.8s)]
*  You got to see the vertical. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1323.6s)]
*  You got to see the 40. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1324.6s)]
*  You got to see what type of draft prospect this guy is. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1325.7s)]
*  If he could go first round, lottery pick? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1328.3999999999999s)]
*  Yep. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1332.0s)]
*  Keeping it. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1332.6s)]
*  Let it grow. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1333.1s)]
*  Let it grow. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1335.1s)]
*  Let it grow. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1336.8s)]
*  I'm telling you. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1339.0s)]
*  But you might need three more months. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1339.8s)]
*  So now we're at eight months. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1340.8999999999999s)]

*  We are at 10 weeks. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1347.6s)]
*  OK. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1350.6s)]
*  We know that you're not really checking to see if you're pregnant or not until how many weeks? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1352.5s)]
*  Six to seven. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1356.8s)]

*  OK. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1359.7s)]
*  How many days you need to decide if the guy who nutted in you is going to be rich or is rich? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1361.3999999999999s)]
*  It depends. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1366.1s)]
*  I would say if we're just going to be fair and let's err on the side of comfort here, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1367.1s)]
*  three weeks. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1373.2s)]
*  That puts us at how many weeks? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1375.7s)]
*  88 days. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1379.3s)]
*  Depends on the time of year too. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1380.3s)]
*  Which is my point. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1381.6000000000001s)]
*  Which is about 12 and a half weeks. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1382.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1384.1000000000001s)]
*  We got to see a tax return before. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1385.5s)]
*  Taxes are very important. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1387.2s)]
*  Taxes are stressful time. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1388.7s)]
*  We can push it back a period even more. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1389.7s)]
*  I'm thinking three months is safe. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1391.5s)]
*  I'm thinking three months is safe. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1396.9s)]
*  Twelve weeks or three months? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1399.3s)]
*  Those can be different. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1400.3s)]
*  You know what? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1401.3s)]
*  You're fucking right. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1402.3s)]
*  That's an actually really important thing that I learned after having a kid. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1403.3s)]
*  The reason they say the week shit is because three months is not the same as 12 weeks. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1407.2s)]
*  You're 100% right. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1413.7s)]
*  Give them the months. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1415.7s)]
*  Three months. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1416.7s)]
*  No, we'll do weeks. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1417.7s)]
*  Weeks, weeks, weeks. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1418.7s)]
*  Could be a short month. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1419.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1421.7s)]
*  It's a 12 week abortion man. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1422.7s)]
*  Twelve weeks. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1424.7s)]
*  Now here's the thing. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1425.7s)]
*  You're going to want an extra week. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1426.7s)]
*  Because everyone procrastinates. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1432.2s)]

*  You got to find your right clinic. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1436.7s)]
*  You got to get the guy to pay for it. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1438.2s)]
*  Which vac are you going to use? [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1440.2s)]
*  Now we're at 12. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1443.2s)]
*  You might want to have a little fun. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1444.7s)]
*  I can't get pregnant again. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1446.7s)]
*  You might as well get pregnant again. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1448.7s)]
*  13 week abortion man? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1450.7s)]

*  If you're at 13, bad luck. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1454.7s)]
*  So 14 week abortion man. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1456.7s)]
*  I think 14 is a good number. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1458.7s)]
*  14 week abortion man. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1462.7s)]
*  They might have thrown all this through and 15 might have been the... [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1464.7s)]

*  15 weeks? [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1488.7s)]
*  When they made that rule about abortion in 1864. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1490.7s)]
*  There wasn't shit to do but get pregnant. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1494.7s)]
*  That's true. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1496.7s)]
*  You were acutely aware of what your period was. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1498.7s)]

*  They're playing chess. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1545.7s)]

*  Are you saying they're trying to use these NBA players and get pregnant with them? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1557.7s)]
*  That's what you're trying to accuse women of doing? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1559.7s)]
*  I don't think guys are doing it. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1561.7s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1563.7s)]
*  I don't think guys are fucking NBA players trying to get pregnant. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1565.7s)]
*  In my experience. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1567.7s)]
*  It's almost primarily women. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1569.7s)]
*  Listen. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1571.7s)]

*  I don't want to throw a wrench into this plan that we've devised here. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1575.7s)]
*  But I will throw one more suggestion. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1577.7s)]
*  The amount of time that you have [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1579.7s)]
*  The amount of time that you have [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1581.7s)]
*  is dependent on [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1583.7s)]
*  the [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1585.7s)]
*  financial situation you're in. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1587.7s)]
*  financial situation you're in. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1589.7s)]
*  So if you make [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1591.7s)]
*  So if you make [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1593.7s)]
*  over a quarter million dollars a year, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1595.7s)]
*  over a quarter million dollars a year, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1597.7s)]
*  you have eight months to decide. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1599.7s)]
*  you have eight months to decide. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1601.7s)]
*  I thought you were going the other way. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1603.7s)]
*  So 32 week abortion man. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1605.7s)]
*  So 32 week abortion man. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1607.7s)]
*  I mean 32 weeks is good. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1609.7s)]
*  If you're a woman, you're making a quarter million dollars, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1611.7s)]
*  you can support the baby on your own, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1613.7s)]
*  it's not a big deal. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1615.7s)]
*  You are not dependent on anybody else. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1617.7s)]
*  The only person's life's change is yours. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1619.7s)]
*  You should be entitled up to nine months, to be honest. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1621.7s)]
*  So 36 weeks. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1623.7s)]
*  36 week abortion man. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1625.7s)]
*  Fetal, dusted. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1627.7s)]
*  You got no job, you a stripper, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1629.7s)]
*  you get paid all cash. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1631.7s)]
*  It is if your job is all cash. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1633.7s)]
*  If you get paid tips, if you got to iron your money. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1635.7s)]
*  If you got to iron your money. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1637.7s)]
*  If you got to use an iron for your money. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1639.7s)]
*  This is a different, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1641.7s)]
*  I think it might be a shorter period. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1643.7s)]
*  I think it might be a shorter period. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1645.7s)]
*  And I think that I meant to reverse what I just said. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1647.7s)]
*  And I think that I meant to reverse what I just said. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1649.7s)]
*  I thought it was the other way around. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1651.7s)]
*  I think we solved it everybody. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1655.7s)]
*  We did. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1657.7s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1659.7s)]
*  There's also late delivery though. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1661.7s)]
*  I think we should have a 40 week abortion. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1663.7s)]
*  10 months. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1665.7s)]
*  That's a good point. What if the baby's late? [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1667.7s)]
*  So we got to build a pad sometime. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1669.7s)]
*  40 weeks. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1671.7s)]
*  40 week abortion man, done and dusted. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1673.7s)]
*  How far off do you think we are from [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1675.7s)]
*  yeah, we're killing something. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1677.7s)]
*  We don't know if it's a full human yet, but we're killing something. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1679.7s)]
*  We don't know if it's a full human yet, but we're killing something. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1681.7s)]
*  But we're okay with that. How far off do you think Americans are from that? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1683.7s)]
*  Yeah, I just feel like there's like a [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1685.7s)]
*  what is the term? Cognitive dissonance or whatever? [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1687.7s)]
*  When it's got a heartbeat, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1689.7s)]
*  it's not alive. It's not a life. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1691.7s)]
*  You guys are all convinced. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1693.7s)]
*  I just feel like we'd be gaslighting these Christians, man. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1695.7s)]
*  These Christians are like, yo there's a heartbeat! [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1697.7s)]
*  And then we're like, man shut up! Gay? [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1699.7s)]
*  You don't like gays! Shut up! [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1701.7s)]
*  Why y'all hate gays so much? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1703.7s)]
*  Why don't you watch a priest? [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1705.7s)]
*  Why don't you watch a priest? [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1707.7s)]
*  They say shit that is true [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1709.7s)]
*  and it's so obvious and we just call them homophobic. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1711.7s)]
*  And then if you [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1713.7s)]
*  acknowledge it's murder, it's like, yo it's got a heartbeat. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1715.7s)]
*  So what do you say to that? [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1717.7s)]
*  They have nothing. There's no [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1719.7s)]
*  I've never heard a response to it. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1721.7s)]
*  I'm saying we gotta stop gaslighting Christians, but we also just have to [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1723.7s)]
*  accept how we kind of feel. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1725.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1727.7s)]
*  That's like Louis' biz. It's killing a baby. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1729.7s)]
*  Women should be allowed to kill babies. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1731.7s)]
*  It's like women should be allowed to kill [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1733.7s)]
*  what's inside of them. But it is killing. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1735.7s)]
*  Up to a certain point, I don't think [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1737.7s)]
*  and I think that they should only be allowed to kill [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1739.7s)]
*  a certain amount of them. That's another thing. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1741.7s)]
*  Oh no, this, this is fire! [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1743.7s)]
*  This is fire! [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1745.7s)]
*  Let me ask you something now. If you found out a girl had [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1747.7s)]
*  24 abortions [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1749.7s)]
*  God damn. You gotta take away that [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1751.7s)]
*  right, right? There is a number. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1753.7s)]
*  There is a number! [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1755.7s)]
*  That's a kink at that point. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1757.7s)]
*  You're into it, bro! [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1759.7s)]
*  You're really into it. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1761.7s)]
*  God damn, that's a serial killer. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1763.7s)]
*  Baker's dozen. 13. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1765.7s)]
*  So you see the trans woman that was trying to get a uterus put in [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1767.7s)]
*  to be the first trans woman to have an abortion. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1769.7s)]
*  Oh my god! [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1771.7s)]
*  They trying to be hated, bro. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1773.7s)]
*  They trying to be hated. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1775.7s)]
*  Why is that bad? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1777.7s)]
*  This bitch doing too much. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1779.7s)]
*  I mean it is a lot, right? [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1781.7s)]
*  It's just too much. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1783.7s)]
*  If you're gonna go, go! [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1785.7s)]
*  Pro-choice and pro-abortion are different things. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1787.7s)]
*  This bitch is pro-abortion. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1789.7s)]
*  Alex has proved that you don't have to be a woman [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1791.7s)]
*  to have an abortion. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1793.7s)]
*  That trans dude could have a million abortions right now. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1795.7s)]
*  Why the hell does he need to be inside him? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1799.7s)]
*  Trans rights, bro. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1803.7s)]
*  Alba will get them pregnant. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1805.7s)]
*  Imagine getting a uterus put in, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1807.7s)]
*  getting pregnant to just have an abortion. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1811.7s)]
*  What a fuck? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1813.7s)]
*  What doctor is doing that? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1815.7s)]
*  What are you even connected to? I don't even know if the power outlets work. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1817.7s)]
*  It's like the UCB, what is it called? [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1819.7s)]
*  The USBC? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1821.7s)]
*  What is it connecting to? [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1823.7s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1825.7s)]
*  I don't know what you wired it up. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1827.7s)]
*  For real, is that even a real thing that they can do? [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1829.7s)]
*  They can put a uterus inside there? [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1831.7s)]
*  I think so. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1833.7s)]
*  Can you put a uterus on a dolphin? [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1835.7s)]
*  No, let me look. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1837.7s)]
*  We're using pig kidneys now, so it's like we can do a lot. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1839.7s)]
*  But what's a kidney do? [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1841.7s)]
*  You gotta hook it up though. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1843.7s)]
*  We got a place for a kidney. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1845.7s)]
*  So we just take it out. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1847.7s)]
*  New Delhi based surgeon would soon attempt a uterine transplant on a transgender woman. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1849.7s)]
*  It hasn't been performed successfully yet, but for people assigned male at birth. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1853.7s)]
*  Man, this guy just wants to kill a trans. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1857.7s)]
*  That is funny. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1863.7s)]
*  That is funny. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1865.7s)]
*  I was going to be honest about what that was. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1867.7s)]
*  I can put a uterus in you. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1869.7s)]
*  Experimental surgery. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1871.7s)]
*  So it looks like they're trying it, and trying to make it work. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1873.7s)]
*  Life tour this weekend. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1875.7s)]

*  I've never had the singular goal dream that I've had in mind since I started comedy. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1903.7s)]
*  So I am incredibly excited to say the least about those shows. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=1909.7s)]

*  okay, now it's a felony [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2169.7s)]
*  and once it's a felony, now we can [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2171.7s)]
*  put five years in prison or whatever the fuck it is. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2173.7s)]

*  there's another one where [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2185.7s)]
*  if you [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2187.7s)]

*  tax authorities [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2191.7s)]
*  is obviously a crime, right? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2193.7s)]
*  So if you're evading tax authorities. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2195.7s)]
*  So if you're falsifying records, that is a crime [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2197.7s)]
*  and doing that to evade [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2199.7s)]
*  tax authorities, that is [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2201.7s)]
*  a felony. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2203.7s)]
*  Now, anytime you would falsify records [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2205.7s)]
*  it would be to evade tax authorities [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2207.7s)]
*  so it's already going to be a felony [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2209.7s)]
*  so the DA hasn't even said which one it's going to be [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2211.7s)]
*  he's like, we got something that's a felony [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2213.7s)]
*  I don't got to tell you, but we got something [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2215.7s)]
*  it's [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2217.7s)]
*  it's an illegal short [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2219.7s)]
*  it's going to make me vote for him [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2221.7s)]
*  that's my take on it [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2223.7s)]

*  there's at least a little bit of a witch hunt [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2231.7s)]
*  a little bit of a witch hunt [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2233.7s)]

*  How are we supposed to pay him? [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2247.7s)]

*  He doesn't like to use his own money for anything [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2261.7s)]
*  But here's my thing, didn't he use his own money [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2263.7s)]

*  Sure, sure, but what I'm saying is, can't he say [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2269.7s)]

*  I keep saying it, I keep getting distracted [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2881.7s)]
*  You might have HD bro [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2883.7s)]
*  I might have the hood [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2885.7s)]
*  I might have it dude [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2887.7s)]
*  We need those people [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2889.7s)]
*  You would have been a doctor right now [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2891.7s)]
*  So here's the thing, I've taken Adderall [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2893.7s)]
*  Love it, it's great [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2895.7s)]
*  It still just makes me want to party [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2897.7s)]
*  Like people are like, I want to do homework [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2899.7s)]
*  And I'm like, have you partied on it? [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2901.7s)]
*  Because when I take it, I'm like, we need to party [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2903.7s)]
*  We need to go to a blonde's show [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2905.7s)]
*  And I need to hear some techno [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2907.7s)]
*  Because like nursing school, I used to take it [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2909.7s)]
*  Sunday morning [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2911.7s)]
*  Lock in, I'll be in the library [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2913.7s)]
*  Dark room, all black [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2915.7s)]
*  Like a private room situation, lock in for 8 hours [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2917.7s)]
*  Really? That's the only way I was doing it [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2919.7s)]
*  And you enjoyed what you were consuming? [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2921.7s)]
*  Like you had a thirst for the knowledge? [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2923.7s)]
*  I just needed to, but that was the only way I [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2925.7s)]
*  Taught myself because in class [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2927.7s)]
*  It was just like, I'm not paying attention [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2929.7s)]
*  So it's like that [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2931.7s)]
*  The day before, the Sunday before, each test [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2933.7s)]
*  That's when I learned everything [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2935.7s)]
*  And it worked? Every test was like between [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2937.7s)]
*  88 and 90 [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2939.7s)]
*  So then let's do it, let's do one day a week [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2941.7s)]
*  News gets one day a week [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2943.7s)]
*  And then we get on the Adderall [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2945.7s)]
*  And then we do one day a week [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2947.7s)]
*  And then we have six other days to do, you know, whatever we want [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2949.7s)]
*  It's too much to understand each story [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2951.7s)]
*  No, no, I'm telling you [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2957.7s)]
*  This is why there's no news organization [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2959.7s)]
*  This is why there's no news organization [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2961.7s)]
*  There's not one news organization out there that tells you [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2963.7s)]
*  The truth. Everyone is filtered through an opinion [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2965.7s)]
*  CNN is this, Fox is that [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2969.7s)]
*  Daily Wire is this [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2971.7s)]
*  The Atlantic is that [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2973.7s)]
*  The Guardian, everybody has their filter [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2975.7s)]
*  The New York Times, they have their filter [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2977.7s)]
*  And you have to [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2979.7s)]
*  Because to do the research [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2981.7s)]
*  To tell people the truth every day [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2983.7s)]
*  On a topic [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2985.7s)]
*  Impossible [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2987.7s)]
*  It's not [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2989.7s)]
*  Humanly possible [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2991.7s)]
*  Bro, experts every week [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2993.7s)]
*  Go on Rogan [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2995.7s)]
*  Every week they go on Rogan [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2997.7s)]
*  Experts that have dedicated their lives [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=2999.7s)]
*  And the same week another expert is like [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3001.7s)]
*  That's bullshit [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3003.7s)]
*  I feel the exact opposite [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3005.7s)]
*  Of everything you just said [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3007.7s)]
*  He's a World War II expert [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3009.7s)]
*  There's another World War II expert from the other side [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3011.7s)]
*  That believes in 100% [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3013.7s)]
*  Certainty he is right [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3015.7s)]
*  Rat beef [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3019.7s)]
*  Listen to it [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3021.7s)]
*  Maybe we just need to tend to our gardens [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3023.7s)]
*  What does that mean? Just take care of your house [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3025.7s)]
*  Just tend to your garden bro [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3027.7s)]
*  That's easy to say when you grew up with a garden [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3029.7s)]
*  We have an apartment where there's a Dominican [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3031.7s)]
*  That's fucking banging pots and pans all fucking night long [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3033.7s)]
*  Ten to your stoop [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3035.7s)]
*  That is why Dominicans go outside [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3037.7s)]
*  Dude, a pigeon clapping outside [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3039.7s)]
*  Yes, let's play with pigeons [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3041.7s)]
*  You have to distract yourself [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3043.7s)]

*  This is incredibly important [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3113.7s)]
*  Let's face it, after a night out with drinks [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3115.7s)]
*  We don't bounce back [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3117.7s)]
*  The next day like we used to [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3119.7s)]
*  Especially at my age, I'm 40 years old [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3121.7s)]
*  Even a night of responsible drinking [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3123.7s)]
*  After shows can potentially ruin the next day [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3125.7s)]
*  I miss out on the next day, I'm recovering [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3127.7s)]
*  I can't work out, I can't play paddle [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3129.7s)]
*  I can't do some writing [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3131.7s)]
*  It's not good, but luckily [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3133.7s)]

*  Zbiotics is a probiotic drink [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3157.7s)]

*  I've been actually following Rick Ross [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3215.7s)]
*  He's really good at beef [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3217.7s)]
*  Yeah, he's really [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3219.7s)]
*  I'm impressed [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3221.7s)]
*  Like I didn't even listen to the song [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3223.7s)]
*  I tried to listen to it [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3225.7s)]
*  It kinda sucked or it was good [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3227.7s)]
*  I didn't even know [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3229.7s)]
*  But he is on that ass [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3231.7s)]
*  Non-stop, incessantly [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3233.7s)]
*  And it's like [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3235.7s)]
*  He's almost M&M'd it [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3237.7s)]
*  Where you can't say anything about [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3239.7s)]
*  Calling him fat, he's like I know I'm fat [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3241.7s)]
*  I have my shirt off all the time [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3243.7s)]
*  He's saying, pears [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3245.7s)]
*  He's made fun of his diet [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3247.7s)]
*  He's made fun of everything about him [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3249.7s)]
*  But he's really good at like [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3251.7s)]
*  Creating like monikers and names [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3253.7s)]
*  Like he's fucking efficient [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3255.7s)]
*  At beef and the beef [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3257.7s)]
*  Ain't even with him [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3259.7s)]
*  Did Drake mention him [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3261.7s)]
*  That much? Drake did mention him [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3263.7s)]
*  Not much but it was just they have [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3265.7s)]
*  An issue with women [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3267.7s)]
*  Like I think there's a lot of pillow talking [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3269.7s)]
*  That's been going on and that's [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3271.7s)]
*  What does pillow talking mean? [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3273.7s)]
*  Like if two guys slept with the same girl [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3275.7s)]
*  And now this girl goes and tells the other guy [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3277.7s)]
*  Stuff that you guys spoke about [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3279.7s)]
*  I don't know if this is on Patreon but do you remember when we had this conversation [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3281.7s)]
*  When I was like, yo the same thousand girls [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3283.7s)]
*  Are getting fucked by everybody [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3285.7s)]
*  Was it on a public episode? [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3287.7s)]
*  That is the cause of all this beef [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3289.7s)]
*  So thank them bitches, subscribe [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3291.7s)]
*  Subscribe to OnlyFans, all the joy you're getting [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3293.7s)]
*  Is from these OnlyFans bitches [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3295.7s)]
*  That every dude is fucking and they're all [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3297.7s)]
*  Upset about it [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3299.7s)]
*  Of the ego, thank god [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3301.7s)]
*  Okay so there's pillow talk going on [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3303.7s)]
*  So there's one of Rick Ross's exes [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3305.7s)]
*  Imagine Rick Ross laying on your girl [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3307.7s)]
*  See how warm when you get there [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3309.7s)]
*  She's in a slanket [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3315.7s)]
*  What was that thing that you could walk around in all day [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3317.7s)]
*  There's a slanket also [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3319.7s)]
*  Okay, okay [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3321.7s)]
*  But like a few months back Rick Ross is one of his exes [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3323.7s)]
*  And she was just going crazy [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3325.7s)]
*  Online like trying to air him out [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3327.7s)]
*  Just because they had a bad break up [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3329.7s)]
*  And she was saying that, oh Ross doesn't even like Drake [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3331.7s)]
*  He talks shit about him [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3333.7s)]
*  And we thought she was just bullshitting [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3335.7s)]
*  But it turns out that was all true [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3337.7s)]
*  Because you can tell Ross has been waiting for this [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3339.7s)]
*  He's been wanting to go out [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3341.7s)]
*  He is hungry, he's nonstop [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3343.7s)]
*  What did you say? [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3345.7s)]
*  He's always hungry [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3347.7s)]
*  But he's not, it's like every single post on Instagram [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3349.7s)]
*  And then Drake got a kind of response to it [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3351.7s)]
*  Because Ross isn't a peon [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3353.7s)]
*  Ross is one of the biggest names in music [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3355.7s)]
*  And somehow he beat [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3357.7s)]
*  The CEO [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3359.7s)]
*  Charges [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3361.7s)]
*  Like he took a play out of 50's book [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3363.7s)]
*  Because both of them, when they're beefing [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3365.7s)]
*  They're relentless [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3367.7s)]
*  That's what I was going to say, it's reminiscent of 50's [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3369.7s)]
*  Where just every social media post [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3371.7s)]
*  Is so funny, cuts through it [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3373.7s)]
*  But what makes him good? What do you feel like he's doing that's like a fact? [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3375.7s)]
*  He is having fun [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3377.7s)]
*  He is smiling [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3379.7s)]
*  He's so silly, he's a cartoon [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3381.7s)]
*  He should be like a villain in the Incredibles [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3383.7s)]
*  You know what I mean? He's just out there [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3385.7s)]
*  And he has these beautiful fucking veneers [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3387.7s)]
*  And every post he's smiling [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3389.7s)]
*  And you can't not look at him, he's got face tattoos [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3391.7s)]
*  His chest is out, he's silly no matter what he does [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3393.7s)]
*  He's performing at a prom [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3395.7s)]
*  Most people would be embarrassed [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3397.7s)]
*  To do that during a beef [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3399.7s)]
*  He wears a Drake shirt and leans in [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3401.7s)]
*  Like it's a plywood floor [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3403.7s)]
*  Drake tries to take a shot [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3405.7s)]
*  And it doesn't, he has like an invincibility to him [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3407.7s)]
*  Because he doesn't care [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3409.7s)]
*  I'm not affected by any of it [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3411.7s)]
*  Once when Drake dropped the disc [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3413.7s)]
*  He's just laughing on IG stories [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3415.7s)]
*  He's laughing in the studio [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3417.7s)]
*  And then two hours later [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3419.7s)]
*  And nobody cares about the song [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3421.7s)]
*  He didn't even need to put out a song [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3423.7s)]
*  The stuff that stuck was at the end of the song [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3425.7s)]
*  When he was just talking [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3427.7s)]
*  The song didn't have shots really [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3429.7s)]
*  I just remember now when he's going [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3431.7s)]
*  He just keeps calling him white boy [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3433.7s)]
*  That shit is hilarious [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3435.7s)]
*  It's funny [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3437.7s)]
*  It's this simplicity, you think of BBL Drake [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3439.7s)]
*  He's got a fake nose [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3441.7s)]
*  His nose looks the same [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3443.7s)]
*  I don't think he got a fake nose [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3445.7s)]
*  But saying it is hysterical [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3447.7s)]
*  And now I'm questioning [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3449.7s)]
*  Now you're like, did he get a fake nose? [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3451.7s)]
*  Now I'm like, can I? [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3453.7s)]
*  Where do you get these fake noses at? [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3455.7s)]
*  How do you take off this amount of time for recovery? [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3457.7s)]
*  I mean [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3459.7s)]
*  He got fake abs, that's why you're wearing that shit on tour [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3461.7s)]
*  He's making fun of Drake's body [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3463.7s)]
*  Which is hysterical [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3465.7s)]
*  The idea that he would talk about physique [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3467.7s)]
*  And you're like, I'm 35% body fat [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3469.7s)]
*  But you still got sculpted abs [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3471.7s)]
*  BBL Drake is crazy [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3473.7s)]
*  Unbelievable [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3475.7s)]
*  So he's fantastic at making these monogamy [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3477.7s)]
*  And now he's almost [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3479.7s)]
*  He's got this gravitational pull [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3481.7s)]
*  And now the beef seems less with Kendrick [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3483.7s)]
*  Even though that's what we want [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3485.7s)]
*  We want the bars for Kendrick [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3487.7s)]
*  The Kendrick bars feels like it's going to bail out Drake [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3489.7s)]
*  From this Rick Ross smoke [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3491.7s)]
*  Possibly [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3493.7s)]
*  I don't think Kendrick can do this [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3495.7s)]
*  He's not really Instagram taunting [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3497.7s)]
*  The way Rick Ross can [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3499.7s)]
*  I think Kendrick is like [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3501.7s)]
*  He's got his easel [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3503.7s)]
*  And he's got his oil paints [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3505.7s)]
*  And he's trying to make his beautiful painting [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3507.7s)]
*  He's trying to Bob Ross it [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3509.7s)]
*  But the Rick Ross, that's profits [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3511.7s)]
*  You don't want to wake up on Instagram to mention every thing [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3513.7s)]
*  He's Gallagher and Drake is a watermelon [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3515.7s)]
*  Relentless [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3517.7s)]
*  Every show, bang bang [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3519.7s)]
*  And he actually caused Drake's probably only misstep of the weekend [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3521.7s)]
*  Because he puts out a screenshot [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3523.7s)]
*  Of the text that he sends his mom [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3525.7s)]
*  Because his mom was like, oh I'm here and you got a no job [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3527.7s)]
*  I think it was a doctor text, I don't think it's actually his mom [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3529.7s)]
*  Yo mom, text me this [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3531.7s)]
*  And I'm going to respond [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3533.7s)]
*  Even so, it was so corny [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3535.7s)]
*  And then he's like, oh mom he's racist [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3537.7s)]
*  And he's on some [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3539.7s)]
*  Monjaro [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3541.7s)]
*  Grumpy and shit [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3543.7s)]
*  But I'm like, you trying to play the race card, you're half white, half black [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3545.7s)]
*  And you're calling this guy racist [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3547.7s)]
*  And you're saying it to your mom, it was just such the corniest play [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3549.7s)]
*  But the distract [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3551.7s)]
*  Towards everybody, I give him that [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3553.7s)]
*  That was good [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3555.7s)]
*  The Drake distract went crazy [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3557.7s)]
*  I didn't catch it at first [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3559.7s)]
*  My first listen, I didn't know what he was saying [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3561.7s)]
*  I thought it was all going to be about Kendrick [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3563.7s)]
*  And I didn't realize, he got to go out to everybody [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3565.7s)]
*  So I was like disappointed, I was like, I thought it would be more bars for Kendrick [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3567.7s)]
*  You're calling him short, I get called short all the time, it's not that bad [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3569.7s)]
*  But then when I caught all the shit he was saying [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3573.7s)]
*  I was like, oh yeah, you went, you went, he went [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3575.7s)]
*  Yo, that shit was flames [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3577.7s)]
*  The Metro one is the best diss to me [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3579.7s)]
*  That's some Rick Ross type shit [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3581.7s)]
*  Shut up and make your drums [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3583.7s)]
*  Why are you involved in this? [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3585.7s)]
*  For Metro to respond, he's got to do exactly what Drake said [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3587.7s)]
*  That's so annoying [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3591.7s)]
*  It was all some Rick Ross shit [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3593.7s)]
*  It's not go make a beat, it's just make drums [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3595.7s)]
*  So dismissive [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3599.7s)]
*  I was offended for him [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3601.7s)]
*  That was a hard slot [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3603.7s)]
*  But the bars were crazy, I mean there was a lot of [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3605.7s)]
*  Double entendres, triple entendres [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3607.7s)]
*  Once the internet started explaining [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3609.7s)]
*  I was like, oh this is fire [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3611.7s)]
*  The drop it, give it 50 shit is great [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3613.7s)]
*  I knew what that was coming from immediately [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3615.7s)]
*  But then to find out it had to do with the record deal [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3617.7s)]
*  Yeah, the TDE thing [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3619.7s)]
*  So he's, to get out of his deal [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3621.7s)]
*  I believe he had to either sell [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3623.7s)]
*  He is Kendrick [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3625.7s)]
*  So it's like Top Dog, the guy who he used to be signed to [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3627.7s)]
*  That's TD Entertainment, Top Dog Entertainment [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3629.7s)]
*  To get out of it, he had to [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3631.7s)]
*  I believe either sell 50% of his catalog [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3633.7s)]
*  Or give him like 50% [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3635.7s)]
*  Of future earning [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3637.7s)]
*  Something, it's like [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3639.7s)]
*  That's why Drake wants him to release the contract [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3641.7s)]
*  Because there's a big [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3643.7s)]
*  Rumor that he's [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3645.7s)]
*  O's top like 50% [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3647.7s)]
*  Didn't they have him in a 360 before that basically? [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3649.7s)]
*  Yeah, but everybody's in it [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3651.7s)]
*  I think when you start out [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3653.7s)]
*  You get in a 360 and you're just so hungry for the opportunity [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3655.7s)]
*  You'll take whatever deal is there [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3657.7s)]
*  Because you think a deal is going to make your career [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3659.7s)]
*  It's kind of like to what Russ was saying [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3661.7s)]
*  And then when you start making money, you learn a little bit more about the industry [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3663.7s)]
*  You learn a little bit more how it works [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3665.7s)]
*  You're like, okay, how can I kind of buy my freedom [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3667.7s)]
*  But you locked up in these deals [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3669.7s)]
*  And the way that it works is like [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3671.7s)]
*  It's not for you to be free [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3673.7s)]
*  We're signing 20 people [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3675.7s)]
*  And one of them might pop and you got to pay for all 20 [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3677.7s)]
*  Here's my one [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3679.7s)]
*  Pushback with that part [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3681.7s)]
*  Isn't that what everybody says happened to Drake? [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3683.7s)]
*  That's what push keeps saying [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3685.7s)]
*  The M's count different when baby divides the pie [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3687.7s)]
*  You signed one N-word, you signed another N-word, you signed three N-words [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3689.7s)]
*  So that's kind of the same [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3691.7s)]
*  I'm like, how much of your money are you keeping in music? [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3693.7s)]
*  Apparently Drake was keeping none [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3695.7s)]
*  That was the case [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3697.7s)]
*  But now Drake's out of his deal [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3699.7s)]
*  And I think that's the argument with the Kendrick situation [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3701.7s)]
*  Is that he might have had to give up half [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3703.7s)]
*  To get out [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3705.7s)]
*  Maybe, I don't know [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3707.7s)]
*  The Swifties line [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3709.7s)]
*  Make a song with Taylor Swift because you have to for the money [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3711.7s)]
*  Drop and give me 50 [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3713.7s)]
*  That's what his label's saying [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3715.7s)]
*  Drop an album and give me 50 [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3717.7s)]
*  It's just like really close [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3719.7s)]
*  The second part that I don't hear people talking about [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3721.7s)]
*  That it's probably the most disrespectful [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3723.7s)]
*  This is where I'm glad you're talking about this [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3725.7s)]
*  This is wild [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3727.7s)]
*  So when he says he calls out Kendrick's [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3729.7s)]
*  Wife with him [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3731.7s)]
*  And he's like, oh [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3733.7s)]
*  And it was like a play on Tondra with [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3735.7s)]
*  Whitney Houston and [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3737.7s)]
*  Bodyguard song [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3739.7s)]
*  But people used to refer to [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3741.7s)]
*  J-fuck [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3743.7s)]
*  J-rock [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3745.7s)]
*  As Kendrick's bodyguard, his muscle [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3747.7s)]
*  And there was a rumor that Whitney slept with J-rock [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3749.7s)]
*  Whitney meaning Kendrick's wife [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3751.7s)]
*  Yes [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3753.7s)]
*  Oh that's diabolical [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3755.7s)]
*  So that line [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3757.7s)]
*  If one of is true, even if it's not true [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3759.7s)]
*  That's crazy [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3761.7s)]
*  And can we also say one thing [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3763.7s)]
*  The whole reason he went on the shop and was like [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3765.7s)]
*  I didn't respond to Push because I didn't want to be so filthy [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3767.7s)]
*  He did the J-Cole [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3769.7s)]
*  I sleep better, I didn't have to do that [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3771.7s)]
*  We gotta look at that differently now [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3773.7s)]
*  Well he has responded to Push though [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3775.7s)]
*  No, he said he wrote a song after Push did [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3777.7s)]
*  But since then he's responded to Push [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3779.7s)]
*  But he said I had a song [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3781.7s)]
*  We know what he said, what I'm saying is since then he has had plenty of bars for Push [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3783.7s)]
*  But that's different [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3785.7s)]
*  Not like in the heat of the battle [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3787.7s)]
*  And it's like he said he didn't want to go that personal [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3789.7s)]
*  And now you went now [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3791.7s)]
*  So he was like I could have been filthy [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3793.7s)]
*  But I don't want to have to do that [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3795.7s)]
*  Yeah, say the real thing which is like you're just [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3797.7s)]
*  Inflating this guy that you're so far beyond [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3799.7s)]
*  When you do with Push, but with Kendrick it's [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3801.7s)]
*  Worked it [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3803.7s)]
*  With Push it's like [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3805.7s)]
*  With all due respect where the fuck is Push now [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3807.7s)]
*  It's over [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3809.7s)]
*  So it's like Drake is on top of the world again [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3811.7s)]
*  After taking the L in there will beef [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3813.7s)]
*  If he just kept beefing with this guy [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3815.7s)]
*  You're just going to keep putting air in his lungs [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3817.7s)]
*  Whereas not talking about him [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3819.7s)]
*  Is going to silence him [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3821.7s)]
*  Also I think Push is legit sociopathic [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3823.7s)]
*  Like Push is like I'll go [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3825.7s)]
*  I don't give a fuck [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3827.7s)]
*  100% is great [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3829.7s)]
*  So knowing that he's going to go wherever [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3831.7s)]
*  The only thing that keeps the air in his [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3833.7s)]
*  Sails is you [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3835.7s)]
*  Make the boat stall [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3837.7s)]
*  Exactly [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3839.7s)]
*  You could take the risk with Kendrick [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3841.7s)]
*  Kendrick it makes sense [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3843.7s)]
*  Because by beating him now you're undisputed [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3845.7s)]
*  Number one nobody could be like [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3847.7s)]
*  Hey Kendrick is actually better he's more of an artist [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3849.7s)]
*  Drake is McDonald's Kendrick [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3851.7s)]
*  Is Carbone whatever [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3853.7s)]
*  But nobody ever compared Drake [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3855.7s)]
*  To Pusha no one will ever [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3857.7s)]
*  Compare Drake to Pusha [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3859.7s)]
*  I have some white shit to do [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3861.7s)]
*  You hate Drake so much [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3863.7s)]
*  Y'all gassed it [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3865.7s)]
*  Who's your favorite rapper [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3867.7s)]
*  No embrace it Drake [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3869.7s)]
*  You are white [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3871.7s)]
*  What's wrong with being white [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3873.7s)]
*  Why is that an insult [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3875.7s)]
*  I sleep better [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3877.7s)]
*  You lost that's fine just acknowledge you lost [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3879.7s)]
*  That's cool [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3881.7s)]
*  This you are clearly winning right now [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3883.7s)]
*  I also as much as I'll hate on Drake [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3885.7s)]
*  I will admit it and be like yo he's probably going to go down [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3887.7s)]
*  As the greatest ever he's not necessarily for me [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3889.7s)]
*  Probably going to go down as the greatest ever [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3891.7s)]
*  And I think he's going to win this battle [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3893.7s)]
*  So I give credit [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3895.7s)]
*  So tell us some more shit [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3897.7s)]
*  We partially ruined this beef because on the Patreon episode [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3899.7s)]
*  When we show the public [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3901.7s)]
*  About this AI music stuff [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3903.7s)]
*  Now everybody thinks everything's AI [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3905.7s)]
*  So there was a track [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3907.7s)]
*  So there was multiple versions of the Drake song [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3909.7s)]
*  That came out I think what happened [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3911.7s)]
*  Is so he just laid down [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3913.7s)]
*  His lyrics [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3915.7s)]
*  And then sent it around to a couple of producers [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3917.7s)]
*  To try to put a beat over it [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3919.7s)]
*  That's what I think because there's a version out now [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3921.7s)]
*  That it's just his vocals with no music on it [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3923.7s)]
*  So the fact that somebody can get a hold of that [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3925.7s)]
*  Most likely he sent that out to a few people [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3927.7s)]
*  And so the first version that came out [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3929.7s)]
*  Or the first version that I got [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3931.7s)]
*  Where it was like it was a biggie sample [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3933.7s)]
*  On it get money [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3935.7s)]
*  And I actually like that version the best [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3937.7s)]
*  Even though he's not really rhyming on the beat too well [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3939.7s)]
*  That's why people thought it was AI [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3941.7s)]
*  Because he's not really hitting the beat [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3943.7s)]
*  The way that he would hit the beat [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3945.7s)]
*  It wasn't a mixed finished song [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3947.7s)]
*  It was a leak [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3949.7s)]
*  And so then I feel that he was rushed [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3951.7s)]
*  To put that second version out [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3953.7s)]
*  Because the first thing didn't sound too great [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3955.7s)]
*  I don't think he really wanted to drop [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3957.7s)]
*  The way that it was released [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3959.7s)]
*  Okay so rushed to put out the second thing [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3961.7s)]
*  Meaning [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3963.7s)]
*  So now the second version of that [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3965.7s)]
*  Distract [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3967.7s)]
*  I still don't think he wanted to [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3969.7s)]
*  He wants Kendrick to drop first [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3971.7s)]
*  He wants Kendrick to drop I'm ready [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3973.7s)]
*  He posted that shit posted his manager [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3975.7s)]
*  So it's like this is the thing [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3977.7s)]
*  The leak got out so now it's forced his hand [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3979.7s)]
*  He had to put this out [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3981.7s)]
*  Now there's a Kendrick leak [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3983.7s)]
*  That came out yesterday [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3985.7s)]
*  Is it real or AI? [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3987.7s)]
*  From the internet most people are saying it's AI [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3989.7s)]
*  I haven't heard AI that good [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3991.7s)]
*  To sound like the person do different inflections [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3993.7s)]
*  And tone [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3995.7s)]
*  The bars are kind of dope [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3997.7s)]
*  That's the thing that's interesting about this [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=3999.7s)]
*  You could [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4001.7s)]
*  If it flops you say nah that's AI [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4003.7s)]
*  If it's fire you go that was us [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4005.7s)]
*  Or if it flops you apologize [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4007.7s)]
*  And take it off your album [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4009.7s)]
*  Bro J. Cole might win in all this bro [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4011.7s)]
*  Everyone's gonna go at each other [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4013.7s)]
*  Everyone's shit is gonna get leaked [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4015.7s)]
*  Everyone's gonna be like oh this person had a ghostwriter for this [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4017.7s)]
*  And then J. Cole's gonna be the only person sitting there unscathed [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4019.7s)]
*  Yo that's true [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4021.7s)]
*  I think Drake posted [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4023.7s)]
*  That there was a reference track that came out for one of Kendrick's songs [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4025.7s)]
*  And did that guy get exposed as a fraud? [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4027.7s)]
*  That's debatable [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4029.7s)]
*  So what was that story? [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4031.7s)]
*  So that [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4033.7s)]
*  I forgot the name of the rapper [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4035.7s)]
*  And he only [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4037.7s)]
*  He only used like maybe two or three bars [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4039.7s)]
*  From that reference track [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4041.7s)]
*  Most of the time like a reference track [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4043.7s)]
*  If they use the entire song [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4045.7s)]
*  Then it's like oh that's ghostwriting [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4047.7s)]
*  But if somebody sends a reference track like hey [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4049.7s)]
*  Here's an idea of how you can flow on the beat [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4051.7s)]
*  And here's what I would say on the song [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4053.7s)]
*  And if you take a little thing here and there [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4055.7s)]
*  And you give them a writing credit on it [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4057.7s)]
*  Usually that's fine [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4059.7s)]
*  But that guy wasn't credited on that song [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4061.7s)]
*  And he did use like maybe one or two lines from it [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4063.7s)]
*  Interesting [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4067.7s)]
*  So technically [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4069.7s)]
*  And then rap over it like after the song came out [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4071.7s)]
*  To make it look like it was a reference track [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4073.7s)]
*  That's what I thought [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4075.7s)]
*  They could make it look like you have a writer [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4077.7s)]
*  By basically after you put out your song [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4079.7s)]
*  Rewrapping including some bars [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4081.7s)]
*  And then putting it out going oh this is the reference track [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4083.7s)]
*  Same with the Yachty Drake reference track [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4085.7s)]
*  Wait what was that one? [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4087.7s)]
*  So there was a reference track for Jumbotron [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4089.7s)]
*  Oh is that why Rick Ross is like [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4091.7s)]
*  Yachty's the pen [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4093.7s)]
*  So they're saying that Yachty basically put down all the bars for that track [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4095.7s)]
*  And then that reference track came out [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4097.7s)]
*  But then some people were like wait is this AI of Yachty doing the song? [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4099.7s)]
*  And so it's like no one knows [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4101.7s)]
*  Because you can find any cartoon character doing a rap of any song [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4103.7s)]
*  Hold on [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4105.7s)]
*  Does AI make this beef better then? [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4107.7s)]
*  No [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4109.7s)]
*  No because [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4111.7s)]
*  The fact that there's so much mystery [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4113.7s)]
*  That everything is shrouded in [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4115.7s)]
*  Creates more conversation [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4117.7s)]
*  And that's what we really want out of this [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4119.7s)]
*  We don't want definitive answers [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4121.7s)]
*  We want to debate, we want to go back and forth [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4123.7s)]
*  We want to say this person but no this bar is actually this [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4125.7s)]
*  Hey this guy's going to come back [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4127.7s)]
*  Oh what we heard is there's a track out there that's so crazy [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4129.7s)]
*  We want all the conversation [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4131.7s)]
*  Because it fills up our day [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4133.7s)]
*  If it's just headshot done [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4135.7s)]
*  We're bored again [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4137.7s)]
*  True but at the same time it takes like [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4139.7s)]
*  It takes the win out of the sales if you're debating if the song is real [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4141.7s)]
*  Yeah I agree [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4143.7s)]
*  But it does force artists to perform [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4145.7s)]
*  So like now instead of dropping a diss track [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4147.7s)]
*  You're going to have to drop a diss music video [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4149.7s)]
*  Where you have to be like yo I'm actually just going to [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4151.7s)]
*  Wrap it on camera so people know this is from me [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4153.7s)]
*  And this is what I'm saying [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4155.7s)]
*  Or you just drop it on your social page [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4157.7s)]
*  Yeah and you can promote it [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4159.7s)]
*  I'm going live [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4161.7s)]
*  Yeah and that's the weird part about this so Drake has never officially said [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4163.7s)]
*  That song is me [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4165.7s)]
*  Because when they say that [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4167.7s)]
*  Because when that first came out people were saying it's AI [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4169.7s)]
*  He hasn't [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4171.7s)]
*  He's like been DMing people saying like [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4173.7s)]
*  What's up where's Kendrick at [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4175.7s)]
*  But he hasn't officially said [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4177.7s)]
*  Hey I'm putting this song out it's not on any streaming service [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4179.7s)]
*  And so I'm like [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4181.7s)]
*  Is it AI? [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4183.7s)]
*  And people because [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4185.7s)]
*  It's getting good reception he's not [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4187.7s)]
*  Denying it [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4189.7s)]
*  Yo here's the question I got [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4191.7s)]
*  That would be crazy AI to have all those [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4193.7s)]
*  To your point about Kendrick [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4195.7s)]
*  I just no I can't see AI going triple [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4197.7s)]
*  On tonder with shit [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4199.7s)]
*  And inside info that's actually [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4201.7s)]
*  And apparently [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4203.7s)]
*  It doesn't have to be AI in that way like it could be someone [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4205.7s)]
*  Else wrote it and then they use [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4207.7s)]
*  Well Maul also I think before the song came out [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4209.7s)]
*  Said drop and give me 50 on the pot by the way Maul is being so [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4211.7s)]
*  Funny I was listening to him talking about J Cole [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4213.7s)]
*  Unbelievable shouts to Maul and Rory but anyway [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4215.7s)]
*  He said drop and give me 50 before [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4217.7s)]
*  This song oh yeah they [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4219.7s)]
*  Heard something yeah so he heard something and it must have been [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4221.7s)]
*  I don't believe this is AI [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4223.7s)]
*  And this is coming from the only guy who will [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4225.7s)]
*  Say anything negative about Drake [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4227.7s)]
*  Or maybe they made the AI track [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4229.7s)]
*  You gotta catch up [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4231.7s)]
*  You gotta catch up bro [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4233.7s)]
*  Shit [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4235.7s)]
*  How do I get featured in one of these diss tracks? [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4237.7s)]
*  I'm trying to get sampled. Do you have any advice on how to [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4239.7s)]
*  Cause I'm actually I really want to get [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4241.7s)]
*  Sampled in one of these. Oh yeah that was five [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4243.7s)]
*  Tracks in one of these. Oh that was sick [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4245.7s)]
*  That was sick [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4247.7s)]
*  I want to get sampled bro. That was five [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4249.7s)]
*  Drake is the greatest rapper ever [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4251.7s)]
*  Sample that [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4253.7s)]
*  Metro Boomin is the greatest producer ever [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4255.7s)]
*  Boom add that if you want to [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4257.7s)]
*  Rick Ross is the greatest rapper ever [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4259.7s)]
*  So if any of these guys want to use that in a diss track [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4261.7s)]
*  Just go ahead put it in there [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4263.7s)]
*  Well Charlamagne just had a lot of reasoning behind what he said [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4265.7s)]
*  You just echoed the last [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4267.7s)]
*  Word of your sentence. I agree [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4269.7s)]
*  That's what he done put [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4271.7s)]
*  That works [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4273.7s)]
*  That's fire [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4275.7s)]
*  Nah I killed that [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4277.7s)]
*  Strong agreement dude [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4279.7s)]
*  Strong agreement. That was nice [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4281.7s)]
*  That was really good. Bro my [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4283.7s)]
*  Phones started blowing up that shit [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4285.7s)]
*  I was like I thought I was on album [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4287.7s)]
*  So you almost were you didn't agree [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4291.7s)]
*  If you agreed [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4293.7s)]
*  If you agreed you would have been on that album [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4295.7s)]
*  Later today we do brilliant ish [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4297.7s)]
*  Just make sound. It's gonna be black church bro [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4301.7s)]
*  Bro. Keep going talk about it [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4303.7s)]
*  That shit was so fire. Charlamagne had this great [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4305.7s)]
*  Monologue but it was just totally overshadowed by [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4307.7s)]
*  My agreeance [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4309.7s)]
*  That's what everybody was saying on the internet [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4311.7s)]
*  That's really what everybody was saying on the internet [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4313.7s)]
*  Charlamagne had all these really interesting thoughtful points [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4315.7s)]
*  But when you just went I agree [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4317.7s)]
*  And then I agree [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4319.7s)]
*  The second inflection on the [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4321.7s)]
*  I agree. Oh my god [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4323.7s)]
*  That can't be AI [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4325.7s)]
*  They said I don't know if this is true but the rumor [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4327.7s)]
*  Is that Metro isolated my vocals [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4329.7s)]
*  And then really increased the inflection on the [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4331.7s)]
*  I agree. That's what [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4333.7s)]
*  You good. You get it [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4335.7s)]

*  Situation. You were kind of doing a kid cutty impression [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4361.7s)]
*  What was I doing? You were humming a little bit [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4363.7s)]

*  If that Kendrick track is not AI [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4373.7s)]
*  He's not built for this. If that's him [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4375.7s)]
*  If your wife gets called out in the song [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4377.7s)]
*  And then your response is that [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4379.7s)]
*  It's over. Oh that's what I was gonna say [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4381.7s)]
*  Drake had so many fucking bars [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4383.7s)]
*  And it was so well done [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4385.7s)]

*  Like where they write up the obituary of the person before they die [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4397.7s)]
*  And then when they die they just release the thing first [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4399.7s)]
*  I didn't know that they do that [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4401.7s)]
*  I didn't know that [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4403.7s)]
*  They'll write like the obituary [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4405.7s)]
*  Like this person died, they had a great life, this is who they are [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4407.7s)]
*  And they have it for all the celebrities [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4409.7s)]
*  And then once they die they're able to just be like [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4411.7s)]
*  This date boom be the first one to release [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4413.7s)]
*  But do they update it? [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4415.7s)]
*  Well they'll just be like their life everything that they've done up until that point [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4417.7s)]
*  Yeah but sometimes later in life Harvey Weinstein [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4419.7s)]
*  gets called out for some shit [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4421.7s)]
*  And it changes the fucking obituary [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4423.7s)]

*  Or you're just knocking the person to release [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4429.7s)]
*  I think once you make it to TMZ they start the obituary with that fact [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4431.7s)]
*  And then they just keep going until [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4433.7s)]

*  Clitorectomy, clitorectomy, it's close enough [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4503.7s)]
*  It can't be a hysterectomy [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4505.7s)]
*  That's removed uterus [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4507.7s)]

*  So they got the bars ready so when the [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4527.7s)]
*  That's what I'm wondering, it was just so many [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4529.7s)]
*  It was like so many good lines, there was so many things put together [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4531.7s)]
*  Like he's been off tour for about [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4533.7s)]
*  Three weeks so [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4535.7s)]
*  And they've been building toward this [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4537.7s)]
*  How long do you think it takes to write a song? [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4539.7s)]
*  Well we thought it was like 20 seconds [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4541.7s)]
*  With AI [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4543.7s)]
*  That's true [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4545.7s)]
*  Yeah I don't know, I thought it takes a while [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4547.7s)]
*  To like really perfect it and make it [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4549.7s)]
*  Good [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4551.7s)]
*  For Kendrick at least, they've been building [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4553.7s)]
*  I'm sure, they've had, because they've been building for this beat for a decade [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4555.7s)]
*  So you think they are keeping shit? [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4557.7s)]
*  I would assume, I would assume [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4559.7s)]
*  I think they have stuff that they plan to say [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4561.7s)]
*  In the tuck ready to go [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4563.7s)]
*  Because they're saying this Kendrick [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4565.7s)]
*  Four year old track [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4567.7s)]
*  And it's like I don't think he'll release [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4569.7s)]
*  That track but he'll take lines from it [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4571.7s)]
*  Because it has to sound dated at this point [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4573.7s)]
*  Right, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4575.7s)]
*  Wild [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4577.7s)]
*  But if this Kendrick track isn't real [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4579.7s)]
*  And he still hasn't dropped [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4581.7s)]
*  He's looking funny in the light right now [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4583.7s)]
*  Because he won at this battle [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4585.7s)]
*  Drake replied [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4587.7s)]
*  He should have dropped immediately right after [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4589.7s)]
*  Yeah why do you think he's not? [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4591.7s)]
*  I don't know [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4593.7s)]
*  He wanted it, that's what's weird [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4595.7s)]
*  He wanted it, from 10 years ago [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4597.7s)]
*  He wanted it [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4599.7s)]
*  So that's where I'm like, what's going on [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4601.7s)]
*  Maybe he had to retool after [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4603.7s)]
*  Maybe the Whitney line made him be like [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4605.7s)]
*  Fuck I gotta go, now we gotta go harder [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4607.7s)]
*  Like we gotta take it there now [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4609.7s)]
*  And maybe he had that for later [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4611.7s)]
*  And now he's adjust, I don't know [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4613.7s)]
*  But everyday that goes by [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4615.7s)]
*  He's looking weaker and weaker [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4617.7s)]
*  I don't know if they got anything on Drake [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4619.7s)]
*  But the only thing Rick Ross says is that his nose is fake [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4621.7s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like if that's the only thing [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4623.7s)]
*  You're saying I'm like alright that's probably it [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4625.7s)]
*  Nah something's going on because the way that all these [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4627.7s)]
*  People turned on Drake, he did something [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4629.7s)]
*  Like he's [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4631.7s)]
*  Fucked enough girls and pillow talk probably enough [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4633.7s)]
*  Where it's like they got a lot of shit on him [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4635.7s)]
*  Or a reason to not like him [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=4637.7s)]

*  Over the weekend that's all the news said they're basically like [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5057.7s)]
*  Look Iran fired a bunch of drones ballistic [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5059.7s)]
*  Missiles cruise missiles into [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5061.7s)]
*  Into Israel okay that was the headline World War [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5063.7s)]
*  3 is going crazy first time that these [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5065.7s)]
*  Two nations despite proxy wars intention [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5067.7s)]
*  That they've actually been [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5069.7s)]
*  Direct attack ever in [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5071.7s)]
*  History wow okay that's like a big deal [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5073.7s)]
*  So in other words Israel's never [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5075.7s)]
*  Directly attacked Iran [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5077.7s)]
*  Iran's never directly attacked Israel [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5079.7s)]
*  They've both attacked their positions [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5081.7s)]
*  In other countries i.e. Syria [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5083.7s)]
*  So Iran maybe blew up some Israeli [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5085.7s)]
*  Sites in Syria Israel blew up I think the [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5087.7s)]
*  Embassy or something there okay got it [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5089.7s)]
*  Got it got it so that's the headline is like [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5091.7s)]
*  Boom World War 3 is happening this is [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5093.7s)]
*  And why is this World War 3? Because these two [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5095.7s)]
*  Nations one they're both [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5097.7s)]
*  Sovereign both they have a lot of [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5099.7s)]
*  Military power obviously Israel has [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5101.7s)]
*  All of America they got [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5103.7s)]
*  Nuclear weapons Iran is working [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5105.7s)]
*  On a nuclear program some people believe they have nuclear weapons [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5107.7s)]
*  Some people believe they can contract nuclear weapons [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5109.7s)]
*  Through North Korea so [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5111.7s)]
*  It's like potentially two [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5113.7s)]
*  Nuclear powers going potentially [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5115.7s)]
*  Nuclear powers going at it in like a hot war [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5117.7s)]
*  Right and they all have allies they're supposed to [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5119.7s)]
*  Step in right the boys are going [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5121.7s)]
*  To war then you got to be there for the boys [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5123.7s)]
*  Right that's the idea okay so [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5125.7s)]
*  Why is this happening the real answer [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5127.7s)]
*  Goes back for a thousand years [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5129.7s)]
*  Yeah [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5131.7s)]
*  But like the close answer for why it's [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5133.7s)]
*  Happening right now is that on April [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5135.7s)]
*  1st Israel attacked [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5137.7s)]
*  An embassy in Damascus in Syria [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5139.7s)]
*  Yeah an Iranian embassy [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5141.7s)]
*  Got it so it depends on how [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5143.7s)]
*  You look at it right so and all [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5145.7s)]
*  The looks so it's like depending [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5147.7s)]
*  On the perspective you want to take which again this is [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5149.7s)]
*  Who do we take who do you want to go first [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5151.7s)]
*  Okay okay I guess you could [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5153.7s)]
*  Take you could take Iran's [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5155.7s)]
*  Perspective yeah let's go Iran's first Iran's [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5157.7s)]
*  Perspective end with the good guys [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5159.7s)]
*  What what [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5161.7s)]
*  There's an embassy in Syria [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5163.7s)]
*  All right embassies typically under international [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5165.7s)]
*  Law are like sovereign soil like [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5167.7s)]
*  These are our nations and [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5169.7s)]
*  If you attack an embassy it's like attacking [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5171.7s)]
*  The country and there's like different [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5173.7s)]
*  Kind of rules on this embassies have been attacked in the [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5175.7s)]
*  Past our embassy got attacked our embassy got attacked [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5177.7s)]
*  Shala Hillary Clinton handled that beautifully [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5179.7s)]
*  Exactly like Israel's [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5181.7s)]
*  Embassy in Argentina got attacked in the 90s [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5183.7s)]
*  From Iran like a bunch of people it's like [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5185.7s)]
*  This has happened before and it hasn't really been considered [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5187.7s)]
*  War but under international law it is [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5189.7s)]
*  So if you attack an embassy it's not a good [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5191.7s)]
*  Look so basically Iran's like [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5193.7s)]
*  Yo you just attacked our embassy what the fuck we have to [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5195.7s)]
*  Retaliate and why'd they attack it [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5197.7s)]
*  So Israel's perspective [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5199.7s)]
*  Is that they basically got intelligence that there's [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5201.7s)]
*  Seven high ranking IRGC [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5203.7s)]
*  Like basically Iranian government officials [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5205.7s)]
*  In one building now the building [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5207.7s)]
*  Is technically the consulate next to [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5209.7s)]
*  The embassy whoa [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5211.7s)]
*  So it's like an annex [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5213.7s)]
*  That's rented by the [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5215.7s)]
*  The embassy yeah by the embassy [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5217.7s)]
*  So it's not so technically they're like it's not technically [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5219.7s)]
*  The embassy it's not [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5221.7s)]
*  Technically the embassy you're renting [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5223.7s)]
*  It if you check the [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5225.7s)]
*  It's not war look at the [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5227.7s)]
*  Tell them but technically look at it [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5229.7s)]
*  Yeah so basically [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5231.7s)]
*  They attacked the building right next to the embassy [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5233.7s)]
*  Shouldn't have been in the consulate [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5235.7s)]
*  Should have stayed in the embassy [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5237.7s)]
*  If I were you they kill [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5239.7s)]
*  Seven high ranking Iranian officials [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5241.7s)]
*  Two civilian casualties technically [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5243.7s)]
*  I was like read [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5245.7s)]
*  Devious reports on that like goes either way but [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5247.7s)]
*  I think two civilians [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5249.7s)]
*  One of the Iranian officials that died was like [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5251.7s)]
*  A high ranking dude that allegedly [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5253.7s)]
*  From Israeli intelligence was an architect [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5255.7s)]
*  Of the October 7th attacks [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5257.7s)]
*  My understanding is that maybe [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5259.7s)]
*  A couple of them were also working [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5261.7s)]
*  With the [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5263.7s)]
*  Go yeah so a bunch of them were basically [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5265.7s)]
*  Alleged to be like arms [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5267.7s)]
*  Dealers and like for [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5269.7s)]
*  Hezbollah yeah and like basically supply [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5271.7s)]
*  Chain operatives for [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5273.7s)]
*  Hezbollah and Hamas [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5275.7s)]
*  And Hezbollah the issue is obviously [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5277.7s)]
*  The concern is up north in Lebanon [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5279.7s)]
*  Where their positions so if the rockets are getting [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5281.7s)]
*  Fired from their drones or anything is getting fired from [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5283.7s)]
*  Up north of Israel they're like okay [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5285.7s)]
*  If we can cut that off I don't know [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5287.7s)]
*  If that does end up cutting it off [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5289.7s)]
*  I think you can just slide another person into that [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5291.7s)]
*  Position but that's how valuable [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5293.7s)]
*  These people are according to obviously [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5295.7s)]
*  Israel's actions it seems like they saw these targets [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5297.7s)]
*  Were high value and hard to replace right [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5299.7s)]
*  And they're all in the same place at one time so [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5301.7s)]
*  They're trying to launch like a surgical attack to neutralize [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5303.7s)]
*  These seven high value targets to try to [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5305.7s)]
*  Stop money and weapons [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5307.7s)]
*  Flowing into flowing into Hezbollah [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5309.7s)]
*  In Lebanon and also getting [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5311.7s)]
*  Retaliation for what some [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5313.7s)]
*  People believe was an architect for October 7th [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5315.7s)]
*  So that's why Israel did it [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5317.7s)]
*  Okay [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5319.7s)]
*  So now Iran's like okay you just attacked our embassy [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5321.7s)]
*  We can't look pussy and [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5323.7s)]
*  Be like alright you just killed our guys [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5325.7s)]
*  So now Iran's in a tricky position right [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5327.7s)]
*  They get attacked and they're like [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5329.7s)]
*  Okay if we launch a full fledged [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5331.7s)]
*  War with Israel [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5333.7s)]
*  America comes in [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5335.7s)]
*  America's getting involved [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5337.7s)]
*  This is a huge problem but if we do nothing [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5339.7s)]
*  Then everybody thinks we pussy [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5341.7s)]
*  Exactly [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5343.7s)]
*  Because we got these huge oil reserves [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5345.7s)]
*  And if they start thinking we're pussy [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5347.7s)]
*  We're not going to defend ourselves [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5349.7s)]
*  Then all of a sudden these oil reserves aren't going to be Iranian anymore [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5351.7s)]
*  They're going to be whoever really wants it [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5353.7s)]
*  So they all link up Ayatollah's in there [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5355.7s)]
*  They're all talking do we do a diss track [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5357.7s)]
*  What do we move right [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5359.7s)]
*  So they basically are like alright we're going to launch [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5361.7s)]
*  A bunch of drones [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5363.7s)]
*  We're going to launch the easiest things to get shot down ever [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5365.7s)]
*  And we're going to do a press conference 72 hours before [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5367.7s)]
*  So we're going to do this press conference and we're going to be like [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5369.7s)]
*  Hey and again even this [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5371.7s)]
*  Is disputed whether you're on like the left or right [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5373.7s)]
*  Within Iran and Israel [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5375.7s)]
*  So like people on the right in Israel [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5377.7s)]
*  Would be like no this was an aggravated attack [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5379.7s)]
*  They were trying to kill civilians and they're declaring [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5381.7s)]
*  War a direct war not a proxy war [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5383.7s)]
*  On Israel [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5385.7s)]
*  And they're saying like if you look at the types of missiles that were used [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5387.7s)]
*  There's cruise missiles there were ballistic missiles [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5389.7s)]
*  These are like fast like [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5391.7s)]
*  These are hard to intercept [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5393.7s)]
*  These are trying to kill people [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5395.7s)]
*  If you look at kind of like the left side they'd be like [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5397.7s)]
*  Look they're not really trying to kill people [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5399.7s)]
*  They're letting you know [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5401.7s)]
*  It's also launching from Iran [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5403.7s)]
*  So it takes time to get there [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5405.7s)]
*  Remember Iran's not next door [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5407.7s)]
*  It's got to fly over Jordan [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5409.7s)]
*  It's got to go a long way [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5411.7s)]
*  So they basically hold a press conference [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5413.7s)]
*  They're like hey we're launching these things [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5415.7s)]
*  Some people think they tipped off [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5417.7s)]
*  The Americans like hey these drones are coming just so you know [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5419.7s)]
*  They launch all of them [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5421.7s)]
*  And they don't overwhelm one specific area [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5423.7s)]
*  They kind of launch it in like a disparate kind of attack [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5425.7s)]
*  So it's easier to neutralize [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5427.7s)]
*  Some people are saying if they're trying to like hit something specific [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5429.7s)]
*  They would overwhelm one specific area [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5431.7s)]
*  That the Iron Dome couldn't try to neutralize [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5433.7s)]
*  And the way the Iron Dome essentially functions [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5435.7s)]
*  Is it sends its own missile up [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5437.7s)]
*  And hits the target in the air [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5439.7s)]
*  So if you launch it all in one specific area [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5441.7s)]
*  Maybe those different [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5443.7s)]
*  You can overwhelm us [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5445.7s)]
*  So that something would go through [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5447.7s)]
*  Again this is a potential take [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5449.7s)]
*  Obviously if you're there in Israel you're seeing these missiles launch [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5451.7s)]
*  It looks pretty fucking hot, it looks pretty real to you [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5453.7s)]
*  Looks like something's going to land [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5455.7s)]
*  So 99% of the missiles were intercepted [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5457.7s)]
*  Missiles and drones [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5459.7s)]
*  I'm using that word interchangeably [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5461.7s)]
*  99% were intercepted, some did land [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5463.7s)]
*  And one, there were no casualties [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5465.7s)]
*  One young girl was injured [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5467.7s)]
*  But I think she's in a stable condition [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5469.7s)]
*  I think there was some damage to a military base [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5471.7s)]
*  Military base, like an air base in one of the deserts [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5473.7s)]
*  I've heard the name of it was also damaged [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5475.7s)]
*  But no casualties [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5477.7s)]
*  And then Iran it seems like [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5479.7s)]
*  Based off their press release which came out on Twitter [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5481.7s)]
*  Which is just so funny to me [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5483.7s)]
*  They did all caps like America stay out of it [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5485.7s)]
*  Who's in control [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5487.7s)]
*  Is my dad on Twitter [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5489.7s)]
*  The one tweeting this [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5491.7s)]
*  But basically they're saying we're completely happy [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5493.7s)]
*  With this attack, like this is exactly what we wanted [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5495.7s)]
*  This is concluded [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5497.7s)]
*  We're moving on [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5499.7s)]
*  Everyone shut up [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5501.7s)]
*  It seems like they were happy [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5503.7s)]
*  With 99% interception and then no one got injured [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5505.7s)]
*  Which indicates to me that Iran [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5507.7s)]
*  Didn't really want to hit a bunch of targets [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5509.7s)]
*  They're trying to puff their chest, they're trying to save faces [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5511.7s)]
*  We can't look pussy [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5513.7s)]
*  100% [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5515.7s)]
*  Nobody died so you got no reason to come back to us [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5517.7s)]
*  We look like we got our get back [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5519.7s)]
*  You don't really need a get back [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5521.7s)]
*  We made [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5523.7s)]
*  You spend a lot of money [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5525.7s)]
*  I think there's another component to this which is the financial side [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5527.7s)]
*  So they shot [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5529.7s)]
*  And now they're saying no beef [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5531.7s)]
*  They're saying hey we got our get back [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5533.7s)]
*  You killed our guys and you attacked our embassy [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5535.7s)]
*  They really joked [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5537.7s)]
*  They were just like look we're even [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5539.7s)]
*  It's a watch [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5541.7s)]
*  Yeah they did Jay Cole it [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5543.7s)]
*  But they didn't go we're sorry for doing that [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5545.7s)]
*  Jay Cole was like I should have never done this, it's not my character [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5547.7s)]
*  They were like we got you back [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5549.7s)]
*  And didn't they shoot at the building [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5551.7s)]
*  With the red heifer building [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5553.7s)]
*  There were missiles intercepted over it [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5555.7s)]
*  But it doesn't look like they were directly targeting it [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5557.7s)]
*  But I don't know exactly what the targets were [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5559.7s)]
*  Because they too believe in the Dome of the Rock [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5561.7s)]
*  This is obviously a historic site for them [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5563.7s)]
*  But that's why I'm like why would they shoot [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5565.7s)]
*  It seems like they're like [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5567.7s)]
*  Hey we went back at you [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5569.7s)]
*  So it's like you know [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5571.7s)]
*  This wasn't [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5573.7s)]
*  And Aron it doesn't seem like once [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5575.7s)]
*  A direct [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5577.7s)]
*  What did you just say? [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5579.7s)]
*  If you don't see the wink [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5581.7s)]
*  Then you just don't understand [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5583.7s)]
*  I just heard the hot guys have a stroke [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5585.7s)]
*  I was like what the fuck is happening [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5587.7s)]
*  He said hey hey you we get back at you [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5589.7s)]
*  It doesn't seem like Aron wants a direct aggravated world war with Israel and America [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5591.7s)]
*  It seems like they want to retaliate as a show of force [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5601.7s)]
*  Their economy is not doing good [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5603.7s)]
*  And the Ayatollah doesn't have a ton of support from the public [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5605.7s)]
*  From the Iranian people [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5607.7s)]
*  So he's not in a position to be like [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5609.7s)]
*  Doing a ground invasion [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5611.7s)]
*  So now we're in a position where Israel [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5613.7s)]
*  And it seems like Netanyahu can actually use this as leverage [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5615.7s)]
*  Netanyahu is kind of like [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5617.7s)]
*  We don't hate this idea of some type of [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5619.7s)]
*  Direct conflict with Iran [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5621.7s)]
*  From the analysts that I've listened to [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5623.7s)]
*  Because he's now able to use this to deflect from what's happening in Gaza [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5625.7s)]
*  And the second biggest [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5629.7s)]
*  And maybe the biggest enemy to Israel that's not Hamas [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5631.7s)]
*  Is western media [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5633.7s)]
*  And the perception of the west [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5635.7s)]
*  So now he's able to be like [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5637.7s)]
*  Dude we're getting attacked from this major nation that has potentially nuclear warheads [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5639.7s)]
*  Like look at us [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5641.7s)]
*  We're fucking getting rinsed over here [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5643.7s)]
*  We gotta do something [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5645.7s)]
*  They can get more money, they can get more support from the west [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5647.7s)]
*  And now you have more politicians like [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5649.7s)]
*  We gotta back them up [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5651.7s)]
*  And the west has sympathy for Gaza [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5653.7s)]
*  It does not have sympathy for [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5655.7s)]
*  Iran [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5657.7s)]
*  It does not have sympathy for [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5659.7s)]
*  The leadership that constantly say death to America or death to the west [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5661.7s)]
*  So it is going to be very hard [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5663.7s)]
*  To justify supporting Iran [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5665.7s)]
*  Over Israel in this situation [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5667.7s)]
*  So even if there are people in America [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5669.7s)]
*  Who do not like Israel [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5671.7s)]
*  They dislike Iran more [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5673.7s)]
*  And your enemy of your enemy is your friend [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5675.7s)]
*  So it could be [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5677.7s)]
*  And then yahoo can potentially delay elections too [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5679.7s)]
*  So we can kind of preserve power a little bit [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5681.7s)]
*  That's what he needs to do [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5683.7s)]
*  Because I think October 6th, 7th [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5685.7s)]
*  He used as kind of like [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5687.7s)]
*  Hey this is good PR for us, we're going to run with this [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5689.7s)]
*  And then that kind of faded [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5691.7s)]
*  And then the west mainly [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5693.7s)]
*  Seems like they've switched and been like [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5695.7s)]
*  What the fuck are y'all doing [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5697.7s)]
*  And now that same thing could apply here [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5699.7s)]
*  But at a certain point people will start to be like [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5701.7s)]
*  Guys they sent that there, that was a bullshit attack [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5703.7s)]
*  You're just using, you know what I mean? [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5705.7s)]
*  Over time the PR war doesn't last [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5707.7s)]
*  This thing only lasts for a moment in time [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5709.7s)]
*  The sympathy you have [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5711.7s)]
*  But did Netanyahu say he's going to get his get back in a strong way? [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5713.7s)]
*  That's what he said [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5715.7s)]
*  He said we're going to retaliate [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5717.7s)]
*  And America basically said [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5719.7s)]
*  We're not going to participate in the retaliation [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5721.7s)]
*  So they were like [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5723.7s)]
*  It's up to you, whatever you're going to do [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5725.7s)]
*  But it seems like America is trying to tell them [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5727.7s)]
*  Yo chill [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5729.7s)]
*  And so it depends on if they want to escalate [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5731.7s)]
*  It seems like Iran [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5733.7s)]
*  It doesn't really matter if America participates in the retaliation [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5735.7s)]
*  It matters if America defends [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5737.7s)]
*  Israel from what Iran will do next [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5739.7s)]
*  Which they probably will [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5743.7s)]
*  Okay so then they have carte blanche to do whatever the fuck they want [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5745.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5747.7s)]
*  So it's like yeah go on [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5749.7s)]
*  Do your thing, do whatever you want [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5751.7s)]
*  As long as daddy is here to bail you out [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5753.7s)]
*  When shit hits the fucking fan [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5755.7s)]
*  But that's basically their bluff to say [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5757.7s)]
*  That America could defend us like they have [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5759.7s)]
*  So like even in this attack [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5761.7s)]
*  The money is interesting that you brought up [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5763.7s)]
*  So it seems like Iran shot [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5765.7s)]
*  I forget how many, a couple hundred drones, ballistic missiles [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5767.7s)]
*  Some people put the total of like 6 to 10 million dollars [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5769.7s)]
*  For that attack [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5771.7s)]
*  And then the missile defense [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5773.7s)]
*  From Iron Dome [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5775.7s)]
*  But the majority of the missiles it seems like from what I've read [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5777.7s)]
*  Were shot down from American fighter jets [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5779.7s)]
*  Yeah because the Houthis I think also launched them [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5781.7s)]
*  And I think Hezbollah also launched at the same time [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5783.7s)]
*  So it's American fighter jets [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5785.7s)]
*  And then there's I believe Jordanian [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5787.7s)]
*  Jordan and then some people will edge Saudi Arabia [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5789.7s)]
*  But it's not positive whether or not Saudi Arabia did [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5791.7s)]
*  I think Egypt too [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5793.7s)]
*  But there was other countries that were supportive of this [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5795.7s)]
*  And it makes sense if the missiles are flying over your country you won't want to take any risks [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5797.7s)]
*  They neutralize stuff in their airspace [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5799.7s)]
*  And it's also interesting for Iran [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5801.7s)]
*  To basically say oh which countries are [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5803.7s)]
*  Going to shoot down our ship [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5805.7s)]
*  So they get to kind of test like [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5807.7s)]
*  We're waging some type of hot war [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5809.7s)]
*  Which countries are letting it happen and which ones are going to shoot down our missiles [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5811.7s)]
*  And I don't know if they can get this data [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5813.7s)]
*  But it would be quite interesting that they're learning [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5815.7s)]
*  Where all the anti-missile [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5817.7s)]
*  Defense systems are [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5819.7s)]
*  So not just the Iron Dome [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5821.7s)]
*  They learned where [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5823.7s)]
*  Their missiles can get shot down [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5825.7s)]
*  From Egypt [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5827.7s)]
*  From Jordan [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5829.7s)]
*  From any other place in the pathway [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5831.7s)]
*  And I don't know if that data can [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5833.7s)]
*  If that data is present [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5835.7s)]
*  I don't know if there's some way where like the drones themselves [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5837.7s)]
*  Can see a missile coming from where it was shot [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5839.7s)]
*  But they would have the locations [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5841.7s)]
*  And I don't know if that changes routing [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5843.7s)]
*  But that could be valuable data for them for war in the future [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5845.7s)]
*  I'm sure they're pulling intelligence [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5847.7s)]
*  But it seems like the defense [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5849.7s)]
*  Again the attack was like 6 to 10 mil [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5851.7s)]
*  The defense [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5853.7s)]
*  Depending on which source [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5855.7s)]
*  Was like 1.6 billion [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5857.7s)]
*  Jesus Christ [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5859.7s)]
*  So it's super expensive [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5861.7s)]
*  So it's a money game and that's the thing about war [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5863.7s)]
*  War is a money game as well [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5865.7s)]
*  We think once we get into war that shit is just free [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5867.7s)]
*  But you need to pay for each bullet [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5869.7s)]
*  I think that was what happened with the war [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5871.7s)]
*  The proxy war in Afghanistan between the US [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5873.7s)]
*  And Russia [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5875.7s)]
*  Where basically we armed [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5877.7s)]
*  I think Afghani soldiers [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5879.7s)]
*  With these like anti helicopter missiles [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5881.7s)]
*  They were like that you could use from the ground [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5885.7s)]
*  You just throw it up on your shoulder [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5887.7s)]
*  So a helicopter cost [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5889.7s)]
*  Millions of dollars, one of these missiles cost thousands [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5891.7s)]
*  Eventually Russia is like this is too expensive [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5893.7s)]
*  We can't have our helicopters [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5895.7s)]
*  Shot down every single fucking time with these thousand dollar missiles [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5897.7s)]
*  So there is a version where [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5899.7s)]
*  It's a war of financial attrition [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5901.7s)]
*  But why such the big difference [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5903.7s)]
*  I also got the numbers as estimates [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5905.7s)]
*  It wasn't like officially released [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5907.7s)]
*  So there might not be [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5909.7s)]
*  Those exact numbers [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5911.7s)]
*  But it's a really really disparate amount [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5913.7s)]
*  I can also see blindly sending a weapon [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5915.7s)]
*  As opposed to [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5917.7s)]
*  Intercepting that weapon at an exact point in time [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5919.7s)]
*  And making sure they collide [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5921.7s)]
*  That just takes a lot more technology [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5923.7s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5925.7s)]
*  The cost of shooting a gun versus [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5927.7s)]
*  If you had a gun that you could shoot [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5929.7s)]
*  That then would hit the bullet of the gun coming at you [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5931.7s)]
*  Yeah but that [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5933.7s)]
*  System is already in place [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5935.7s)]
*  I'm sure it's money to keep [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5937.7s)]
*  Maintaining it but still it's like [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5939.7s)]
*  The cost really is just the [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5941.7s)]
*  Missile that went up to defend it [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5943.7s)]
*  Or to like shoot it down [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5945.7s)]
*  I understand what you're saying, it's the intelligence [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5947.7s)]
*  And the intelligence you pay for once [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5949.7s)]
*  And then you just have to put that intelligence into whatever missile it is [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5951.7s)]
*  I understand where he's coming from [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5953.7s)]
*  I assume right now that it is more expensive for some reason [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5955.7s)]
*  There is that financial [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5957.7s)]
*  Liability [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5959.7s)]
*  That Jordan, Israel, [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5961.7s)]
*  America, maybe Saudi, maybe Egypt [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5963.7s)]
*  Have to take on, and how much longer will they take on? [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5965.7s)]
*  That's the question [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5967.7s)]
*  Could it also be [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5969.7s)]
*  A shot to Israel like look, you're going to [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5971.7s)]
*  Shoot all these down, but it's going to be [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5973.7s)]
*  Expensive, if you're going to try to kill our people [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5975.7s)]
*  Just know that that shit is going to cost you [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5977.7s)]
*  Like Israel specifically [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5979.7s)]
*  Don't do this again because it's not worth it [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5981.7s)]
*  Financially for you to kill our people [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5983.7s)]
*  No, no, it's the other way expensive [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5985.7s)]
*  Israel had to pay 1.6 billion, right? [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5987.7s)]
*  Yes [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5989.7s)]
*  So, Yidan could be saying to Israel, look, don't [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5991.7s)]
*  If you kill our people, we're going to make you spend a lot of money [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5993.7s)]
*  We might not have a war with you, but you're going to spend [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5995.7s)]
*  A lot of fucking money and it won't be worth it [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5997.7s)]
*  I got to, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=5999.7s)]
*  There's a version of it, I mean you only have so much [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6001.7s)]
*  Money for a military budget [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6003.7s)]
*  So, yeah, I don't know [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6005.7s)]
*  So what do you think happens? So now we wait basically [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6007.7s)]
*  For Israel to retaliate [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6009.7s)]
*  I think they will, because it seems like the US is like [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6011.7s)]
*  Yo, chill the fuck out [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6013.7s)]
*  It depends when, so people are going to speculate with Passover [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6015.7s)]
*  Like would they try to instigate that and then potentially face [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6017.7s)]
*  Further escalation during Passover [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6019.7s)]
*  When is Passover? [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6021.7s)]
*  I think it starts like now [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6023.7s)]
*  Or like a week, or a couple days [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6025.7s)]
*  It's like about to happen [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6027.7s)]
*  22nd to April 30th [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6029.7s)]
*  Yeah, so like a week [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6031.7s)]
*  So basically it's like, and these things move kind of slow [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6033.7s)]
*  So like this thing happened the first and then the retaliation [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6035.7s)]
*  Was the 14th, so like there's a two week span [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6037.7s)]
*  So it's like they have time [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6039.7s)]
*  Whether or not they do it in the window, it might be like a month later [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6041.7s)]
*  So I think with [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6043.7s)]
*  Soleimani, when [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6045.7s)]
*  US neutralized him, the Iranian [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6047.7s)]
*  Leader, they retaliated like a month [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6049.7s)]
*  Later on like a base, which again [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6051.7s)]
*  Didn't, I don't think kill anyone, or like [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6053.7s)]
*  It just like hit the base, but they gave some warning [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6055.7s)]
*  Which again, it's just like a show of force [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6057.7s)]
*  Like hey, you attack our guy, we're coming back at you [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6059.7s)]
*  So, yeah [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6061.7s)]
*  It's just a matter of waiting, and then if they basically [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6063.7s)]
*  Try to climb the escalation ladder [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6065.7s)]
*  America might have to get involved [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6067.7s)]
*  There might be like a plea, it's so crazy listening to these [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6069.7s)]
*  Analysts, like they have like [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6071.7s)]
*  The people that are profiting directly [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6073.7s)]
*  From war on the TV channels [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6075.7s)]
*  And they're like, what do you think we should do about this [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6077.7s)]
*  And they're like, we need to nuke Iran [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6079.7s)]
*  What is going on [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6081.7s)]
*  This is crazy [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6083.7s)]
*  But like a lot of them are like, yeah, we need to [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6085.7s)]
*  Take out their nuclear program [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6087.7s)]
*  Every day that's happening, that we're not neutralizing nuclear power in Iran [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6089.7s)]
*  Like it's just waiting for a nuclear attack from them [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6091.7s)]
*  And it's like, and then people are claiming like [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6093.7s)]
*  Oh, we need to do this and we need this defense [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6095.7s)]
*  Because it's preventing a larger war [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6097.7s)]
*  Like imagine all these missiles all of a sudden hit [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6099.7s)]
*  Israel, is their retaliation like [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6101.7s)]
*  Five times more, is it way greater [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6103.7s)]
*  And now we're in a full on nuclear war [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6105.7s)]
*  So is America's protection preventing this [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6107.7s)]
*  Nuclear war [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6109.7s)]
*  It depends, these are the war games we play [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6111.7s)]
*  I'm not built for war bro [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6113.7s)]
*  I agree [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6115.7s)]
*  Just that statement, oh, we need to nuke them [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6117.7s)]
*  All the people that would die when that shit happens [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6119.7s)]
*  It's just crazy [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6121.7s)]
*  Yeah, they want to hit the nuclear facility [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6123.7s)]
*  They're like, you gotta take this out [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6125.7s)]
*  It's wild [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6127.7s)]
*  I can't have that on my jacket [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6129.7s)]
*  Let's say for example, Iran does get nuclear weapons [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6131.7s)]
*  Right, and I know that they've [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6133.7s)]
*  Flexed and said that they were going to use it [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6135.7s)]
*  If they're not even willing to [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6139.7s)]
*  Escalate past [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6141.7s)]
*  This, in the current [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6143.7s)]
*  Conflict that they have with Israel [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6145.7s)]
*  What evidence is there to say that they will [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6147.7s)]
*  Once they have nukes, knowing full well [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6149.7s)]
*  That if they fire one, Israel's firing one immediately [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6151.7s)]
*  It's usually a sure destruction [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6153.7s)]
*  That is how the Cold War [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6155.7s)]
*  Yeah, I don't really understand the logic [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6157.7s)]
*  Behind it [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6159.7s)]
*  I guess depending on what perspective you would take [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6161.7s)]
*  And I'm kind of guessing here [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6163.7s)]
*  Is that you look at Iran's proxies [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6165.7s)]
*  And you're like, oh, they're agitating in the region [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6167.7s)]
*  Like the last six months specifically [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6169.7s)]
*  Hamas and Hezbollah have been like [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6171.7s)]
*  Sending direct attacks at Israel [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6173.7s)]
*  So Israel's like, oh, they're trying to get rid of us [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6175.7s)]
*  They're trying to eradicate us [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6177.7s)]
*  As themselves, but they might equip [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6179.7s)]
*  Hamas, they might equip Hezbollah [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6181.7s)]
*  And they have been, it seems like [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6183.7s)]
*  So they've already been engaging in this proxy war with us [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6185.7s)]
*  So even though we're not in a declared war [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6187.7s)]
*  We're in war right now [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6189.7s)]
*  So Iran might not do it as themselves [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6191.7s)]
*  They might deny any connection [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6193.7s)]
*  Whatsoever, but they have the capability [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6195.7s)]
*  Of not only [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6197.7s)]
*  Funding, but arming [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6199.7s)]
*  A proxy that absolutely [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6201.7s)]
*  Would, and Israel [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6203.7s)]
*  Can't take that risk. So it's these soft power [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6205.7s)]
*  Plays where it's like, okay, it's Hamas versus Israel [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6207.7s)]
*  But it's also kind of like America [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6209.7s)]

*  Like, it is [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6247.7s)]
*  So much better for us to talk about how horrible [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6249.7s)]
*  Racism and sexism is [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6251.7s)]
*  And be like, we gotta figure this out, we gotta fix this shit [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6253.7s)]

*  We were in [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6285.7s)]
*  Where were we? Charlotte? [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6287.7s)]
*  We were in Charlotte, and we were able to watch it [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6289.7s)]
*  In the green room [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6291.7s)]
*  And it was [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6293.7s)]
*  Yeah, that Max [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6295.7s)]
*  Gagey fight was fucking insane [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6297.7s)]
*  Unbelievable. We were the beasts, bro. Unbelievable. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6299.7s)]
*  I remember him doing that the first time [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6301.7s)]
*  The let's bang in the middle of the ring [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6303.7s)]
*  He did that against, what's the name, I forget [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6305.7s)]
*  But I remember watching him being like, yo, that's so far [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6307.7s)]
*  Kevin told me that was gonna happen [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6309.7s)]
*  Because Max is winning the whole fight [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6311.7s)]
*  And then Kevin was like, yo, at the last like 20 seconds [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6313.7s)]
*  Max is gonna do this shit where he's like, let's come in the center of the ring [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6315.7s)]
*  And let's just swing on each other [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6317.7s)]
*  And then he does this thing he does, like let's just go for it, he's last 20 [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6319.7s)]
*  He just invites the guy to the center of the ring [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6321.7s)]
*  He would, I think every round maybe he lost one [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6323.7s)]
*  But to do that when you're winning [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6325.7s)]
*  Against a guy with crazy knockout power [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6327.7s)]
*  Which apparently Gagey has, I'm obviously casual [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6329.7s)]
*  But to see him do that [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6331.7s)]
*  And then deliver, unfucking [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6333.7s)]
*  Unbelievable, calls him to the center of the ring, they start banging [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6335.7s)]
*  Knocks Gagey out clean [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6337.7s)]
*  With two seconds left [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6339.7s)]
*  Gets fight of the night and knockout of the night [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6341.7s)]
*  Makes $600,000 [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6343.7s)]
*  So far. Unbelievable, dude. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6345.7s)]
*  Unbelievable, we were going nuts. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6347.7s)]
*  Yeah, it was just crazy. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6349.7s)]
*  Just crazy to see. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6351.7s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, Max was a huge underdog in this fight. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6353.7s)]
*  He's coming up in weight to meet Gagey [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6357.7s)]
*  And Gagey is I don't think a small 155. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6359.7s)]
*  No, he looks big. Yeah. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6361.7s)]
*  So it's like, yeah, it was unbelievable. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6363.7s)]
*  And it's tough because it's one of the things [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6365.7s)]
*  Like you start to meet these guys and hang out with them [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6367.7s)]
*  And you, you know, they're really sweet guys [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6369.7s)]
*  So it's hard to root for one of them in there [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6371.7s)]
*  So you're kind of rooting for one of them in there [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6373.7s)]
*  But the best fight often hurts both of them the most [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6375.7s)]
*  It's just, oh, yeah, yeah, it was crazy [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6377.7s)]
*  But Max is just such a fucking stud [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6379.7s)]
*  And now here's this example [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6381.7s)]
*  Like he loses the three fights to Volk [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6383.7s)]
*  You think his career is going downhill [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6385.7s)]
*  Retirement might be coming up [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6387.7s)]
*  All of a sudden he gets a couple big wins [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6389.7s)]
*  And this one right here, now he's on top of the fucking world [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6391.7s)]
*  Yeah. I wonder if he does it to win fight of the nights [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6393.7s)]
*  What? [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6395.7s)]
*  I mean, he's on top of the fucking world [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6397.7s)]
*  Yeah. I wonder if he does it to win fight of the nights [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6399.7s)]
*  Yeah. I wonder if he does it to win fight of the nights [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6401.7s)]
*  I think he's just a Hawaiian who likes to bank [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6403.7s)]
*  He loves to think of the problems [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6405.7s)]
*  I think he's just a Hawaiian who loves to fucking bank [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6407.7s)]
*  Cause I was looking, he's won like seven fight of the nights [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6409.7s)]
*  So here's the thing, not that he said, he's like [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6411.7s)]
*  I knew Justin would have given me that opportunity [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6413.7s)]
*  So I gave it to him [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6415.7s)]
*  What that means to me is [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6417.7s)]
*  He knows he's winning the fight [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6419.7s)]
*  And he's like, Justin would have given me the opportunity [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6421.7s)]
*  To get it back [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6423.7s)]
*  To go all in and get it back [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6425.7s)]
*  To go all in and get it back [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6427.7s)]
*  To go all in and get it back [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6429.7s)]
*  To go all in and get it back [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6431.7s)]
*  With ten seconds left [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6433.7s)]
*  Lose all the hard work you already put out there [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6435.7s)]
*  Exactly. So I gave him the opportunity [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6437.7s)]
*  So he knew he was that far ahead [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6439.7s)]
*  And he still was willing to take that risk [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6441.7s)]
*  And give him that opportunity [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6443.7s)]
*  He also has confidence in his chin [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6445.7s)]
*  I think that's the big thing with Max [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6447.7s)]
*  Where he's just like, I know I can take a shot [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6449.7s)]
*  But if I land [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6451.7s)]
*  There's another thing with Max, yes he [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6453.7s)]
*  He knocked out Korean Zombie with a big overhand right [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6455.7s)]
*  But Max has never been known for one punch power [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6457.7s)]
*  And he's gotten these two [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6459.7s)]
*  Really big knockouts recently [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6461.7s)]
*  Now he's coming up and waiting [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6463.7s)]
*  It looks like he did it right this time [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6465.7s)]
*  When he came up and fought Dustin [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6467.7s)]
*  He didn't do it right [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6469.7s)]
*  This he looks like he actually trained [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6471.7s)]
*  He looked like he filled out [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6473.7s)]
*  Maybe he has more power at this weight [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6475.7s)]
*  Maybe. I mean so cool [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6477.7s)]
*  So now, the world is his [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6479.7s)]
*  He can go back down and fight Ilya [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6481.7s)]
*  He can maybe fight Islan in 155 [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6483.7s)]
*  He can do whatever the fuck he wants [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6485.7s)]
*  He's one of these guys who the people love [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6487.7s)]
*  He's such an endearing fighter [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6489.7s)]
*  That the next fight [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6491.7s)]
*  Is going to be pay per view [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6493.7s)]
*  It's going to be for a belt and it's going to be for crazy money [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6495.7s)]
*  And he's going to fucking cash in [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6497.7s)]
*  And what if he wins back the belt one more time [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6499.7s)]
*  Oh my god [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6501.7s)]
*  I wonder if it almost looks better for Gachie too [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6503.7s)]
*  Because like, if you lose in decision [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6505.7s)]
*  I feel like that looks one way [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6507.7s)]
*  But losing in like just a [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6509.7s)]
*  Just a banging like ending [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6511.7s)]
*  I feel like it looks better [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6513.7s)]
*  It shows that you want to engage [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6515.7s)]
*  I think we'll always watch Justin fight [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6517.7s)]
*  No matter what, he's just such an engaging fighter [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6519.7s)]
*  But the thing with Justin, and I think Max brought this up [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6521.7s)]
*  Is like, Justin didn't need to take this fight [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6523.7s)]
*  So Justin was in line [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6525.7s)]
*  Probably to get a title shot [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6527.7s)]
*  He's taking this fight [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6529.7s)]
*  Which is all risk and no reward [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6531.7s)]
*  If he beats Max, everybody goes, well yeah, you should have beat Max [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6533.7s)]
*  You weigh more than him [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6535.7s)]
*  Your career is more of an upside down [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6537.7s)]
*  Exactly, so he has everything to lose [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6539.7s)]
*  Still takes it because he's that much of a gamer [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6541.7s)]
*  And then he goes out in devastating fashion [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6543.7s)]
*  But yeah, I don't think that he's hurt [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6545.7s)]
*  Like I think anytime he's willing to fight again [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6547.7s)]
*  We're showing up [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6549.7s)]
*  He just might not get, well definitely he's not getting the belt [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6551.7s)]
*  He's not getting the shot for the belt now [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6553.7s)]
*  Can't get the shot for the belt off of L [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6555.7s)]
*  You know, yeah [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6557.7s)]
*  It was cool that Max acknowledged that too [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6559.7s)]
*  That was like the first thing he did, the post fight [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6561.7s)]
*  Yo, Max is the fucking, he said this shit about [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6563.7s)]
*  The Ilya Tuporya guy [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6565.7s)]
*  Like they're like, Ilya was kind of looking the other way after the knockout [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6567.7s)]
*  And then Max, initially [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6569.7s)]
*  Like a reporter is asking that question [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6571.7s)]
*  They're trying to get a good sound bite out of you [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6573.7s)]
*  Max knee jerk goes [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6575.7s)]
*  Well, I mean, I don't know who he is [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6577.7s)]
*  Like maybe he's socially awkward, he doesn't know how to behave in that moment [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6579.7s)]
*  Like he had this really like [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6581.7s)]
*  Empathic reaction [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6583.7s)]
*  You just knocked the guy out [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6585.7s)]
*  You got all the fucking adrenaline going through your system [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6587.7s)]
*  It's easy to go, fuck that guy, I'm gonna take him out [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6589.7s)]
*  Instead he goes, well maybe he didn't know what to do with himself in that moment [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6591.7s)]
*  But what a beautiful thing to say [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6593.7s)]
*  Awesome [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6595.7s)]
*  Right? [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6597.7s)]
*  The whole thing to say, you are the guy [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6599.7s)]
*  And also think of it, if you're Ilya [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6601.7s)]
*  You just watched the guy that now you have to fight [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6603.7s)]
*  Brutally knocked someone out [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6605.7s)]
*  That was bigger than you by 10 pounds [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6607.7s)]
*  And boxed beautifully throughout the five rounds [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6611.7s)]
*  Of course you're not going [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6615.7s)]
*  Awesome, let's go [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6617.7s)]
*  You're thinking, how do I take this guy out, how do I beat him [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6619.7s)]
*  And you know the camera is gonna be on you [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6621.7s)]
*  Anyway, Max is the fucking man [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6623.7s)]
*  And hopefully Jason, Justin [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6625.7s)]
*  You know, rests up and he's good [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6627.7s)]
*  Shout out to Justin as well [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6629.7s)]
*  You know what was also fire is [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6631.7s)]
*  Henry Cejudo and Calvin Gasolin came to the show [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6633.7s)]
*  They're both fucking awesome guys [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6635.7s)]
*  Shouts to you guys, but was also cool [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6637.7s)]
*  I had to miss the last fight of the night [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6639.7s)]
*  The Pereira fight [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6641.7s)]
*  And then they went and watched my set [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6643.7s)]
*  Then we all get off, and then I just hear them analyzing [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6645.7s)]
*  What were they saying? What was their take on it? [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6647.7s)]
*  Well they said something that was interesting about Pereira [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6649.7s)]
*  I'm just like, this guy [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6651.7s)]
*  Scares the fuck out of me, I'm so glad Izzy doesn't want to fight him again [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6653.7s)]
*  We love Izzy, he's terrifying [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6655.7s)]
*  And then Henry is like [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6657.7s)]
*  He also is really good at picking his fights [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6659.7s)]
*  He is fucking great [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6661.7s)]
*  But he also picked very intelligently [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6663.7s)]
*  And he has like a mentor-mentee relationship with Calvin [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6665.7s)]
*  A little bit [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6667.7s)]
*  He's like Calvin, because Calvin seems like he'll just fight anybody [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6669.7s)]
*  I don't give a fuck [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6671.7s)]
*  And he's like Calvin, look what Pereira did [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6673.7s)]
*  He went at the big dogs, got title shots early [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6675.7s)]
*  Got guys that matched up with his style [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6677.7s)]
*  He was very intelligent in how he picked his fights [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6679.7s)]
*  And that's not to say he's not awesome, he's fucking awesome [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6681.7s)]
*  But he also did it very intelligently [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6683.7s)]
*  And I just thought that was a take where [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6685.7s)]
*  I'm such a casual, I'm looking at this guy like [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6687.7s)]
*  Oh, well that's just God [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6689.7s)]
*  In a ring, he cannot be touched [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6691.7s)]
*  I think what Calvin is trying to say is that like [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6693.7s)]
*  He picked fights with guys that are known for their striking [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6695.7s)]
*  Yes [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6697.7s)]
*  And Poetan's strength is his striking [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6699.7s)]
*  He's coming from kickboxing, he doesn't have a big jujitsu background [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6701.7s)]
*  He's wrestling, he doesn't have it all [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6703.7s)]
*  So what he's probably saying is [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6705.7s)]
*  If he was in there with a traditional wrestler [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6707.7s)]
*  It wouldn't be as good of a matchup for him [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6709.7s)]
*  Maybe it wouldn't be great [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6711.7s)]
*  But that being said [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6713.7s)]
*  He came into the UFC [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6715.7s)]
*  And the UFC I'm sure [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6717.7s)]
*  Brought him in for one reason [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6719.7s)]
*  There's one guy on the planet [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6721.7s)]
*  That brutally knocked out their [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6723.7s)]
*  Superstar named [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6725.7s)]
*  Israel Adesanya [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6727.7s)]
*  And that man is Poetan [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6729.7s)]
*  So they're like, if we get this guy in [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6731.7s)]
*  And we feed him a couple of guys that he can knock out [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6733.7s)]
*  We can build up this big fight [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6735.7s)]
*  And boom, we're going to make tons of money [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6737.7s)]
*  And then they had another one and it worked perfectly [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6739.7s)]
*  So it wasn't I don't think as much [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6741.7s)]
*  Him picking his fights [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6743.7s)]
*  I think it was the UFC knowing we want [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6745.7s)]
*  Izzy to fight this guy [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6747.7s)]
*  Because that's what everybody wants [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6749.7s)]
*  And then after that [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6751.7s)]
*  The other people that have been the champs [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6753.7s)]
*  Or the people in line have been strikers [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6755.7s)]
*  Like the fact that Jamal Hill [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6757.7s)]
*  Wanted to strike with him [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6759.7s)]
*  I mean it shows Jamal's confidence in his striking [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6761.7s)]
*  But shit, the next person that gets in there with them [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6763.7s)]
*  Is going for the fucking legs [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6765.7s)]
*  And before the fight we went to lunch [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6767.7s)]
*  And then we're asking him about Jamal Hill's chances [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6769.7s)]
*  And Henry was like, no [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6771.7s)]
*  Pereira is not [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6773.7s)]
*  Pereira is different [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6775.7s)]
*  The first punch he throws, it couldn't cost him [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6777.7s)]
*  It was great [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6779.7s)]
*  I like the hip benefit [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6781.7s)]
*  What was it? [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6783.7s)]
*  The Kavi Lane bro [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6785.7s)]
*  The Tik Tok dude [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6787.7s)]
*  The Italian kid who will do some shit [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6789.7s)]
*  And then show how you should do it easier [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6791.7s)]
*  That's funny you call him Italian [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6793.7s)]
*  The black kid with little teeth [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6795.7s)]
*  The most clearly Italian I've ever seen [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6797.7s)]
*  That's adorable [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6799.7s)]
*  That was the most adorable shit I've ever seen [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6801.7s)]
*  He's so Italian [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6803.7s)]
*  He's probably never been to Africa [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6805.7s)]
*  You could call him the African kid and everybody knows who the fuck you're talking about [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6807.7s)]
*  That guy's Italian, I don't even see [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6809.7s)]
*  Why is he African? Sicilian? [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6811.7s)]
*  Yeah, he must be Sicilian [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6813.7s)]
*  But yeah, it was just fucking crazy [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6815.7s)]
*  That fight [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6817.7s)]
*  I just saw the highlights [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6819.7s)]
*  He got tapped in the nuts and then the ref was going to do something [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6821.7s)]
*  And he was like chill [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6823.7s)]
*  And then knocked the motherfucker out [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6825.7s)]
*  That's insane [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6827.7s)]
*  That's Thanos type shit [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6829.7s)]
*  Let him have fun [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6831.7s)]
*  How many fights has he had so far Pereira? [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6833.7s)]
*  In the UFC? [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6835.7s)]
*  I mean, there's so many kickboxers [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6837.7s)]
*  In the UFC, not that many [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6839.7s)]
*  I forget what it was, I think it was like 7 or 8 fights [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6841.7s)]
*  He's knocked out, or he's beaten 5 belt holders [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6843.7s)]
*  It's like crazy [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6845.7s)]
*  Strickland, Izzy [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6847.7s)]
*  It's unbelievable [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6849.7s)]
*  I mean, I think Strickland before he was a champ [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6851.7s)]
*  It's unprecedented [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6853.7s)]
*  The UFC is killing it [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6855.7s)]
*  They just announced the McGregor fight [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6857.7s)]
*  McGregor Chandler [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6859.7s)]
*  That's going to be wild [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6861.7s)]
*  They're just killing it, they just keep on doing it [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6863.7s)]
*  They have a great roster of fighters [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6865.7s)]
*  And they've conditioned the style [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6867.7s)]
*  Which is [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6869.7s)]
*  It rewards brutality [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6871.7s)]
*  The fighters know if they go in there and perform [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6873.7s)]
*  They make more money [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6875.7s)]
*  Where boxing, they go [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6877.7s)]
*  If I win, I'll get more money [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6879.7s)]
*  So a lot of times boxing matches [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6881.7s)]
*  Don't have even close to brutality [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6883.7s)]
*  Because they have been rewarded for victory [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6885.7s)]
*  Whereas the UFC is [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6887.7s)]
*  Even if you lose [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6889.7s)]
*  If you lose in an exciting way [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6891.7s)]
*  That's the fight of the night shit [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6893.7s)]
*  They should keep that forever [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6895.7s)]
*  It's so smart [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6897.7s)]
*  That's the thing with the UFC, it's more than just like [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6899.7s)]
*  We established this business and then we put on some shows [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6901.7s)]
*  It's the way you've curated a culture of fighting [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6903.7s)]
*  And the way that you've curated an expectation [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6907.7s)]
*  For your fighters and your fans [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6911.7s)]
*  Because now if the fighters go out there [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6913.7s)]
*  And fight an awesome fight [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6915.7s)]
*  For example, Al Jermain went out there and he fought Kader [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6917.7s)]
*  That was awesome too [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6919.7s)]
*  So he fought [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6921.7s)]
*  He fought an awesome technical fight [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6923.7s)]
*  Dominated Kader [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6925.7s)]
*  At one point Suplex [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6927.7s)]
*  Or DDT, it was fucking crazy [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6929.7s)]
*  But it wasn't as engaging and exciting [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6931.7s)]
*  As the UFC fans are used to [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6933.7s)]
*  And he acknowledged it [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6935.7s)]
*  I think Dana defended him [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6937.7s)]
*  But he goes in there knowing it [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6939.7s)]
*  And he's in a tricky situation [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6941.7s)]
*  Where he's like, this is how I know I can beat these guys [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6943.7s)]
*  But if I want to make the most money [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6945.7s)]
*  I'm going to have to take more risk [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6947.7s)]
*  And probably change [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6949.7s)]
*  Certain aspects of my style [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6951.7s)]
*  Or just do DDT's non-stop [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6953.7s)]
*  Because he knows the culture of the UFC [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6955.7s)]
*  And what the fans want [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6957.7s)]
*  And that's important, boxing did not have that [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6959.7s)]
*  Boxing was [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6961.7s)]
*  I love boxing so I like it [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6963.7s)]
*  But I'm going to stick and move, not get touched [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6965.7s)]
*  And then win the belt and then somebody has to try and get the belt for me [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6967.7s)]
*  And since there was nothing else for us to watch [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6969.7s)]
*  In terms of fightsports that we cared about [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6971.7s)]
*  We just paid for it every single time [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6973.7s)]
*  Now there is [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6975.7s)]
*  So you better be fucking exciting [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6977.7s)]
*  Now we're watching Dravante [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6979.7s)]
*  Because Dravante is knocking your fucking head off [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6981.7s)]
*  There's another path [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6983.7s)]
*  If you're not the most technical guy [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6985.7s)]
*  Like a German fighter [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6987.7s)]
*  You can make an amazing career [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6989.7s)]
*  If Floyd is my favorite ever, I think he's the greatest boxer ever [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6991.7s)]
*  I think he's the greatest great ever [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6993.7s)]
*  I don't know if Floyd is even close to his big [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6995.7s)]
*  If he is around at this time [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6997.7s)]
*  He'd be as successful without a doubt [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=6999.7s)]
*  Or maybe he would change his style [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7001.7s)]
*  But knowing, the fans knowing [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7003.7s)]
*  They could go watch UFC and watch carnage [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7005.7s)]
*  And brutality and knockouts and blood [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7007.7s)]
*  I don't know if they're [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7009.7s)]
*  Signing up to watch him [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7011.7s)]
*  Perfectly defend and outpoint his opponent [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7013.7s)]
*  I don't know if he would be as big [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7015.7s)]
*  He would be as dominant without a doubt [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7017.7s)]
*  I'm just asking the question [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7019.7s)]
*  I wonder if he would change his style [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7021.7s)]
*  And take more risk [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7023.7s)]
*  Specifically to compete with what was going on in the UFC [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7025.7s)]
*  Possibly [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7027.7s)]
*  But I just think he [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7029.7s)]
*  The lead up to the fights and the marketing and the branding [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7031.7s)]
*  He's fantastic [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7033.7s)]
*  He sold a story where it's like, oh I want to see this guy lose [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7035.7s)]
*  No, you're right [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7037.7s)]
*  He got in our hearts, he played the emotions [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7039.7s)]
*  Like this Ryan Garcia, Devin Haney fight [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7041.7s)]
*  We're going to watch it [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7043.7s)]
*  And Ryan deserves 90% [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7045.7s)]
*  Of the money for this fight [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7047.7s)]
*  I don't know if Devin said anything the entire time [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7049.7s)]
*  He's just there [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7051.7s)]
*  Devin could be like, I'm not fighting [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7053.7s)]
*  This is with all due respect [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7055.7s)]
*  Devin go, I'm not fighting [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7057.7s)]
*  And Ryan go, okay, I'm fighting Margot Robbie [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7059.7s)]
*  Same amount of people [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7061.7s)]
*  If not more are showing up to watch [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7063.7s)]
*  He's carrying this promotion on his fucking back [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7065.7s)]
*  Devin should be thanking him [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7067.7s)]
*  Every day [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7069.7s)]
*  They're facing off each other, talking shit, cursing him [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7071.7s)]
*  Who are you cursing at? [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7073.7s)]
*  Me? He's going to pay for your kids [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7075.7s)]
*  Your kids, kids, your kids [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7077.7s)]
*  They're going to make crazy money on this fight because Ryan convinced everybody [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7079.7s)]
*  He's fucking crazy [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7081.7s)]
*  You think it's an act? [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7083.7s)]
*  Whatever it is, Devin should be showing up [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7085.7s)]
*  And shaking hands [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7087.7s)]
*  Giving him a hug, asking him if he needs [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7089.7s)]
*  Any bipolar medication [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7091.7s)]
*  And then replacing with placebo [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7093.7s)]
*  So Ryan keeps on doing what he's doing [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7095.7s)]
*  Get out the way and let the man cook [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7097.7s)]
*  This motherfucker is nuts [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7099.7s)]
*  Nah, he going for it [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7101.7s)]
*  He saw a fucking humiliation ritual [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7103.7s)]
*  He saw a fucking... [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7105.7s)]
*  Are you being nuts too if you saw kids get sacrificed [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7107.7s)]
*  That was the most arrogant part [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7109.7s)]
*  You think you're famous enough for all that [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7111.7s)]
*  You the humiliation ritual [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7113.7s)]
*  You're not that big [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7115.7s)]
*  They went out to Victorville, California [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7117.7s)]
*  They scooped you up [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7119.7s)]
*  And they're like, this is the one [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7121.7s)]
*  But no, he's fucking promoting this fight [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7123.7s)]
*  He's saying all that dumb shit [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7125.7s)]
*  And I think that he's smart enough to know [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7127.7s)]
*  I think he's an internet kid, he grew up with it [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7129.7s)]
*  He understands it, he understands the touch points [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7131.7s)]
*  And he's just, I'm going to let it rip [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7133.7s)]
*  That's me personally [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7135.7s)]
*  And good for him [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7137.7s)]
*  And I actually hope it's that [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7139.7s)]
*  Because I don't want to be the other [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7141.7s)]
*  He sounds like Kanye off the bench [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7143.7s)]
*  Yeah, he sounds like a guy who's spiraling [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7145.7s)]
*  And it's probably some mental health stuff [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7147.7s)]
*  Listen, I just hope it's not that [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7149.7s)]
*  Well, Kanye also is a great promoter [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7151.7s)]
*  You know what I mean? Two things can be true [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7153.7s)]
*  Yeah, no, you're right [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7155.7s)]
*  Ryan hasn't gone anti-semitic yet, I don't think [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7157.7s)]
*  So that's how you know [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7159.7s)]
*  Yeah, once they go [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7161.7s)]
*  Once they go anti-semitic, you're like [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7163.7s)]
*  Oh, yeah, he's real now [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7165.7s)]
*  He's real, yeah [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7167.7s)]
*  So yeah, USC 300 was fucking crazy [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7171.7s)]
*  It was wild, amazing card [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7173.7s)]
*  Just an amazing card [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7175.7s)]
*  They did it, they keep doing it [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7177.7s)]
*  Every single time [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7179.7s)]
*  I'm curious about this Chandler-McGregor fight [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7181.7s)]
*  Dude, the way he announced it, I saw the clip of Dana announcing it [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7183.7s)]
*  He gets a piece of paper while he's doing the news conference [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7185.7s)]
*  He's like, I've never had this happen before, I don't know what this is [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7187.7s)]
*  And then he reads it and he goes, oh, alright [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7189.7s)]
*  I guess this is a good time to announce it [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7191.7s)]
*  And then he does the announcement [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7193.7s)]
*  What happened? What did the audience do when he said that? [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7195.7s)]
*  It was a press conference [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7197.7s)]
*  There were some little murmurs, but it wasn't like an audience [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7199.7s)]
*  It was like the press conference [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7201.7s)]
*  To get a piece of paper and be like, what is this? I've never had this happen [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7203.7s)]
*  I'm sure he knew what was going to happen [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7205.7s)]
*  I'm sure it's his idea [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7207.7s)]
*  But to be like, oh, what's this interrupting my press conference? [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7209.7s)]
*  Fantastic [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7211.7s)]
*  Yeah [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7213.7s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's going to be crazy [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7215.7s)]
*  Alright, what else we got going on? [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7217.7s)]
*  You, uh [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7219.7s)]
*  I would need to see this head dinner next to Larry David [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7221.7s)]
*  Oh yeah, Mark and I had dinner next to Larry David [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7223.7s)]
*  Hey, I need to know about this [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7225.7s)]
*  This is insane. Mark, tell us [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7227.7s)]
*  So we're just sitting there, this is the craziest thing [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7229.7s)]
*  So I walk into the restaurant [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7231.7s)]
*  And they were like, okay, where do you guys want to sit? [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7233.7s)]
*  And I was like, they tried to put us at a table, two chairs [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7235.7s)]
*  And I was like, is there anybody who could sit like a booth? I like a booth [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7237.7s)]
*  You know what I mean? It's a nice stretch. Larry likes a booth? [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7239.7s)]
*  I had no idea, I didn't even think about him liking a booth [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7241.7s)]
*  When I made the decision, I was just like [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7243.7s)]
*  This is fine, can we move over here? [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7245.7s)]
*  And they were like, that booth is taken [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7247.7s)]
*  But the booth right next to that booth is wide open [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7249.7s)]
*  So I was like, alright, bet [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7251.7s)]
*  I'm sitting there, little corner booth, hanging out, having a great time eating food [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7253.7s)]
*  Shultz comes, sits down next to me [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7255.7s)]
*  We're just chit chatting [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7257.7s)]
*  And in the middle of him talking [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7259.7s)]
*  This is in LA? Yeah, in the middle of a sentence [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7261.7s)]
*  He's just like, so anyway, yeah, I think one of the things [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7263.7s)]
*  That honestly, holy shit, that's Larry David [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7265.7s)]
*  But sometimes he does this though, we'll be hanging out [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7269.7s)]
*  And he'll just be like, oh my god, is that Dana White? [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7271.7s)]
*  And it'll just be a bald guy [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7273.7s)]
*  He'll just be like, oh, Alex is here? [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7275.7s)]
*  It's just a black guy [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7277.7s)]
*  He'll just be like, oh, that's someone [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7279.7s)]
*  I was like, oh, hilarious, he's going to be an old guy over here [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7281.7s)]
*  So I look over and I was like, holy shit, that's Larry David [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7283.7s)]
*  And then the person brings him over [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7285.7s)]
*  The maitre d' is walking him [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7287.7s)]
*  And just walking directly at our table [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7289.7s)]
*  Hits a right and he's sitting as far away as me and Andrew right now [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7291.7s)]
*  Just sitting there with his daughter [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7293.7s)]
*  Just enjoying [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7295.7s)]
*  I wouldn't talk the whole dinner, I would just listen to Larry David talk [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7297.7s)]
*  It was hard [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7299.7s)]
*  It felt like there was some personal stuff going [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7301.7s)]
*  So I just kind of checked out [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7303.7s)]
*  I didn't even say hello or anything like that [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7305.7s)]
*  Because I felt like there was some personal stuff going on [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7307.7s)]
*  If it was just like a boring lunch date [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7309.7s)]
*  I would have definitely on the way out [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7311.7s)]
*  Be like, hey man, thank you so much, love your work [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7313.7s)]
*  Yeah, he's with his daughter [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7315.7s)]
*  I wanted to cause a problem, I wanted to be like, my food is cold [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7317.7s)]
*  Isn't that annoying? [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7319.7s)]
*  That's the moment to see if he's really out [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7321.7s)]
*  Be like, oh, what should I do with my cold food? [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7323.7s)]
*  Should I send it back? [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7325.7s)]
*  And he's just like, no, just eat it man, that's fine [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7327.7s)]
*  I'd be like, you fucking fraud [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7329.7s)]
*  What the hell? This has all been an act? [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7331.7s)]
*  But no, it was like so crazy, I was so nervous [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7333.7s)]
*  And then your boy Alex [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7335.7s)]
*  He came down [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7337.7s)]
*  Alex comes by [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7339.7s)]
*  Barber Alex comes by and he sits down [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7341.7s)]
*  And he's literally looking at Larry David [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7343.7s)]
*  The entire time [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7345.7s)]
*  And we keep looking at him, he's like, bro, isn't this crazy? [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7347.7s)]
*  He's like, bro, it's wild, right? [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7349.7s)]
*  He had no clue [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7351.7s)]
*  I was like, how crazy is that [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7353.7s)]
*  We're sitting next to Larry David [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7355.7s)]
*  And he goes, that was Larry David? [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7357.7s)]
*  Where? [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7359.7s)]
*  He's sitting in the seat that's directly across from him [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7361.7s)]
*  No clue [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7363.7s)]
*  We were asking, what did you think we were talking about when we were saying it was crazy? [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7365.7s)]
*  He's like, just the food [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7367.7s)]
*  It was wild [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7369.7s)]

*  We're going to be doing them on Patreon [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-745u5kr2bM&t=7383.7s)]
