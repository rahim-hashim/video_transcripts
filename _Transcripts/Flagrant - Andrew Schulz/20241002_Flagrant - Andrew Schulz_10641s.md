# Mark Cuban on Running for Prez, Diddy Parties, & Destroying Big Pharma
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [October 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ)
*  Do you want to be president? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=0.0s)]
*  No, I just don't want to put my kids through that shit. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1.0s)]
*  You don't think Barron Trump and NYU are just mopping up strange? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3.0s)]
*  That's what his form room sounds like. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6.0s)]
*  I'm just saying your kids are going to be good. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10.0s)]
*  They don't want to have secret service around them all the time. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=13.0s)]
*  So Barron made me kid that right, but there's some dude back there going... [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=16.0s)]
*  I'm not saying Kamala is the strongest leader. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=21.0s)]
*  So there's a lot of things I disagree with her on, but I think her heart's in the right place. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=23.0s)]
*  To young entrepreneurs or business owners, what advice would you give them to either scale or look for investors? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=27.0s)]
*  Don't. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=33.0s)]
*  What do you think the general feeling of Americans is? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=34.0s)]
*  Pissed off. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=36.0s)]
*  About? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=37.0s)]
*  Everything. Because everything's a fight. There's no facts we agree on. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=38.0s)]
*  How do we fix inflation? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=41.0s)]
*  Inflation is fixed. The problem is the prices that are already up are already up. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=42.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's going to put himself first. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=46.0s)]
*  You talk about what happened before, every single thing he's done. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=47.0s)]
*  Those 44 cabinet members who came out against him, they didn't say we disagreed. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=50.0s)]
*  They said he was unfit for office because he did shit for himself. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=55.0s)]
*  Luca or Dirk? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=58.0s)]
*  What's up, everybody? Welcome to Flaygrad. Today we're joined by an incredibly illustrious guest. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=62.0s)]
*  I'm very excited. I know the boys are very excited. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=67.0s)]
*  Dreamcast. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=69.0s)]
*  We got big B billionaire, big B billionaire, NBA champion, created the internet, created streaming, created messages that go away. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=70.0s)]
*  Created the baby oil at the Diddy party. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=85.0s)]
*  Is Mark Cuban here? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=90.0s)]
*  So first question is, have you been to any Diddy parties? We need to ask all our billionaire friends. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=95.0s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=98.0s)]
*  Epstein's Allen? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=99.0s)]
*  No. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=100.0s)]
*  That was a hesitation. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=101.0s)]
*  No, because I didn't put Epstein. No, absolutely not. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=102.0s)]
*  So it's so funny when all that shit happened with Epstein, because I do email everything. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=105.0s)]
*  So I do everything via email. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=109.0s)]
*  So I'm putting in Jeffrey Epstein, Jeff Epstein. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=112.0s)]
*  And you respond to every email. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=117.0s)]
*  I respond to all of them. But some dude that was kind of sketchy said, hey, I got this guy I want to introduce you to, Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=119.0s)]
*  He does all this money management and stuff. I'm like, nah. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=127.0s)]
*  Smart move. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=131.0s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=133.0s)]
*  But if he sent you, I've got a 17-year-old Eastern European, you'd be like, is his name Luca? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=134.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=139.0s)]
*  I'm like, I know what direction you are going. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=140.0s)]
*  Nail or finger? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=143.0s)]
*  Nail or finger. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=145.0s)]
*  Play with balls. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=146.0s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=147.0s)]
*  Yeah, so but Diddy did, I did do business with him in 2002, I think it was, where somebody that knew him connected him to me and said, hey, would you be interested in having him design a Mavs jersey? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=148.0s)]
*  I remember the Sean John jersey. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=163.0s)]
*  And so I was like, cool. And he didn't do the actual work, but we had the jersey and that was it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=164.0s)]
*  This is when we all loved Diddy, though. Everybody loved Diddy until like about two months ago. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=169.0s)]
*  This is Sean John. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=173.0s)]
*  Sean John. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=175.0s)]
*  No, it was green. It was like straight up green, but it was badass. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=176.0s)]
*  The shiny seat. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=182.0s)]
*  But I've met him twice. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=183.0s)]
*  So you're clean. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=184.0s)]
*  I'm clean, right? I never saw him on the illegal baby oil market. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=185.0s)]
*  Just legal baby oil market. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=191.0s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=193.0s)]
*  So here's the thing that like I'm so interested about you, right, is because I feel like, and I don't know what it's like in your position, but I feel like up until election time, you are everybody's favorite billionaire, successful. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=194.0s)]
*  I don't want to say rags to riches, but like really self-made. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=207.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=210.0s)]
*  And you are smart enough to know that if you get political, half the country goes, you know what, fuck that guy. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=211.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=219.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=220.0s)]
*  Why put yourself through it? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=221.0s)]
*  You made all the money. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=222.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=223.0s)]
*  You did everything. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=224.0s)]
*  Everybody is basically up until a few months ago. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=225.0s)]
*  I don't want to say everybody, but a lot of people are like, conservatives are like, he's a businessman. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=227.0s)]
*  He's smart. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=231.0s)]
*  He'd be a good president. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=232.0s)]
*  Liberals are like, he seems to care about people. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=233.0s)]
*  All his employees tend to be like fucking millionaires and shit. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=235.0s)]
*  Like, I think he'd be a good president. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=237.0s)]
*  And then you go in on Trump and Elon. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=239.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=241.0s)]
*  I mean, because I care what happens to this country. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=242.0s)]
*  You know, I've known Donald Trump for 25 years. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=245.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=247.0s)]
*  If he were sitting here, I'd cut it up with him. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=248.0s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=249.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=250.0s)]
*  I wouldn't want to do business with him again. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=251.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=252.0s)]
*  But I don't have a problem with him as a guy. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=253.0s)]
*  But I know how he does business. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=254.0s)]
*  He did piss you off many years ago. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=256.0s)]
*  I watched you on Letterman. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=258.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=259.0s)]
*  Well, I like to fuck with them. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=260.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=261.0s)]
*  It's just like, it's like Elon. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=262.0s)]
*  It's not like I have anything personal against him. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=263.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=265.0s)]
*  But if somebody is at a certain level, if they're going to fuck with me, because he would tweet at me, I'm going to fuck with them right back. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=266.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=270.0s)]
*  Why would I not? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=271.0s)]
*  And so, and it's the same with Elon. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=272.0s)]
*  But the bigger picture is, I just don't think he was a very good president then. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=274.0s)]
*  I don't think he'll be a very good president again. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=278.0s)]
*  And that's in a nutshell. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=281.0s)]
*  Like if he didn't run, it's like, okay, so backstory, right? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=282.0s)]
*  Like I did this movie, Sharknado 3. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=285.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=288.0s)]
*  And I played the president in Sharknado 3. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=289.0s)]
*  But they offered it to Donald Trump first, and he couldn't schedule it. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=291.0s)]
*  If he had scheduled that, the world would be a different place. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=294.0s)]
*  Because he wouldn't be able to be president. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=298.0s)]
*  He wouldn't be doing all that shit, right? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=300.0s)]
*  He already played a big movie. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=301.0s)]
*  Because we filmed it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=302.0s)]
*  No, we filmed it right around the same time that he was doing all the stuff. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=303.0s)]
*  He'd come down the stairs and everything. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=308.0s)]
*  And so who knows what would happen. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=310.0s)]
*  But I just, to me, character matters, right? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=311.0s)]
*  The type of person they are. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=316.0s)]
*  And I know people he's ripped off. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=317.0s)]
*  I mean, Trump University, Trump Soho, that shit matters to me. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=319.0s)]
*  And it's not just about policies. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=323.0s)]
*  It's about who the person is. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=326.0s)]
*  And so again, if he was here and we were just shooting the shit, telling stories, yeah, we'd cut it up. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=328.0s)]
*  But not as president. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=334.0s)]
*  And can you break it down for some people who might not know Trump Soho, maybe? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=335.0s)]
*  Just one of the scandals. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=338.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, so Trump University. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=340.0s)]
*  It's a Dominic O'Toole. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=342.0s)]
*  Can you let him do it? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=343.0s)]
*  I don't understand what you're... [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=345.0s)]
*  What is that? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=346.0s)]
*  I don't even know what they changed it to, right? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=347.0s)]
*  The Dominic? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=349.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=350.0s)]
*  And so I knew I loved that place. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=351.0s)]
*  And so he lied about the value of condos in that building and people bought them. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=354.0s)]
*  And so... [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=360.0s)]
*  He does that. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=361.0s)]
*  He does that, right? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=362.0s)]
*  Trump University. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=363.0s)]
*  He said, give me these thousands of dollars and come and show up to these, not even classes, but seminars or whatever. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=364.0s)]
*  And you'll learn all about real estate and you'll meet Donald Trump. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=373.0s)]
*  Well, the Donald Trump you met was a big cutout. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=377.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=380.0s)]
*  And so... [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=382.0s)]
*  What's more valuable, that or like a feminism major at Berkeley? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=383.0s)]
*  Barnard. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=388.0s)]
*  I might go for the Trump University. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=390.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=392.0s)]
*  There might be some information that we could learn from that. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=393.0s)]
*  So to his point, the real estate thing, that seems like we are told that's just something rich people kind of do. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=395.0s)]
*  Fuck no. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=399.0s)]
*  Inflate the value. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=400.0s)]
*  Can you explain why you have an issue with that? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=401.0s)]
*  Why there might be a problem? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=402.0s)]
*  Look, like, if I'm doing a deal, I'm telling you the truth. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=403.0s)]
*  What do I have to gain by lying? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=408.0s)]
*  You could be so much more wealthy, dude. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=410.0s)]
*  It sucks you only worth a few billion. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=412.0s)]
*  You're so ethical. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=414.0s)]
*  No, that was back in the day. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=415.0s)]
*  It's more than that. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=416.0s)]
*  Oh, you got it now? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=417.0s)]
*  Okay, Mark! [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=418.0s)]
*  Okay! [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=419.0s)]
*  That's so... [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=420.0s)]
*  Prove it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=421.0s)]
*  Give him 50 million. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=422.0s)]
*  Okay, shit, that's small. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=423.0s)]
*  Okay, you give me more. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=424.0s)]
*  Fuck it. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=427.0s)]
*  That's a run-and-up. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=428.0s)]
*  You get it, right? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=429.0s)]
*  Do you ever want to do that, though? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=431.0s)]
*  Isn't that kind of funny? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=432.0s)]
*  Like, you ever see like a guy on the street like pushing a stroller and you're like, man, you need to be a millionaire. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=433.0s)]
*  Yeah, so. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=437.0s)]
*  But do you ever do that? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=438.0s)]
*  Do you ever do that? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=439.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=440.0s)]
*  You're like, all right, I'm going to give that guy a million dollars. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=441.0s)]
*  No, I mean, I've done shit for people. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=442.0s)]
*  And like, yeah, there's like a couple of my guys that I grew up with or that I got to be close with that are down on a luck. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=444.0s)]
*  And like, you do it as a loan, right? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=451.0s)]
*  Just to set it up. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=453.0s)]
*  But, you know, they pay me back a hundred bucks a month or whatever. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=454.0s)]
*  But yeah, over a million dollars to some of them because those are my guys. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=458.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=462.0s)]
*  So. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=463.0s)]
*  Yeah, you didn't just give them the money, you still got to pay you back. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=464.0s)]
*  Yeah, I said you got to pay me back. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=467.0s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=468.0s)]
*  If you don't get rich, you're giving away money, Rob. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=469.0s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=472.0s)]
*  You know what happens? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=473.0s)]
*  I said, just this one time. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=474.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=475.0s)]
*  Just this one time. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=476.0s)]
*  Because I think they're going to pay you back. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=477.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=478.0s)]
*  And then then it gets uncomfortable. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=479.0s)]
*  Then it's like, fuck it. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=480.0s)]
*  No, really? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=481.0s)]
*  50 million? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=482.0s)]
*  Just this one time. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=483.0s)]
*  Just this one time. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=484.0s)]
*  I'm never going to ask you for another fucking penny again. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=485.0s)]
*  Just the tip. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=486.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=487.0s)]
*  You have been a dickhead. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=488.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=490.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=491.0s)]
*  This is something I think I was caught up in narrative. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=492.0s)]
*  I think a lot of times when you're just looking at headlines on the internet, you're just [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=498.0s)]
*  looking at Twitter, right? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=502.0s)]
*  When things got political around the election, especially with you, and you started going [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=504.0s)]
*  at Trump and Elon, my interpretation, I'll be honest with you, I was like, did he become [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=507.0s)]
*  some democratic operative? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=512.0s)]
*  No. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=514.0s)]
*  What? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=515.0s)]
*  Because I always knew you as the rebellious guy, disruptor. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=516.0s)]
*  You're the most fined owner in NBA history. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=521.0s)]
*  You come in, you're going to do whatever you want. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=523.0s)]
*  It's going to end up working out. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=525.0s)]
*  You create these companies that disrupt. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=527.0s)]
*  You start streaming. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=529.0s)]
*  Literally, I don't even think people realize that. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=530.0s)]
*  I researched this. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=532.0s)]
*  And then I see you going after Trump and Elon, and I interpret it like, I guess he kind of [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=533.0s)]
*  folded. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=540.0s)]
*  I guess he became an additional billionaire. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=541.0s)]
*  No, it's the exact opposite. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=542.0s)]
*  It's the exact opposite. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=543.0s)]
*  You've got a former president who lies his ass off and talks shit. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=544.0s)]
*  Someone said gangster. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=547.0s)]
*  He's just going to do his thing. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=549.0s)]
*  Then you've got the richest motherfucker in the world. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=550.0s)]
*  I mean, what's more anti-establishment than fucking with those two? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=552.0s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=557.0s)]
*  So when you're a billionaire, the only other people you can be more powerful or more rich. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=558.0s)]
*  Who else am I going to fuck with? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=565.0s)]
*  He's just a misfit. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=567.0s)]
*  I'm not going to pick on other people just because. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=568.0s)]
*  What's the point of picking on people just to pick on them? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=570.0s)]
*  Oh, you're just bored. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=572.0s)]
*  No, it's not that. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=573.0s)]
*  It's the right thing. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=574.0s)]
*  It's the right thing. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=575.0s)]
*  I mean, it's like on Trump, I just don't think he's a good president. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=576.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=579.0s)]
*  Like if he didn't run for president, I wouldn't fuck with him. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=580.0s)]
*  I wouldn't care. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=582.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=583.0s)]
*  Now, we did have this back and forth like on Twitter, like I don't golf, right? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=584.0s)]
*  I've golfed once in my entire life. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=588.0s)]
*  It was customer golf and I was like throwing clubs, all the bullshit, right? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=590.0s)]
*  I'm like, that's a bad idea. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=593.0s)]
*  And so he like tweets these shit like I saw him golf. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=595.0s)]
*  He hits like a girl. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=598.0s)]
*  I'm like, I don't fucking golf, right? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=599.0s)]
*  You know, he does bullshit stuff and just lies his ass off. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=601.0s)]
*  And so it's just easy to fuck with him. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=604.0s)]
*  And it's just fun to fuck with him. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=606.0s)]
*  And the fact that he's running for president doesn't change any of that. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=608.0s)]
*  I mean, that's just who he is. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=612.0s)]
*  He lies his ass off all the time. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=614.0s)]
*  Do you want to be president? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=615.0s)]
*  No. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=616.0s)]
*  I'm dying for you to be president. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=617.0s)]
*  No, man. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=618.0s)]
*  2028, your kids are grown. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=619.0s)]
*  Let's do it. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=620.0s)]
*  What are we talking about? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=621.0s)]
*  Never. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=622.0s)]
*  Never. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=623.0s)]
*  Okay, question. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=624.0s)]
*  Do you have too many skeletons in your closet to be president? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=625.0s)]
*  No, I just don't want to put my kids through that shit. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=626.0s)]
*  You know, I just, I mean, they're 15, 18 and 21 now. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=627.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=630.0s)]
*  And you see all the shit that people get. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=631.0s)]
*  19, 20, 25 and 40. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=632.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=633.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they're grown, but you still don't want to put your kids through all that. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=634.0s)]
*  You don't think Barron Trump and NYU is just mopping up strange? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=638.0s)]
*  This probably is. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=641.0s)]
*  He's closing deals. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=642.0s)]
*  He probably is, like NYU. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=643.0s)]
*  We had a family vote. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=644.0s)]
*  That's what his form room sounds like. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=645.0s)]
*  Just. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=646.0s)]
*  You know, your kids are going to be fine. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=647.0s)]
*  I'm just saying, your kids are going to be fine. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=648.0s)]
*  I hear you know, but we had a family vote for real. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=649.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=666.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=667.22s)]
*  What was the number? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=668.22s)]
*  There was four to one. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=669.22s)]
*  I was the one. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=670.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=671.22s)]
*  Wait, they said yes and you said no. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=672.22s)]
*  They said no. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=673.22s)]
*  They said no. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=674.22s)]
*  Okay, so you did have aspirations at one point. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=675.22s)]
*  I was curious, right? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=676.22s)]
*  We had the conversation at the dinner table. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=677.22s)]
*  I don't want to have Secret Service around them all the time and all that stuff, right? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=678.44s)]
*  That's not a life. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=681.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=682.9200000000001s)]
*  You know, they don't want to have to deal with, you know, having somebody there all [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=683.9200000000001s)]
*  the time. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=685.72s)]
*  So Barron made me get there, right? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=686.72s)]
*  But there's some dude back there going, ha ha ha ha. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=687.72s)]
*  Oh my God, listen to Barron come and get you. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=690.72s)]
*  He's reporting back. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=693.72s)]
*  He goes, now he's still going. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=694.72s)]
*  He got him. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=695.72s)]
*  Oh, that's okay. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=696.72s)]
*  That's fair. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=697.72s)]
*  I do think that that is the selfless decision, of course, to look out for. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=698.72s)]
*  Plus, like, I just wouldn't be good at that shit, right? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=708.22s)]
*  Just like all the ceremonial stuff you have to go through. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=711.22s)]
*  And just, that's just not me. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=715.22s)]
*  I'd be just like, fuck it, we're doing it this way. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=717.22s)]
*  No, you got to go through Congress. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=719.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's just not me. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=721.22s)]
*  That's the thing where I feel like it's difficult for business owners because it is a different [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=722.22s)]
*  skill, right? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=725.22s)]
*  Totally different. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=726.22s)]
*  Now, your goal is to hinder to eliminate bureaucracy and government is nothing but [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=727.22s)]
*  bureaucracy. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=731.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=732.22s)]
*  I mean, look, you can say, okay, I'm going to cut back like Elon's done, right? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=733.22s)]
*  He talks about, and that's cool, right? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=734.22s)]
*  I'm all for that. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=735.22s)]
*  But you still got to follow all the rules. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=736.72s)]
*  You can talk all you want about, oh, we're just going to cut this and cut that. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=738.72s)]
*  But it don't work that way. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=741.72s)]
*  Once you own a team, though, and then once you're in real estate, aren't you like a [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=743.72s)]
*  pseudo politician? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=748.72s)]
*  Like, in order to get things done, don't you have to do the schmooze a little? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=749.72s)]
*  I never did that shit. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=753.72s)]
*  Nothing? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=754.72s)]
*  That's why I got fined all the time. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=755.72s)]
*  I didn't give a fuck. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=756.72s)]
*  But what about from the city, when you're trying to get a new stadium built? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=757.72s)]
*  They built it before and I sold to a guy who will do it, right? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=761.72s)]
*  That's one of the reasons I sold most of the team. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=766.22s)]
*  Why did you sell it? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=768.22s)]
*  Because I'm just not good at that shit. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=769.22s)]
*  To compete now with the new collective bargaining agreement, you see all these teams build in [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=770.22s)]
*  real estate and casinos and all these big real estate empires. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=774.98s)]
*  I'm like, that's not me. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=778.22s)]
*  I'm not into real estate. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=779.7s)]
*  Like when it was tech and media, golden, right? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=780.7s)]
*  That's my competency. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=783.7s)]
*  But to go build shit and put up a billion dollars or two billion or have to borrow? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=786.7s)]
*  No, man, that's not me. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=791.7s)]
*  And that just doesn't fit me. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=793.22s)]
*  And then going back to my kids, imagine you're 15, 18 and 21 now. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=794.72s)]
*  And in 10 years, it's like, okay, do I have to take over the family business? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=799.72s)]
*  It's a lot of pressure. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=803.72s)]
*  It's a lot of pressure. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=804.72s)]
*  And you see different teams where the kids just take over. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=805.72s)]
*  It don't always work out. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=808.72s)]
*  And those kids aren't always real happy. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=809.72s)]
*  And particularly when you're my kid, I mean, you know what it's like, right? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=811.72s)]
*  People know who you are and they know your kids and they just have certain expectations. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=814.72s)]
*  I want them to be themselves and do their own thing. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=818.72s)]
*  And it's not like if I don't do it, I'm not going to have fun or do shit I like to do. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=822.22s)]
*  Right? I get to do more of it. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=826.22s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=828.22s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=829.22s)]
*  You said something interesting about like the teams are building like casinos. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=830.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=833.22s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=834.22s)]
*  Like I understood that that was part of the idea behind the sale to what was it? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=835.22s)]
*  The Adelson's? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=839.22s)]
*  Yeah, the Adelson's. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=840.22s)]
*  And they are they own the Sands? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=841.22s)]
*  Yeah, they run Bally's and they own Sands. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=842.22s)]
*  They own Sands, run Sands corporations. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=845.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=847.22s)]
*  So but is that other teams are doing it? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=848.22s)]
*  And this is just like a way to monetize the team in different? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=849.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=851.72s)]
*  I mean, you know, you've got Boston is building a whole real estate thing. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=852.72s)]
*  Sacramento did. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=855.72s)]
*  Golden State did. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=859.72s)]
*  So the idea is you buy the area. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=860.72s)]
*  You buy all the land around it. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=862.72s)]
*  Yeah, you build all the real estate up around it and you make more money off the real estate than you do off the team. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=863.72s)]
*  Because McDonald's model. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=868.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=871.72s)]
*  But what's interesting is you can really develop an area like any place where. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=872.72s)]
*  Because you know, there's going to be a ton of people going all the time. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=878.22s)]
*  So you put stuff all around restaurants around. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=880.22s)]
*  They have bars around there. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=882.22s)]
*  That's OK. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=883.22s)]
*  And is that because is that just because they're trying to squeeze more money or is that because with the new CBA, you have to the owners have to pay out so much? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=885.22s)]
*  It's just cost more. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=892.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=893.22s)]
*  There's a new TV deal that pay a bunch of it. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=894.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=896.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=897.22s)]
*  But in order to it's like an arms race. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=898.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=899.22s)]
*  Because there's always new technology. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=900.22s)]
*  There's always new stuff. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=901.22s)]
*  Contracts are going up. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=902.22s)]
*  You don't know what's going to happen to take your prices. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=903.22s)]
*  And if something happens to media, right, because media is all ups and up and down. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=905.72s)]
*  So even with the new TV deal, 10 years from now, five years from now, whatever things could be upside down. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=908.72s)]
*  And so if you build all this shit, you got to cover. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=914.72s)]
*  Guys, life tour here. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=917.72s)]

*  Let's get back to the show. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=955.22s)]
*  All right, guys, let's talk some shows. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=956.22s)]
*  First of all, everybody in India Junior, by which I mean New Jersey. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=958.22s)]
*  I told you all these shows would sell out in advance. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=962.22s)]
*  October 17th through 19th. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=964.22s)]
*  We sold out all five shows a month in advance. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=965.72s)]
*  But we're adding, we decided to add another show. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=967.72s)]
*  Thursday late show, I believe as of now. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=969.72s)]
*  Double check the website. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=971.72s)]
*  Probably going to be 9.15, but get those tickets. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=972.72s)]
*  Also October 10th, Poughkeepsie. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=974.72s)]
*  I'm doing a little one night gig trying to work some shit out. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=975.72s)]
*  That should be fun. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=977.72s)]
*  October 25th and 26th, Richmond, Virginia. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=978.72s)]
*  November 1st and 2nd, Lexington. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=980.72s)]
*  And also, quick announcement. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=982.72s)]
*  I am going to be joining FanBasis. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=984.72s)]
*  It is a website where I'm going to get picks from betters. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=988.72s)]
*  Like professional gamblers are going to give me picks that you could use on stake. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=993.22s)]
*  But you're going to get the picks from me who got them from somebody who knows way more than me. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=997.22s)]
*  And more importantly, we're going to talk sports. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1001.22s)]
*  So if you miss Sports Talk, like I do, let's just come chat a little bit. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1003.22s)]
*  We'll do some live streams. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1007.22s)]
*  We'll have some fun. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1008.22s)]
*  We'll talk some shit. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1009.22s)]
*  We'll form a little community. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1010.22s)]
*  I think Akash Betz is the Instagram. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1011.22s)]
*  But either way, I'm very excited about this. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1013.22s)]
*  Hopefully we make y'all money. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1015.22s)]
*  We'll definitely help you lose less. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1016.22s)]
*  You can't gamble for shit on your own. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1018.22s)]
*  But check that out if you can. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1020.22s)]
*  New York City, Stanford, Connecticut, Pottstown PA. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1022.72s)]
*  That's right. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1025.72s)]
*  I am coming to all of those cities. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1026.72s)]
*  I got shows coming up in the next couple months. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1028.72s)]
*  New York City, tonight, October 2nd, Mary Lou. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1030.72s)]
*  I'm doing a monthly show that will become a weekly show. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1034.72s)]
*  It's the hottest show in New York City. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1037.72s)]

*  And then Pottstown PA on November 8th. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1053.22s)]
*  I'm sure you're wondering, Mark, why are you talking right now? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1055.22s)]
*  You're not on this episode. You're not even here. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1057.22s)]
*  That's right. I'm not here. I'm in the woods. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1059.22s)]
*  I'm deep in the woods, in my tent. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1061.22s)]
*  But I have really exciting news to tell you guys. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1063.22s)]
*  That's why I'm not on this episode. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1065.22s)]
*  I'm so excited to tell everyone what's going on. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1067.22s)]
*  It's going to be really, really cool. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1069.22s)]
*  But we'll talk about that in a couple weeks. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1071.22s)]
*  Let's get back to the show. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1073.22s)]
*  So to that point, you made your money getting out of Yahoo before the bubble burst. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1075.22s)]
*  Is that part of the rationale behind selling the team now? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1077.22s)]
*  No, man. No. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1079.72s)]
*  No, I promise you. No. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1083.72s)]
*  No. No. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1085.72s)]
*  Sell! Sell! [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1087.72s)]
*  No. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1089.72s)]
*  How much higher can the TV money go? That's like a question I have. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1091.72s)]
*  There's that... [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1093.72s)]
*  I'm sure this is a fabricated story, but the... [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1095.72s)]
*  Was it JP Morgan or something? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1097.72s)]
*  People have described it to a bunch of different people, but like [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1099.72s)]
*  the guy who was shining his shoes was telling him what stocks he was buying. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1101.72s)]
*  And then this is in like 1929. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1104.72s)]
*  And he went back to the office. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1106.72s)]
*  He was like, sell everything. There's nobody left to buy. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1108.72s)]
*  Right, because the shoe shiners... [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1110.72s)]
*  So the second you started selling? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1112.72s)]
*  In 2000, that was the thing, right? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1114.72s)]
*  But no, not now. No, no. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1116.72s)]
*  If I was 20 years younger, it would be a different story. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1118.72s)]
*  Because then I'd have time to learn, and I didn't have the kids, and all that stuff. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1120.72s)]
*  It's just... [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1122.72s)]
*  I want to spend time with my fucking kids. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1124.72s)]
*  They're at that age now where... [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1126.72s)]
*  It's why I left Shark Tank. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1128.72s)]
*  Because we'd shoot Shark Tank in June and September. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1130.72s)]
*  And that's right when they're getting out of school and going back to school. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1132.72s)]
*  Two of my kids' birthdays are in September. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1134.72s)]
*  And so I was like, I was missing that shit. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1136.72s)]
*  And so now it's just like, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1138.72s)]
*  leave us alone, Dad. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1140.72s)]
*  We know. My son, 15, he goes, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1142.72s)]
*  I need to breathe, Dad. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1144.72s)]
*  I need to breathe. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1146.72s)]
*  You know what's fascinating? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1148.72s)]
*  No matter how cool or rich you are, your kids are still going to be like, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1150.72s)]
*  go fuck yourself. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1152.72s)]
*  So that's just like... [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1154.72s)]
*  You can't get that back. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1156.72s)]
*  You cannot get that back. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1158.72s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1160.72s)]
*  What about the... [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1162.72s)]
*  This is a random question, but like, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1164.72s)]
*  how many of the deals on Shark Tank do you guys actually end up going in business with? [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1166.72s)]
*  Probably. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1170.72s)]
*  For me, for the first 12 years, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1172.72s)]
*  for me it was like 70%. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1174.72s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1176.72s)]
*  So after they present, you offer them... [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1178.72s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1180.72s)]
*  And they say yes. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1182.72s)]
*  Then we do due diligence, right? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1184.72s)]
*  So you get to go through... [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1186.72s)]
*  To make sure that they're telling the truth. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1188.72s)]
*  So like 30, 40%, give or take, are full of shit. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1190.72s)]
*  We don't have any debt. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1192.72s)]
*  You have $200,000 on your credit card. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1194.72s)]
*  Oh, it's credit card, it's not real debt. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1196.72s)]
*  Just bullshit stuff. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1198.72s)]
*  It cost us a buck to make this widget. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1200.72s)]
*  Then you go in and look, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1202.72s)]
*  wait, it cost you five bucks. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1204.72s)]
*  Well, if we make a million of them, it's just bullshit. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1206.72s)]
*  And so they don't close for that reason. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1208.72s)]
*  But now the show's gotten so big, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1210.72s)]
*  people have watched all the episodes and figured it all out. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1212.72s)]
*  So they figured the game out. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1214.72s)]
*  And so now they go in and say all the right things. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1216.72s)]
*  And then they don't even do due diligence. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1218.72s)]
*  They're like, fuck it, I don't care. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1220.72s)]
*  I don't need the investment. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1222.72s)]
*  They're going on for the promo. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1224.72s)]
*  It's an advertisement. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1226.72s)]
*  There's multiple products I've looked up. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1228.72s)]
*  None of you guys invested, but that looks good. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1230.72s)]
*  I'm going to look that up. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1232.72s)]
*  Is there anything that you made insane money on? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1234.72s)]
*  From Shark Tank? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1236.72s)]
*  Have you all heard of Dude Wipes? [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1238.72s)]
*  Yeah, we have them here. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1240.72s)]
*  Dude Wipes killed it. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1242.72s)]
*  Have you heard of Beatbox Beverages? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1244.72s)]
*  That one has not. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1246.72s)]
*  Dude Wipes is one of the most famous [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1248.72s)]
*  beverage campuses and killing it. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1250.72s)]
*  So I gave them a million dollars for 33% of the company. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1252.72s)]
*  And I've been diluted now, but they just did a fundraising [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1254.72s)]
*  at $200 million. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1256.72s)]
*  Dude Wipes will do $150 million in revenue this year. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1258.72s)]
*  I think I gave them $250 grand for 20% of the company. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1260.72s)]
*  And they're worth a couple hundred million now. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1262.72s)]
*  So no, I'm good. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1264.72s)]
*  I'm straight. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1266.72s)]
*  No, I haven't turned that into cash. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1268.72s)]
*  But yeah, on an evaluation basis, I'm good. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1270.72s)]
*  What is the most money you've lost on something? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1272.72s)]
*  What is the most money you've lost on something? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1274.72s)]
*  Because everybody knows your success. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1276.72s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1278.72s)]
*  I think I lost like, I had this company Motion Loft, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1280.72s)]
*  and the guy like stole money from it and ended up going to jail. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1284.72s)]
*  And I think I lost 15 mil on that too. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1288.72s)]
*  Wow, you put 15 mil cash. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1290.72s)]
*  Yeah, it was over a period of time. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1292.72s)]
*  And that's the most you've ever lost? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1294.72s)]
*  Yeah, pretty much. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1296.72s)]
*  Why am I like, that's not that much? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1298.72s)]
*  No, it's a lot. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1300.72s)]
*  Someone's dying. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1302.72s)]
*  But for you... [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1304.72s)]
*  No, it's a lot. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1306.72s)]
*  I had one for 8 million. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1308.72s)]
*  The ones where I've really gotten killed, somebody fucked up bad. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1310.72s)]
*  Someone stole? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1312.72s)]
*  There was corruption with the company. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1314.72s)]
*  Was there ever something where you... [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1316.72s)]
*  Because I think you've been good in terms of like, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1318.72s)]
*  there's two... [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1320.72s)]
*  I have time periods of tech, I feel. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1322.72s)]
*  Maybe there's multiple, and I'm not being nuanced enough. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1324.72s)]
*  But there's the initial one, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1326.72s)]
*  which you cashed in on right before the bubble. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1328.72s)]
*  The internet. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1330.72s)]
*  And then there is the app. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1332.72s)]
*  Yeah, internet, apps, AI. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1334.72s)]
*  Oh, and the AI is the third. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1336.72s)]
*  Your first wave. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1338.72s)]
*  Are you and your other cohorts that are first wave, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1342.72s)]
*  do you look at these next people as like, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1346.72s)]
*  the young rugrats trying to make it? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1348.72s)]
*  Yeah, kind of. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1350.72s)]
*  Do they see you as like the OGs? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1352.72s)]
*  Or is there separation? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1354.72s)]
*  All the time, yeah. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1356.72s)]
*  But to me, that's motivation. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1358.72s)]
*  So the businesses I'm in, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1360.72s)]
*  it's like CosplusDrugs.com, whatever. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1362.72s)]
*  I'm like, okay, used to be the young dude walking in the room, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1364.72s)]
*  now I'm the old dude walking in the room, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1366.72s)]
*  I'm going to prove to you I'm going to kick your ass. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1368.72s)]
*  Is there anything about this young group of Silicon Valley people [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1370.72s)]
*  that you're frustrated with? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1372.72s)]
*  There was a guy on Shark Tank, I've read his name. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1374.72s)]
*  No, because I never really cared about Silicon Valley, right? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1376.72s)]
*  A lot of shit got done there, don't get me wrong, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1378.72s)]
*  but that was never where I liked to work. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1380.72s)]
*  To me, the tech bros and everything, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1382.72s)]
*  they had their own draw. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1384.72s)]
*  I like Silicon Alley, right? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1386.72s)]
*  Here in New York, that was better. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1388.72s)]
*  What was going on in Dallas was better, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1390.72s)]
*  Chicago, just because there's normal people. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1392.72s)]
*  The people in the Valley just have this, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1394.72s)]
*  like we're the shit. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1396.72s)]
*  But you didn't need the developers, you didn't need the brains? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1398.72s)]
*  No, there's plenty of brains elsewhere, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1400.72s)]
*  and it was cheaper and easier and better. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1402.72s)]
*  Every company I've done has been out of Dallas. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1404.72s)]
*  Really? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1406.72s)]
*  This is the pharmaceutical one? [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1408.72s)]
*  From Broadcast.com, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1410.72s)]
*  to HDNet, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1412.72s)]
*  to CosplusDrugs.com, you name it. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1414.72s)]
*  The Cosplus Drugs thing is interesting, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1416.72s)]
*  because you'd figure that [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1418.72s)]
*  you would have been [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1420.72s)]
*  suicided by now [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1422.72s)]
*  for trying to go at the pharmaceutical companies. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1424.72s)]
*  Why does that not happen? [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1426.72s)]
*  Don't give him my deal. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1428.72s)]
*  I'm really high profile, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1430.72s)]
*  I'm not some dude that just hides in the corner. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1432.72s)]
*  If they kill you, then it's obvious. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1434.72s)]
*  Everybody knows what's going on, right? [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1436.72s)]
*  They'll talk shit about me, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1438.72s)]
*  and that's cool, but [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1440.72s)]
*  if a company that does $100 billion in sales [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1442.72s)]
*  is talking about [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1444.72s)]
*  me and my little company that just started [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1446.72s)]
*  two years ago, basically, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1448.72s)]
*  you know you're fucking with them, and you know they're fucked up. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1450.72s)]
*  That's what's been happening. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1452.72s)]
*  What's the idea of the company? [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1454.72s)]
*  It's really simple. If you ever got a prescription, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1456.72s)]
*  the doctor says, okay, you need X, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1458.72s)]
*  what pharmacy do you use? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1460.72s)]
*  They don't say, can you afford it? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1462.72s)]
*  Here's the cost. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1464.72s)]
*  You find out at the pharmacy, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1466.72s)]
*  or through your insurance company, or whoever pays [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1468.72s)]
*  your co-payer, or whatever. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1470.72s)]
*  So we said, look, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1472.72s)]
*  it's an opaque market. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1474.72s)]
*  There's no transparency whatsoever. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1476.72s)]
*  Because of that, people get ripped off. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1478.72s)]
*  Patients get ripped off, insurance companies [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1480.72s)]
*  rip off companies. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1482.72s)]
*  It's just really fucked up. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1484.72s)]
*  We said, okay, we're going to [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1486.72s)]
*  create this website, costplusdrugs.com. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1488.72s)]
*  You go in there, and you put in the name [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1490.72s)]
*  of the drug, Tadilafil, right? [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1492.72s)]
*  And... [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1494.72s)]
*  I wanted to see if you got it. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1496.72s)]
*  No, I know. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1498.72s)]
*  No, I know. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1500.72s)]
*  There we go. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1502.72s)]
*  I'll do it. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1504.72s)]
*  So now I know what we're talking about. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1506.72s)]
*  Wait, which one is the one that [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1508.72s)]
*  pops up whenever? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1510.72s)]
*  That's Sildenafil? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1512.72s)]
*  No, Sildenafil, right. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1514.72s)]
*  One is the boner whenever you need it, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1516.72s)]
*  and the other is boner now. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1518.72s)]
*  One is Cialis, and one is Viagra. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1520.72s)]
*  Cialis is Tadilafil. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1522.72s)]
*  That's your thing. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1524.72s)]
*  I don't know when you're going to fuck, but you want to do that. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1526.72s)]
*  Let me just tell you this. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1528.72s)]
*  If you go to costplusdrugs.com, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1530.72s)]
*  costplusdrugs.com, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1534.72s)]
*  and you put in Tadilafil, right? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1536.72s)]
*  T-A-D whatever, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1538.72s)]
*  and it comes up, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1540.72s)]
*  it does come up, doesn't it? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1542.72s)]
*  You can get 90 of them, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1544.72s)]
*  90 of them, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1546.72s)]
*  for about $9.90. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1548.72s)]
*  Wow, 10 cents a boner. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1550.72s)]
*  Less than M&M's, right? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1552.72s)]
*  That is crazy. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1554.72s)]
*  Crazy, crazy. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1556.72s)]
*  So you have a choice. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1558.72s)]
*  You can put a little jar of M&M's next to your bed, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1560.72s)]
*  or you can put a little jar of [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1562.72s)]
*  Tadilafil, Sildenafil, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1564.72s)]
*  whatever it is next to your bed, too, right? [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1566.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1568.72s)]
*  The dude abides. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1570.72s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like a no brainer. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1572.72s)]
*  I guess you can only do this with drugs that are, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1574.72s)]
*  what is it called when they're now in the open market? [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1576.72s)]
*  Generics, yeah. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1578.72s)]
*  So we've got a bunch of generics, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1580.72s)]
*  and we've got brands, too, but more generics, right? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1582.72s)]
*  But we can get the price really low [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1584.72s)]
*  on the generics, right? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1586.72s)]
*  Because drugs have like a time... [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1588.72s)]
*  Yeah, you get them for 20 years. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1590.72s)]
*  Okay, so that 20 years includes all the research, too, right? [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1592.72s)]
*  Right, yeah. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1594.72s)]
*  So you research and develop the drug, maybe you have like a five-year window [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1596.72s)]
*  where you can really make your money, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1598.72s)]
*  and then after that, generics pop up. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1600.72s)]
*  Opens up, right? So it goes from $40 a pill [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1602.72s)]
*  down to $0.10 a pill or whatever now. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1604.72s)]
*  Wow. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1606.72s)]
*  And so it's great. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1608.72s)]
*  Yeah, for sure, for sure, for sure. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1610.72s)]
*  But even like, we have like 10% of the market, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1612.72s)]
*  we've only been shipping for two and a half years. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1614.72s)]
*  Wow. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1616.72s)]
*  10% is massive. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1618.72s)]
*  I feel like it's not as big as it should be. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1620.72s)]
*  Oh no, because that's why I'm out there talking about it. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1622.72s)]
*  Because remember, we've only been around two and a half years. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1624.72s)]
*  And you get hems and all that stuff promoting, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1626.72s)]
*  but they're just expensive [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1628.72s)]
*  compared to ours. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1630.72s)]
*  So you just go to the doctor and you say, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1632.72s)]
*  send the prescription to Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drugs, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1634.72s)]
*  and it shows up in his little system, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1636.72s)]
*  and he says, you know, 30, 60, 90, 360, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1638.72s)]
*  whatever you need, you know? [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1640.72s)]
*  And then you see the price, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1642.72s)]
*  and we put it against your credit card, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1644.72s)]

*  Wait, what else are you on? You gotta be on some [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1742.72s)]
*  longevity shit. You're always billionaires who wanna live forever. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1744.72s)]
*  There's no longevity things you do? [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1746.72s)]
*  Cap. Come on. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1748.72s)]
*  Bullshit. So, like, I take the [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1750.72s)]
*  Synthroid and I take a baby [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1752.72s)]
*  aspirin in the morning, drink some water [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1754.72s)]
*  with it. You know, when you get up to pee, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1756.72s)]
*  that's when I take it. And then... [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1758.72s)]
*  I don't mean all that. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1760.72s)]
*  You want to pass, right? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1762.72s)]
*  You want to pass, right? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1764.72s)]
*  I'm not a man, she keeps fucking us. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1766.72s)]
*  And then, you know, I try to go work out. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1768.72s)]
*  And so I take this cardio fitness class, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1770.72s)]
*  right? And then, you know, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1772.72s)]
*  I'll drink this LMNT [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1774.72s)]
*  that's got some sodium in it. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1776.72s)]
*  And I put a little honey in that. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1778.72s)]
*  So you're not on the peptides, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1780.72s)]
*  you're not doing any of this good stuff that all these [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1782.72s)]
*  longevity experts are pushing? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1784.72s)]
*  Like, if I saw some studies that said they worked. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1786.72s)]
*  What about Atiya? That guy... [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1788.72s)]
*  I subscribe to his stuff. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1790.72s)]
*  But at the end of the day, he just busts [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1792.72s)]
*  his ass and works out a lot and watches [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1794.72s)]
*  what he eats. And, you know, so like, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1796.72s)]
*  I use this app called My Fitness Pal, so I write down [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1798.72s)]
*  everything I eat. So I had [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1800.72s)]
*  some caramel popcorn, because I was [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1802.72s)]
*  starving on the way over. And so I'll say [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1804.72s)]
*  120 calories, caramel popcorn, put it in there. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1806.72s)]
*  So as long as I just like watch what I [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1808.72s)]
*  eat and just work out, then I'm cool. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1810.72s)]
*  Hmm. Yeah. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1812.72s)]
*  You work out a lot, though, right? You're like an hour a day. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1814.72s)]
*  Yeah, I try to get my hour in. Yeah. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1816.72s)]
*  Damn, man. I thought you were going to have like [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1818.72s)]
*  some cool Iron Man shit that I had to learn about. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1820.72s)]
*  I wish I did. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1822.72s)]
*  Like, I tried creatine, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1824.72s)]
*  but then I look like a Pillsbury Doughboy. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1826.72s)]
*  Oh, really change your head? Yeah, because [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1828.72s)]
*  you just hold water, right? And then you [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1830.72s)]
*  just get bigger. I get stronger, right? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1832.72s)]
*  But you just blows up. Like, everything [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1834.72s)]
*  blows up. And so I was just [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1836.72s)]
*  what else have I tried? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1838.72s)]
*  You on a test? What about testosterone? [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1840.72s)]
*  No, no, no. Like, I would do [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1842.72s)]
*  HGH if there was something that said [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1844.72s)]
*  it was legal and it worked, but [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1846.72s)]
*  I would do that shit in a heartbeat. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1848.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because it seems [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1850.72s)]
*  like really good when you look at the fighters [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1852.72s)]
*  that use it. Yeah, like, at the [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1854.72s)]
*  Mavs, I probably needed it at 13. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1856.72s)]
*  It'd be fine. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1858.72s)]
*  It's still messy. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1860.72s)]
*  No, I need it now more than ever. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1862.72s)]
*  He really did. They put him on that. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1864.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1866.72s)]
*  They created like a super [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1868.72s)]
*  athlete. Right? Is that [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1870.72s)]
*  why you got the Euros? Because you can start pumping [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1872.72s)]
*  them full of it. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1874.72s)]
*  Dude. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1876.72s)]
*  Oh, here's a good one. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1878.72s)]
*  You guys could have got, and there's [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1880.72s)]
*  so many of these kodas with the NBA teams, but you could [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1882.72s)]
*  have got Yannis. Don't bring that up. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1884.72s)]
*  Is that a hard one? Yeah, yes and no. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1886.72s)]
*  Right? So, this was [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1888.72s)]
*  2013, I think, when he came out. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1890.72s)]
*  Was it? 12 or 13? Yeah, 2012 [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1892.72s)]
*  or 13. Yeah. Okay, yeah. Okay, so [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1894.72s)]
*  you had the what? What pick was it? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1896.72s)]
*  We had like 13, like [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1898.72s)]
*  right outside the lottery, but [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1900.72s)]
*  we also had Caproom and [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1902.72s)]
*  we had Dirk and Dirk was 34 [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1904.72s)]
*  give or take. And we're [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1906.72s)]
*  like, okay, this is like Dirk's [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1908.72s)]
*  end games, right? Yep. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1910.72s)]
*  And so I wanted to try to get a free agent [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1912.72s)]
*  so that we could cook it. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1914.72s)]
*  Give him one more shot. Yeah, at least, right? [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1916.72s)]
*  And so I remember [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1918.72s)]
*  looking at the tapes of Yannis [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1920.72s)]
*  and all we had were two VHS tapes [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1922.72s)]
*  of him playing in the shitty [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1924.72s)]
*  little Greek league. Yeah. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1926.72s)]
*  You know, he got drafted what? [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1928.72s)]
*  13, 14, 15? Yeah. But the GM [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1930.72s)]
*  at the time was high on him, right? No, very [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1932.72s)]
*  much so. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1934.72s)]
*  Carlisle was a Virginia boy, so he [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1936.72s)]
*  like Larkin and there was something. No, it wasn't even [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1938.72s)]
*  that. Shane was cool. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1940.72s)]
*  And we all liked him, but we [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1942.72s)]
*  just traded down just to save money [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1944.72s)]
*  for Caproom. Yeah, if Yannis lasted to that pick, they'd have picked him. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1946.72s)]
*  Yeah, we would have picked him. Yeah. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1948.72s)]
*  Yannis went 15, then we had 18. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1950.72s)]
*  They had 13 trade backs [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1952.72s)]
*  to save money. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1954.72s)]
*  So there's 14 other teams that passed on him too. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1956.72s)]
*  Of course, but they're not sitting right here. Yeah, that's true. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1958.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? But I mean, listen, you guys [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1960.72s)]
*  did okay. It turned out [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1962.72s)]
*  alright. But if we had gotten Yannis, we [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1964.72s)]
*  wouldn't have gotten Luca. Luca's now younger. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1966.72s)]
*  Yeah. Okay, let's [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1968.72s)]
*  rile up NBA Twitter. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1970.72s)]
*  Luca or Dirk? [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1972.72s)]
*  Well, Luca's a better player. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1974.72s)]
*  Damn, bro. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1976.72s)]
*  Dirk said that like his rookie year. Dirk [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1978.72s)]
*  was like, this kid's better than I'll ever be. Dirk [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1980.72s)]
*  is amazing. He's the [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1982.72s)]
*  all-time best MAV. Yeah. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1984.72s)]
*  Just because we've won a championship with him and who he [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1986.72s)]
*  is and what he did for the organization. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1988.72s)]
*  But Luca can bring the ball up. Dirk, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1990.72s)]
*  you needed to get him the ball. Yeah. You know, and then [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1992.72s)]
*  he could go and do what he needed to do. Yeah. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1994.72s)]
*  With Luca, you just [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1996.72s)]
*  inbound the ball to him and [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=1998.72s)]
*  he just does the rest. He's insane. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2000.72s)]
*  Yeah, he is insane. But if you had to pick one? [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2002.72s)]
*  Like if I had to start a team, I'd [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2004.72s)]
*  start it with Luca. Wow. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2006.72s)]
*  My second pick would be Dirk, of course. But [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2008.72s)]
*  damn. Yeah. And I've said that to Dirk. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2010.72s)]
*  What does he say? He punched me. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2012.72s)]
*  I mean, Dirk is just [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2016.72s)]
*  a badass dude. Oh, dude. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2018.72s)]
*  He is such a good guy. Such a good guy. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2020.72s)]
*  But I am 1-0 against him in one-on-one. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2022.72s)]
*  Wait, how did you beat him in one-on-one? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2024.72s)]
*  It was contract year. Nah, it was at Till [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2026.72s)]
*  Danifield. My first year when I first [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2028.72s)]
*  popped the team. You popped a couple Till Danifields. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2030.72s)]
*  He's insane. Garney! [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2032.72s)]
*  Garney! Garney! [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2034.72s)]
*  Post up on this. Okay. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2036.72s)]
*  No, literally. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2038.72s)]
*  So we were like [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2040.72s)]
*  I just bought the team and I was out there [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2042.72s)]
*  shooting with the guys and I [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2044.72s)]
*  was like, let's play one-on-one. And so I get the ball [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2046.72s)]
*  out first. And he's not really guarding me, but [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2048.7200000000003s)]
*  he's just, you know, and like hit a jumper. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2050.7200000000003s)]
*  Boom. Hit. Okay. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2052.7200000000003s)]
*  And you're like fake, lay up. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2054.7200000000003s)]
*  Next one blocks the shit out of it. His ball. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2056.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm up 2-0. Yeah. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2058.72s)]
*  He goes by me. Bam! [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2060.72s)]
*  On my head. I'm like, I quit. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2062.72s)]
*  So 2-1. I win. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2064.72s)]
*  I have a, I can ask you so many [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2066.72s)]
*  questions about basketball. I remember [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2068.72s)]
*  being in Dallas when you bought the team. We didn't really know [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2070.72s)]
*  who you were. This billionaire is buying the team. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2072.72s)]
*  There weren't that many billionaires back then. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2074.72s)]
*  And the Mavs were historically [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2076.72s)]
*  bad in the 90s. Awful. As soon as [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2078.72s)]
*  you buy them, within a month, they [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2080.72s)]
*  almost made the playoffs. Next year they made the playoffs. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2082.72s)]
*  Made the playoffs, what, 12, 15 straight years, whatever it was. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2084.72s)]
*  Did you do anything right when you got there? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2086.72s)]
*  What was it about your arrival? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2088.72s)]
*  I just walked in the door and I said, shit's going to change. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2090.72s)]
*  You know, we're going to try to win or you're [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2092.72s)]
*  gone. If you're not into just working your [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2094.72s)]
*  ass off and winning, you're not going to [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2096.72s)]
*  stick around, so tell me now. And [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2098.72s)]
*  I upgraded [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2100.72s)]
*  stuff like [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2102.72s)]
*  the first meeting I had with [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2104.72s)]
*  the team, there was a guy on the team named Gary [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2106.72s)]
*  Trent. And Gary Trent Jr. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2108.72s)]
*  is his son. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2110.72s)]
*  And he goes, Mark, we go to [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2112.72s)]
*  places like Oakland, California, we get there [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2114.72s)]
*  at 2 in the morning and [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2116.72s)]
*  we stay at these shitty hotels that don't have room [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2118.72s)]
*  service. So now we're walking through [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2120.72s)]
*  Oakland, California, looking for a 7-11 [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2122.72s)]
*  to get something. And I'm like, no, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2124.72s)]
*  that's not right. So we upgraded the [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2126.72s)]
*  Four Seasons, upgraded the plane, did all [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2128.72s)]
*  this shit. And we upgraded the locker room. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2130.72s)]
*  Yeah, and so [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2132.72s)]
*  it was, okay, I'm [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2134.72s)]
*  doing my part. So you guys better step up. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2136.72s)]
*  Yeah. And so we brought in like [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2138.72s)]
*  coaches, player [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2140.72s)]
*  development coaches. Like back then, there were [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2142.72s)]
*  four coaches. There was a head coach, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2144.72s)]
*  a few assistant coaches. And when the guys [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2146.72s)]
*  wanted to work on their skills, you brought [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2148.72s)]
*  in one of the assistant coaches. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2150.72s)]
*  I'm like, this is ridiculous. We literally spent more [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2152.72s)]
*  money on training on PCs [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2154.72s)]
*  than we did for player development. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2156.72s)]
*  So I'm like, I told our coach, Nellie, I'm like, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2158.72s)]
*  go find some former Mavs, get [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2160.72s)]
*  15 of them, one for everybody. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2162.72s)]
*  And literally, that's what we did. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2164.72s)]
*  And so now every team has got [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2166.72s)]
*  player development coaches out the ass. And [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2168.72s)]
*  that was all because back then we sucked so bad. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2170.72s)]
*  And I had to send the message, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2172.72s)]
*  we're going to play to win. Speaking of [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2174.72s)]
*  the NBA, obviously, you know, this [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2176.72s)]
*  NBA season, Nick's guaranteed, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2178.72s)]
*  guaranteed to win a championship [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2180.72s)]
*  with the new [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2182.72s)]
*  edition, big purr. Now you actually [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2184.72s)]
*  look good. Yeah, I think that's a good trade. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2186.72s)]
*  I hate to say it. Shout out A-Rod, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2188.72s)]
*  still working for us. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2190.72s)]
*  Once a Yankee, always a Yankee. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2192.72s)]
*  So A-Rod owns the Timberwolves. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2194.72s)]
*  And he made sure that trade went to him. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2196.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? I know. I know. Shout out the Timberwolves for being broke. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2198.72s)]
*  We appreciate y'all. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2200.72s)]
*  You know, for not having enough money to keep your players. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2202.72s)]
*  And no, we got a nice little situation [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2204.72s)]
*  going. We do. We do. I hate to admit it. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2206.72s)]
*  I like it. I like it a lot. Anyway, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2208.72s)]
*  if you're gambling, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2210.72s)]
*  obviously, you're going to do it with [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2212.72s)]
*  Stake. Stake has got your back. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2214.72s)]
*  They are the sponsor of this [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2216.72s)]
*  podcast. So that's the one that we're rocking with. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2218.72s)]
*  Okay? And we know we're [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2220.72s)]
*  putting the house on the Knicks. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2222.72s)]
*  We are putting the house [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2224.72s)]
*  on the Knicks. I don't even believe that. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2226.72s)]
*  I don't even believe that as [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2228.72s)]
*  I'm saying it. I am not [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2230.72s)]
*  betting shit on the Knicks. I got to see this chemistry [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2232.72s)]
*  first. I'll put a rent controlled apartment [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2234.72s)]
*  on the Knicks, maybe. At best. Shit. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2236.72s)]
*  Like a month? Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2238.72s)]
*  A month of rent? Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2240.72s)]
*  Rent controlled apartment in New [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2242.72s)]
*  York. It's a valuable [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2244.72s)]
*  asset right there. Anyway, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2246.72s)]
*  what are you thinking? What are you thinking this season? Are we [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2248.72s)]
*  just going to go with who's going to win the NBA [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2250.72s)]
*  championship right now? Okay. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2252.72s)]
*  I'm down for that. Okay, what would you say? The Celtics [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2254.72s)]
*  still look fucking good, but the team that's best [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2256.72s)]
*  built to beat them is probably the Knicks. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2258.72s)]
*  I don't know if the Knicks could win at all. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2260.72s)]
*  I don't think the Celtics could win with [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2262.72s)]
*  what's it called? Jalen [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2264.72s)]
*  Brown's new sneakers. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2266.72s)]
*  Like he started his own sneaker company. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2268.72s)]
*  Which is never a good move. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2270.72s)]
*  It's never a winning move. Yeah, and you know, shout out [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2272.72s)]
*  to Jalen Brown. He's an incredibly talented [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2274.72s)]
*  player. I hate this. I think [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2276.72s)]
*  y'all could make it out of the East very easily. Yeah, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2278.72s)]
*  I think we're definitely making it out of the East. Chris Middleton [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2280.72s)]
*  is hurt, so the Bucs are done. Yeah. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2282.72s)]
*  I wasn't even worried about the Bucs in the [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2284.72s)]
*  first place. Boston, that's the only [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2286.72s)]
*  real threat. Miami's not going to do it. You can't start your own [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2288.72s)]
*  sneaker company. It's never [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2290.72s)]
*  can we gamble on that? [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2292.72s)]
*  How do we gamble on that [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2294.72s)]
*  if the sneaker company is going to work? Sneaker going to blow up like one of [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2296.72s)]
*  Zion's? Like a hair Zion's? Exactly. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2298.72s)]
*  Exactly. Doug, I hate this. I think [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2300.72s)]
*  y'all might make it to the finals. I think [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2302.72s)]
*  Zion sneakers were made by the Israeli [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2304.72s)]
*  defense force. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2306.72s)]
*  I think [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2308.72s)]
*  the air has blown us. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2310.72s)]
*  I think they got them [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2312.72s)]
*  sneakers at the same place they got those pagers. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2314.72s)]
*  I think that's what happens. Anyway, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2316.72s)]
*  so Steak, you're putting [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2318.72s)]

*  the show. Is there ever a PR machine [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2332.72s)]
*  behind what you do or [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2334.72s)]
*  do you just try to make the splash as big as [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2336.72s)]
*  possible and then the conversation begins? [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2338.72s)]
*  I just try to do it right because like [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2340.72s)]
*  back then particularly there was a bunch [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2342.72s)]
*  of old motherfuckers that owned teams. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2344.72s)]
*  They inherited them or won them in a [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2346.72s)]
*  poker game. Anytime I spent money [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2348.72s)]
*  they would be pissed at me. I remember [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2350.72s)]
*  one time I was in a board of governors meeting [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2352.72s)]
*  and the owner of one of the teams, I won't [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2354.72s)]
*  name drop. I'll guess. Yeah. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2356.72s)]
*  He's dead now. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2358.72s)]
*  Donald Sterling. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2360.72s)]
*  That's all. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2362.72s)]
*  We want to hear [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2364.72s)]
*  about that. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2366.72s)]
*  Correct. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2368.72s)]
*  You let them take pictures with your wife? [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2370.72s)]

*  you do something in the NBA just sit down and shut [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2384.72s)]
*  the fuck up. And then [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2386.72s)]
*  I'm like okay Abe. His name [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2388.72s)]
*  wasn't Abe. I got the name wrong but [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2390.72s)]
*  yeah. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2392.72s)]
*  I mean they just fucked with me the whole time. But [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2394.72s)]
*  to his credit even though he would find me all the time [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2396.72s)]
*  it was okay you're helping [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2398.72s)]
*  the league. You're doing stuff. You're getting things rolling. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2400.72s)]
*  I was kind of like the tech guy. You were very much [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2402.72s)]
*  a disruptor. Oh for sure. I just didn't care. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2404.72s)]

*  now. Yeah. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2408.72s)]
*  Democratic shill dude. I knew it. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2410.72s)]
*  I'm not even a Democrat. I don't know why people [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2412.72s)]
*  say that shit. Yeah boy! [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2414.72s)]
*  Tug that nut. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2416.72s)]
*  So I heard you say this. I think [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2418.72s)]
*  I like to think I'm independent. I believe you're truly [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2420.72s)]
*  independent. You said if there was a non-magic [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2422.72s)]
*  Republican in 2020 you would have voted for them. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2424.72s)]
*  Who do you see on that side that you're like [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2426.72s)]
*  I would like for them to be president? [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2428.72s)]
*  I like Nikki Haley. I voted for her [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2430.72s)]
*  in the primary. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2432.72s)]
*  I like Chris Christie. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2434.72s)]
*  Because he talks shit and doesn't give a shit. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2436.72s)]
*  I wasn't [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2438.72s)]

*  now but I think he's great. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2444.72s)]
*  Yeah I think he's just a Trump with a better [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2446.72s)]
*  vocabulary. He's got a great [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2448.72s)]
*  vocabulary. He's got a great vocabulary. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2450.72s)]
*  He's really smart. He hates bureaucracy. He's [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2452.72s)]
*  very smart. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2454.72s)]
*  What I appreciate about [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2456.72s)]
*  Vivek is that he knows what he's [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2458.72s)]
*  suggesting is radical. And he's like [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2460.72s)]
*  that this is a government of the [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2462.72s)]
*  people and we deserve the situation [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2464.72s)]
*  we put ourselves in. So like I did a podcast [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2466.72s)]
*  with him. Yeah I saw that. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2468.72s)]
*  And when he suggests it, it's one [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2470.72s)]
*  thing to suggest it but it's not [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2472.72s)]
*  problem solving. You can say I'm [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2474.72s)]
*  going to cut out the Department of Education. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2476.72s)]
*  That sounds really good. Well we didn't have a Department [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2478.72s)]
*  of Education in 1817 [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2480.72s)]
*  and it wasn't meant to be this [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2482.72s)]
*  big. But we are where we are. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2484.72s)]
*  You know? And [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2486.72s)]
*  if you're going to fix something, if you want it better [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2488.72s)]
*  you have to be able to go from where [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2490.72s)]
*  you are to where you want to get [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2492.72s)]
*  to. And so if you want to [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2494.72s)]
*  change education, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2496.72s)]
*  where you are, okay let's talk about how [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2498.72s)]
*  you're going to get there. You want to cut the size [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2500.72s)]
*  of government? Great I want to cut the size of government [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2502.72s)]
*  and make it more efficient. Let's talk about AI [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2504.72s)]
*  as a service. How can we use AI to speed up [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2506.72s)]
*  different functions that [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2508.72s)]
*  the government does now so it's not just [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2510.72s)]
*  a bunch of people sitting at desks. There's [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2512.72s)]
*  a million ways to do it and [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2514.72s)]
*  that's the shit I can talk to the Harris campaign about [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2516.72s)]
*  when I talk to Vivek or whoever [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2518.72s)]
*  Republicans. They're not talking about [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2520.72s)]
*  that shit. So can you explain [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2522.72s)]
*  to just a regular person like myself [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2524.72s)]
*  when [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2526.72s)]
*  people talk about how bloated [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2528.72s)]
*  government is, how does that happen? [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2530.72s)]
*  And then what would you do to [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2532.72s)]
*  contract it? So it's a great question. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2534.72s)]
*  So it happens a couple different ways. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2536.72s)]
*  Congress passes different [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2538.72s)]
*  programs and they put [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2540.72s)]
*  together these programs and then you have, they [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2542.72s)]
*  assign money to it and then they [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2544.72s)]
*  get implemented. Well intentioned [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2546.72s)]
*  programs? Yeah well intentioned. Or are they being lobbied to? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2548.72s)]
*  All the above. So maybe [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2550.72s)]
*  not all, some might be a bridge to [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2552.72s)]
*  nowhere type thing. But for the most part [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2554.72s)]
*  they're well intentioned. They had a program in [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2556.72s)]
*  mind, they had somebody, a constituency [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2558.72s)]
*  they were trying to help and then [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2560.72s)]
*  they implement them. And then that's [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2562.72s)]
*  one program and then there's another [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2564.72s)]
*  program over here. Oh and they're [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2566.72s)]
*  job, oh they're defined by how [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2568.72s)]
*  many of these things they pass. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2570.72s)]
*  It's not even that, it's just they all had good intentions but over [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2572.72s)]
*  40 years [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2574.72s)]
*  they don't go away. They don't go away. There's 40 [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2576.72s)]
*  different programs and so then you [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2578.72s)]
*  have to have people who manage the people then interconnect [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2580.72s)]
*  them, that deal with [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2582.72s)]
*  the output of them. This is interesting. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2584.72s)]
*  So rather there's [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2586.72s)]
*  just, you can't just say cut them all because [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2588.72s)]
*  the more programs you have the more people it takes [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2590.72s)]
*  to make sure that they're interconnected. They all work together [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2592.72s)]
*  and track all the money and do all the [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2594.72s)]
*  stuff and get the money there, get the money out, pay [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2596.72s)]
*  for it, talk about it, do the budget for it. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2598.72s)]
*  But you can't just say you're gone [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2600.72s)]
*  because there are contracts and shit. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2602.72s)]
*  And there's companies that literally are [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2604.72s)]
*  run by hardworking American entrepreneurs [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2606.72s)]
*  that have contracts [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2608.72s)]
*  with those organizations, those [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2610.72s)]
*  projects. And so when you're just [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2612.72s)]
*  saying, okay I'm just cutting the entire [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2614.72s)]
*  department of education. Yeah, it's [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2616.72s)]
*  But if you say, okay, as [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2618.72s)]
*  we're going to walk in and [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2620.72s)]
*  we're going to use technology [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2622.72s)]
*  and we're going to say, this program [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2624.72s)]
*  here, we're going to make you more efficient [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2626.72s)]
*  so when someone retires or dies [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2628.72s)]
*  you don't have to replace that position. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2630.72s)]
*  But the goal [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2632.72s)]
*  is to help kids. It's a [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2634.72s)]
*  school lunch program [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2636.72s)]
*  and to help kids, we don't want the kids [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2638.72s)]
*  to get less because this whole thing gets cut [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2640.72s)]
*  because what Vivek would say is, we're just going [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2642.72s)]
*  to cut it and send the money to the states. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2644.72s)]
*  But then the states do the same shit. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2646.72s)]
*  They also have their program. Yeah, they do the exact same thing. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2648.72s)]
*  And they're going to have the same bloating. The same problem. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2650.72s)]
*  But then it's on them. What I say [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2652.72s)]
*  is, okay, the goal is to get the kids fed. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2654.72s)]
*  If we can find a better way [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2656.72s)]
*  to sunset this [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2658.72s)]
*  program but make sure those kids are [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2660.72s)]
*  in a better position, because [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2662.72s)]
*  it may even be better just to write them all [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2664.72s)]
*  checks. Or give the parents [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2666.72s)]
*  checks and make it cheaper. You don't [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2668.72s)]
*  know, but the goal is, find a solution. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2670.72s)]
*  Fix a problem. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2672.72s)]
*  It seems like what you're describing could be like a [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2674.72s)]
*  10 or 20 year [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2676.72s)]
*  turnaround for a lot of these programs. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2678.72s)]
*  How do you make sure that [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2680.72s)]
*  five administrations potentially [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2682.72s)]
*  continue it? You don't. That's the problem. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2684.72s)]
*  That's part of the issue. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2686.72s)]
*  Democrats have their programs, Republicans [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2688.72s)]
*  have their programs. And that's where you hope like [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2690.72s)]
*  an independent who's not part of that. Like if it [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2692.72s)]
*  were up to me, I would love both parties to just get the [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2694.72s)]
*  fuck out. What the fuck do we need them [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2696.72s)]
*  for? They're there to raise money and to [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2698.72s)]
*  create problems. And now, Trump, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2700.72s)]
*  there is no real Republican party. That's like the family [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2702.72s)]
*  business. Trump runs it. And Kamala is doing [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2704.72s)]
*  the same thing on the Democratic side. It's not [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2706.72s)]
*  like you hear anything from Bernie Sanders [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2708.72s)]
*  or Elizabeth Warren anymore. They're out in the [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2710.72s)]
*  shitter. And Kamala [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2712.72s)]
*  learned from Trump. Literally, she learned from [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2714.72s)]
*  Trump. She's like, Donald [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2716.72s)]
*  took over this program. I'm going to [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2718.72s)]
*  do the same thing with the Democrats. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2720.72s)]
*  And this is what I care about. This is [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2722.72s)]
*  what I'm going to do. Doesn't matter what [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2724.72s)]
*  Bernie or Elizabeth or those guys want to do. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2726.72s)]
*  So you're not seeing her. There's not dissenting [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2728.72s)]
*  voices even within the party. No, it's just like you don't [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2730.72s)]
*  on Trump, right? Everybody falls in line. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2732.72s)]
*  Everybody falls in line on both sides. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2734.72s)]
*  That's what it takes now. It's more about the personality [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2736.72s)]
*  and who's going out there getting votes [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2738.72s)]
*  than it is about the programs. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2740.72s)]

*  But Clinton was fun too. He played saxophone. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2762.72s)]
*  He played saxophone. That's cool. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2764.72s)]

*  Abraham Lincoln was fun. He knew how to make room under his desk. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2768.72s)]

*  I'll just watch and enjoy. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2792.72s)]
*  He was smoking a cigar, yelling [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2794.72s)]
*  at the TV the entire [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2796.72s)]
*  game. I was like, let's go. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2798.72s)]
*  He was mad. He was Hillary, right? [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2800.72s)]
*  Anyways. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2806.72s)]
*  Good guy, right? Yeah, he's a good guy. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2808.72s)]
*  Who am I to love? Bill. Bill's a [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2810.72s)]
*  beast. He's smart as fuck too. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2812.72s)]
*  When you talk to him about any topic, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2814.72s)]
*  he knows what he's talking about. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2816.72s)]
*  Great communicator. I've noticed [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2818.72s)]
*  a lot of times he communicates through story. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2820.72s)]
*  It's effortless. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2822.72s)]
*  What do you think about the environment? [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2824.72s)]
*  One time in Arkansas, and all of a sudden [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2826.72s)]
*  you're kind of caught up in this thing that [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2828.72s)]
*  at the end of the story kind of proves his point [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2830.72s)]
*  about how we should handle the environment. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2832.72s)]
*  For better or worse, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2834.72s)]
*  even Kamala doesn't do a good job of that. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2836.72s)]
*  She needs [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2838.72s)]
*  a windup to get into her stories. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2840.72s)]
*  Trump just talks whatever. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2842.72s)]
*  He has [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2844.72s)]
*  his go-to sayings. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2846.72s)]
*  I was the biggest, the best, the this, [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2848.72s)]
*  this is the best, whatever. He just always goes. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2850.72s)]
*  That's kind of his protected [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2852.72s)]
*  place. He goes into his [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2854.72s)]
*  catchphrases, and that's where [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2856.72s)]
*  he just builds off. Do you want a catchphrase? [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2858.72s)]
*  Be honest. Do you want one from him? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2860.72s)]
*  From him? Yeah. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2862.72s)]
*  I don't know, but would it be a flattering [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2864.72s)]
*  thing that you got a catchphrase from Trump? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2866.72s)]
*  He's fucked with me. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2868.72s)]
*  Yeah, but, no, what did he say? [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2870.72s)]
*  Oh, he did say like, [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2872.72s)]
*  oh my god, we did this [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2874.72s)]
*  MMA thing, and [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2876.72s)]
*  I couldn't find it. Someone had sent it to me, and I couldn't [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2878.72s)]
*  find it. We did this MMA thing back in [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2880.72s)]
*  2007, where I had a [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2882.72s)]
*  TV network, HDNet, and we put on MMA [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2884.72s)]
*  fights, and he did something [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2886.72s)]
*  with the Russians, this guy [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2888.72s)]
*  named [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2890.72s)]
*  Fedor. And so, [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2892.72s)]
*  Elia Menko? Yeah, Elia Menko. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2894.72s)]
*  The time was like, no, badass, right? [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2896.72s)]
*  Oh, and I did Vodkaschov with the dude, man. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2898.72s)]
*  He could put it away. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2900.72s)]
*  And then Josh, not Lambert, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2902.72s)]
*  what the fuck was it? Barrett. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2904.72s)]
*  But in any event, so [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2906.72s)]
*  the fight, for a lot of reasons, didn't ever happen, [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2908.72s)]
*  but he said, I'm doing [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2910.72s)]
*  this with Mark Cuban, because everything he touches turns to gold. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2912.72s)]
*  And so he gave it [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2914.72s)]
*  to him, and I said nice things about him, because [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2916.72s)]
*  there was no, why not, right? [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2918.72s)]
*  But shit changes [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2920.72s)]
*  over time. As you got to know him, you [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2922.72s)]
*  felt he was... I just, I don't [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2924.72s)]
*  have a problem with him as a person, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2926.72s)]
*  just, like you were just talking about [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2928.72s)]
*  Bill Clinton, telling the story, get to the point, [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2930.72s)]
*  and you knew what the point was. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2932.72s)]
*  Have you ever seen that happen with Donald [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2934.72s)]
*  Trump? When he starts a story, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2936.72s)]
*  he gets the end of it? Where you understand, he said [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2938.72s)]
*  that was nuanced, that really he [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2940.72s)]
*  had some in-depth understanding. No, but like, [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2942.72s)]
*  there are some people that [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2944.72s)]
*  are funny when they're not trying to be funny, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2946.72s)]
*  and he is one of them. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2948.72s)]
*  And that's exactly what we want for president, right? [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2950.72s)]
*  No, no, here's the thing, [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2952.72s)]
*  that is, you're assuming [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2954.72s)]
*  that we make the best [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2956.72s)]
*  decisions when it comes to electing [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2958.72s)]
*  people, right? And I think we elect people [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2960.72s)]
*  emotionally. And I know it's absurd to be like [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2962.72s)]
*  this guy's funny. I'm not disagreeing with you at all. But it was [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2964.72s)]
*  absurd that we saw Bill Clinton [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2966.72s)]
*  play saxophone shitty on Arsenio Hall, and we were like, [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2968.72s)]
*  this guy's cool, right? Like [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2970.72s)]
*  that's also an absurd thing. But [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2972.72s)]
*  it worked, you know? And [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2974.72s)]
*  so I think that, I think [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2976.72s)]
*  most Americans really kind [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2978.72s)]
*  of know nothing about the laws that are being passed. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2980.72s)]
*  They're worried about obviously their communities, [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2982.72s)]
*  and they want to vote for someone [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2984.72s)]
*  who makes them feel like their, you [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2986.72s)]
*  know, concerns are going to be considered. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2988.72s)]
*  Or that it's just a fuck you. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2990.72s)]
*  Dude. Yeah. I think [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2992.72s)]
*  the majority of people might [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2994.72s)]
*  vote as a fuck you to the other party. Yeah, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2996.72s)]
*  for sure. Like if you just sit right here and [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=2998.72s)]
*  you go, I'm a Democrat, half of the country goes, that [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3000.72s)]
*  guy's fucking on it. And the other half [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3002.72s)]
*  goes, fuck you. Yeah, yeah, you're [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3004.72s)]
*  out. And which is interesting because I imagine [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3006.72s)]
*  it's kind of vulnerable as a politician [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3008.72s)]
*  when you want to speak the truth, but [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3010.72s)]
*  you know that people don't really like [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3012.72s)]
*  you. They like you as a representative [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3014.72s)]
*  of the party. You're almost like an actor [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3016.72s)]
*  who plays a popular character on a show. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3018.72s)]
*  They don't really like the man. I had someone say that to me [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3020.72s)]
*  yesterday. Look, he's an idiot, but I'm [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3022.72s)]
*  a Republican. Wait, wait, meaning [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3024.72s)]
*  Trump. Trump is an idiot, but I'm a Republican. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3026.72s)]
*  So I gotta vote for the guy. And to your earlier [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3028.72s)]
*  point, I think there were people in 2016 that was like, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3030.72s)]
*  I don't care about him, but I love how much Democrats hate [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3032.72s)]
*  him. Yeah, yeah, for sure. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3034.72s)]
*  You'd spoken about this before. They had felt so [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3036.72s)]
*  like maligned for years. Yeah, like, you know, [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3038.72s)]
*  they felt made fun of and teased. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3040.72s)]
*  They're like, finally somebody is punching them [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3042.72s)]
*  back to them. Fuck them. And I get that. I get that [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3044.72s)]
*  for sure. For sure. Right. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3046.72s)]
*  But, you know, and I can see [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3048.72s)]
*  how you pick Donald Trump to [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3050.72s)]
*  be that. But oh my [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3052.72s)]
*  God, he's talking about the presidency. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3054.72s)]
*  Yeah. So giving you an opportunity to speak on [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3056.72s)]
*  some stuff you mentioned, what would you say to [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3058.72s)]
*  a Trump supporter who's like [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3060.72s)]
*  the country was better off under Trump [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3062.72s)]
*  than it was under Biden? [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3064.72s)]
*  Those four years with Biden, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3066.72s)]
*  everything got worse. Four years Trump had [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3068.72s)]
*  stayed the same or got better. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3070.72s)]
*  Even if he inherited something good from Obama. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3072.72s)]
*  It's not the truth, but I understand why they [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3074.72s)]
*  say that. I want you to [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3076.72s)]
*  dispel these things. I mean, I can tell you [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3078.72s)]
*  no wars. There was a war [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3080.72s)]
*  in Yemen where hundreds of thousands of people died, [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3082.72s)]
*  or at least a hundred thousand plus people died. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3084.72s)]
*  And he had a chance to say no, we're going to get out. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3086.72s)]
*  He said, yes, we're going to keep on [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3088.72s)]
*  selling them, selling [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3090.72s)]
*  weapons to Saudi Arabia. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3092.72s)]
*  So when he says no wars, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3094.72s)]
*  that's bullshit. When he [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3096.72s)]
*  says he's pro-military, there were 200 [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3098.72s)]
*  soldiers that got bombed [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3100.72s)]
*  to shit. And I forget if it was [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3102.72s)]
*  Iraq or Syria. And [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3104.72s)]
*  a bunch of them had traumatic brain injuries. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3106.72s)]
*  He came out and said [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3108.72s)]
*  there were headaches. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3110.72s)]
*  When Puerto [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3112.72s)]
*  Rico got hit with a hurricane, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3114.72s)]
*  he held back. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3116.72s)]
*  That was funny with the toilet paper. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3118.72s)]
*  It was funny when he finally got down there. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3120.72s)]
*  But still, he held back money. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3122.72s)]
*  He withheld aid. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3124.72s)]
*  When the hurricane was sweeping [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3126.72s)]
*  through the southeast, he redrew a fucking [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3128.72s)]
*  map to make it look like it was going to go [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3130.72s)]
*  through Alabama. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3132.72s)]
*  So inflation. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3134.72s)]
*  So there was a point in time, because [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3136.72s)]
*  I'm just reading about this, in 2020, [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3138.72s)]
*  right as the pandemic was starting, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3140.72s)]
*  and because there was [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3142.72s)]
*  a lot of the demand for oil and gas [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3144.72s)]
*  was falling, [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3146.72s)]
*  Russia and Saudi [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3148.72s)]
*  Arabia got into a price war [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3150.72s)]
*  on oil. And the price of gas just [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3152.72s)]
*  plummeted. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3154.72s)]
*  And a bunch of the people in the oil [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3156.72s)]
*  industry went to Donald Trump and said [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3158.72s)]
*  you know MBS at Saudi Arabia, [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3160.72s)]
*  you know Putin, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3162.72s)]
*  for better or worse, get them [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3164.72s)]
*  together and let's [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3166.72s)]
*  reduce production so the [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3168.72s)]
*  price of oil goes up. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3170.72s)]
*  Now, here's the bargain. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3172.72s)]
*  Do you save the oil companies? [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3174.72s)]
*  Or do you motherfucking save all the people [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3176.72s)]
*  who are suffering from the pandemic and want [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3178.72s)]
*  to pay less for gas? [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3180.72s)]
*  And if you track [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3182.72s)]
*  it, the reduction in [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3184.72s)]
*  production of [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3186.72s)]
*  oil, they pulled back so [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3188.72s)]
*  much so that the price went up. And then [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3190.72s)]
*  over time, over the following two years, so that [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3192.72s)]
*  was from early 2020 to [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3194.72s)]
*  late 2022, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3196.72s)]
*  they increased production. And when [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3198.72s)]
*  you increase production, the [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3200.72s)]
*  price of gas goes back down [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3202.72s)]
*  some. So when they were reducing production, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3204.72s)]
*  the price of gas went like this. And that was the [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3206.72s)]
*  start of inflation. Because just like [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3208.72s)]
*  he says all the time, you know, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3210.72s)]
*  drill, drill, drill, because [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3212.72s)]
*  that'll reduce the prices of everything else. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3214.72s)]
*  Well, he literally caused the prices [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3216.72s)]
*  of everything else to start going [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3218.72s)]
*  up. So by the time he left, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3220.72s)]
*  the price of oil is expensive. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3222.72s)]
*  The shipping is more expensive. Everything [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3224.72s)]
*  is more. It's a trickle down effect from oil. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3226.72s)]
*  And so it went from, he made the choice, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3228.72s)]
*  I pay my boys that run these [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3230.72s)]
*  oil companies, or I keep [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3232.72s)]
*  the price of oil and gas low. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3234.72s)]
*  So our gas price is for everybody [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3236.72s)]
*  else. Now question about [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3238.72s)]
*  I keep on going. No, no, no. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3240.72s)]
*  This is why I'm asking you for specifics. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3242.72s)]
*  Because I'm listening to all these, we're doing research, I'm listening [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3244.72s)]
*  to all these things, and you just keep having [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3246.72s)]
*  great answers for everything. But then I start to go, [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3248.72s)]
*  is he right or is he just [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3250.72s)]
*  really fucking good at debating? And that's why I'm [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3252.72s)]
*  asking you for specifics. Because I think a lot of people [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3254.72s)]
*  might be like, yeah, he sounds right, but he's [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3256.72s)]
*  just so smart. I don't know if he's actually right. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3258.72s)]
*  With Trump? You. Oh me? When you're talking about [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3260.72s)]
*  anti Trump this, anti Trump that. Oh no, I'm just giving you, look, [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3262.72s)]
*  I'm not the expert in all this shit, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3264.72s)]
*  and somebody can tell me I'm wrong, [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3266.72s)]
*  that's fine, I'll learn from it. But [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3268.72s)]
*  you don't see Donald [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3270.72s)]
*  Trump admitting to anything. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3272.72s)]
*  Nothing. When was the one time [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3274.72s)]
*  he ever said I'm wrong? When was [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3276.72s)]
*  the one time he said, okay, let me figure [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3278.72s)]
*  this out, let me give you some details. Maybe [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3280.72s)]
*  that's why I like him, because he's like my wife. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3282.72s)]
*  Bingo! [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3284.72s)]
*  There you go. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3286.72s)]
*  He's like, ah, you. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3288.72s)]
*  You're like, why? [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3290.72s)]
*  Why is he like me? [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3292.72s)]
*  Break down tariffs, because [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3296.72s)]
*  from his side he says, [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3298.72s)]
*  oh, I'm just hard on China. The dumbest [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3300.72s)]
*  shit ever! [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3302.72s)]
*  Okay, alright. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3304.72s)]
*  Let's talk tariffs, right? [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3306.72s)]
*  There's two types of tariffs. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3308.72s)]
*  There's strategic tariffs, and [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3310.72s)]
*  there's across the board tariffs. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3312.72s)]
*  Strategic tariffs are, you're Japan, [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3314.72s)]
*  or you're China, and [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3316.72s)]
*  you own part of the steel company [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3318.72s)]
*  in your country. China [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3320.72s)]
*  is an owner. It's a nationalized company. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3322.72s)]
*  It's a nationalized company. So, they [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3324.72s)]
*  can say, we're going to undercut the [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3326.72s)]
*  price of steel made by US Steel [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3328.72s)]
*  in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. So, we're [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3330.72s)]
*  going to ship it in at a really reduced [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3332.72s)]
*  price, so that we could take business [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3334.72s)]
*  away from US Steel. Their business [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3336.72s)]
*  shrinks, and now if the United [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3338.72s)]
*  States... Oh, at a loss to the company [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3340.72s)]
*  that's in China, because it's nationalized, it's at a [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3342.72s)]
*  loss to the government. They don't care, [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3344.72s)]
*  they take away our market share. Now, we're fucked up. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3346.72s)]
*  You put a tariff on them, [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3348.72s)]
*  so that they don't attack... That's [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3350.72s)]
*  warfare. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3352.72s)]
*  You put a tariff on them, then US companies [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3354.72s)]
*  will be like, well, it's still more expensive to put them. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3356.72s)]
*  But it has to be [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3358.72s)]
*  strategic, because US Steel, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3360.72s)]
*  if we can't make steel in this country, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3362.72s)]
*  if something happens with the military, [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3364.72s)]
*  then we're fucked. So, it makes perfect sense. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3366.72s)]
*  Those are the tariffs that Biden [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3368.72s)]
*  kept in place. Those types [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3370.72s)]
*  of strategic tariffs. Because they protect us [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3372.72s)]
*  politically, they also protect the businesses, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3374.72s)]
*  but they don't allow another country [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3376.72s)]
*  to get some sort of [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3378.72s)]
*  advantage on us in an incredibly [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3380.72s)]
*  important marketplace for our [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3382.72s)]
*  protection. Bingo. Got it. Okay, now [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3384.72s)]
*  the other version. Now, the other are across the board [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3386.72s)]
*  tariffs, where Trump says, fuck you [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3388.72s)]
*  China, I'm adding [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3390.72s)]
*  10% or 20% or [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3392.72s)]
*  60% tariffs. He never says which is which, [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3394.72s)]
*  right? He just says, I'm adding tariffs. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3396.72s)]
*  So, Walmart. Walmart [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3398.72s)]
*  imports 80% of their products. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3400.72s)]
*  And so, Walmart is buying [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3402.72s)]
*  from China, paying in dollars, [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3404.72s)]
*  and saying, I'm paying a dollar [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3406.72s)]
*  for that widget. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3408.72s)]
*  And that dollar [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3410.72s)]
*  comes in, and it's a dollar right now, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3412.72s)]
*  and that's it. Walmart marks it up and sells the [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3414.72s)]
*  widget at Walmart. Tariffs [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3416.72s)]
*  it comes in, it gets to the United States, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3418.72s)]
*  when it comes across the border, there's [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3420.72s)]
*  a 10% tariffs. The border [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3422.72s)]
*  patrol says, ah, there's a 10% [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3424.72s)]
*  tariff on it. Walmart, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3426.72s)]
*  you have to pay 10% of that [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3428.72s)]
*  dollar, you have to pay me a dime for every [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3430.72s)]
*  one of these widgets that come in. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3432.72s)]
*  Walmart has a choice. They can either [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3434.72s)]
*  eat that dime, or they [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3436.72s)]
*  pass it on. Now, imagine, then he [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3438.72s)]
*  goes to John Deere, and he says, [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3440.72s)]
*  if you're thinking about moving [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3442.72s)]
*  any of your manufacturing to Mexico, [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3444.72s)]
*  even though he signed this [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3446.72s)]
*  thing called the USMCA, [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3448.72s)]
*  which allows you to move some of your manufacturing [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3450.72s)]
*  to Mexico, he signed it, he created [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3452.72s)]
*  it, but put that aside. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3454.72s)]
*  He says to them, okay, we're going [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3456.72s)]
*  to give you a 200% tariff for anything [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3458.72s)]
*  that you make that you then import, [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3460.72s)]
*  tractors, let's say. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3462.72s)]
*  So think about it. That's if John Deere moved [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3464.72s)]
*  their factories to another country. Even just a portion of [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3466.72s)]
*  them. Got it. Right. So he's basically [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3468.72s)]
*  saying, don't leave the US. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3470.72s)]
*  Don't leave, but it's not that easy, [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3472.72s)]
*  because now, if, [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3474.72s)]
*  so his... Can I ask you a real quick question about that? [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3476.72s)]
*  So when, let's say, China [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3478.72s)]
*  tried to undercut our market, they [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3480.72s)]
*  would sell the steel here. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3482.72s)]
*  Who would buy that steel, like a Home Depot [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3484.72s)]
*  or something? Yeah, someone who's building a building. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3486.72s)]
*  Someone who's building... So that company [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3488.72s)]
*  would have to pay [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3490.72s)]
*  that increased price. They would have to pay the tariff. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3492.72s)]
*  And basically, the tariff [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3494.72s)]
*  would be in place, so the company goes, well, [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3496.72s)]
*  I'd just rather buy the American steel, [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3498.72s)]
*  because it's the same price. Correct. 100%. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3500.72s)]
*  So that's on the strategic side. So it's [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3502.72s)]
*  always on the consumer of [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3504.72s)]
*  the business that's consuming the foreign [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3506.72s)]
*  goods here to pay the tariff. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3508.72s)]
*  They will then... [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3510.72s)]
*  Directly or indirectly, right? Yeah. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3512.72s)]
*  So whoever imports it has to [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3514.72s)]
*  write the check. Got it, got it, got it, got it. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3516.72s)]
*  So when Trump says China [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3518.72s)]
*  is paying for it, no. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3520.72s)]
*  He's not paying for it. Got it. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3522.72s)]
*  Ah, well, China [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3524.72s)]
*  could, in an effort [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3526.72s)]
*  to undercut the U.S. steel market, [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3528.72s)]
*  make it so low... On strategic stuff, yes. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3530.72s)]
*  But [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3532.72s)]
*  they're still... They're not the ones paying [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3534.72s)]
*  for it, whoever does the import. We do [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3536.72s)]
*  pay for it, but essentially, they would... Their [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3538.72s)]
*  government would be paying for the loss. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3540.72s)]
*  Right. They would be subsidized. They could be subsidized. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3542.72s)]
*  But if it's just like a Walmart product, so if it's strategic, [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3544.72s)]
*  that's one thing. Yeah. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3546.72s)]
*  Because you want to protect U.S. steel and other [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3548.72s)]
*  steel companies, because you need that [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3550.72s)]
*  to protect for military reasons and [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3552.72s)]
*  other reasons. Yep. If it's, [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3554.72s)]
*  you know, what's... If it's a shoe... [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3556.72s)]
*  Real quick, sorry to interrupt. I'm just [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3558.72s)]
*  trying to think of... What's it called? [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3560.72s)]
*  A strongman argument? For the steelman argument? [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3562.72s)]
*  Strongman, yeah, strongman. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3564.72s)]
*  If [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3566.72s)]
*  a tariff was placed and China still [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3568.72s)]
*  wanted to gain market share in steel in America, [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3570.72s)]
*  but if the tariff was significant enough [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3572.72s)]
*  that we could buy [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3574.72s)]
*  up all their steel while still manufacturing [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3576.72s)]
*  steel here, [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3578.72s)]
*  then we might even have a strategic advantage [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3580.72s)]
*  on China, this is a hypothetical, [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3582.72s)]
*  where they would not be producing [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3584.72s)]
*  enough steel to support their own army. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3586.72s)]
*  And we would... [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3588.72s)]
*  But then they would just say, we don't need [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3590.72s)]
*  to send it to America. And then they would [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3592.72s)]
*  stop the send. But there is [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3594.72s)]
*  a number that you could adjust dials to. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3596.72s)]
*  So the real question is, what does it take... [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3598.72s)]
*  Why can't American [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3600.72s)]
*  manufacturers make it cheap enough [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3602.72s)]
*  that you don't import it from China? [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3604.72s)]
*  Why is it that John [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3606.72s)]
*  Deere is considering moving [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3608.72s)]
*  manufacturing to Mexico [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3610.72s)]
*  rather than just doing... Cheaper labor, I assume. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3612.72s)]
*  Well, it's not just cheaper labor, there's technology [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3614.72s)]
*  and there's other things. But the... [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3616.72s)]
*  So Trump says, well, if we have [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3618.72s)]
*  these tariffs, then those companies [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3620.72s)]
*  will just manufacture here. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3622.72s)]
*  But think that through. If you [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3624.72s)]
*  could today manufacture [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3626.72s)]
*  it cheap enough so that you didn't have [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3628.72s)]
*  to import anything, wouldn't you [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3630.72s)]
*  do it? They'd be doing it already. The problem [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3632.72s)]
*  is that, even if you said, you know [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3634.72s)]
*  what, it's made in America. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3636.72s)]
*  And would you... [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3638.72s)]
*  Would Americans pay a little bit of a premium [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3640.72s)]
*  to be able to buy American-made? No. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3642.72s)]
*  They don't. They don't. It's unfortunate, [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3644.72s)]
*  but they don't. They don't. I have a company, [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3646.72s)]

*  browser extension, and it tells you if something [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3652.72s)]
*  was made in America or not. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3654.72s)]
*  I have two companies. I've got Guardian Bikes [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3656.72s)]
*  and Cost Plus, where we have a [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3658.72s)]

*  move their manufacturing from China here. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3662.72s)]
*  Cost Plus Drugs, instead of doing [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3664.72s)]
*  anything overseas, we build our manufacturing [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3666.72s)]
*  plant in Dallas. And the reason we [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3668.72s)]
*  were able to do that is because [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3670.72s)]
*  we used robotics. The only [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3672.72s)]
*  way that we're going to beat them [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3674.72s)]
*  is because we're smarter than the motherfuckers [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3676.72s)]
*  and we've got better technology. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3678.72s)]
*  But when Trump says tariffs, [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3680.72s)]
*  he doesn't say, look, let me [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3682.72s)]
*  help you invest in more robotics [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3684.72s)]
*  so we can kick their ass. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3686.72s)]
*  Because that you would agree with. Yeah, that I would agree with. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3688.72s)]
*  That's what Harris is saying. That's why [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3690.72s)]
*  she said the other day in Pittsburgh, [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3692.72s)]

*  if you move anything at all, even if [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3702.72s)]
*  it's best for your business, there'll be punitive managers. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3704.72s)]
*  There'll be punitive managers. But I understand the concern [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3706.72s)]
*  of why that is an effective [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3708.72s)]
*  strategy for American voters. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3710.72s)]
*  Because if you're somebody from Detroit and you watch [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3712.72s)]
*  the audio industry leave Detroit, [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3714.72s)]
*  you probably heard of those stories if you work [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3716.72s)]
*  at the John Deere factory. And you're like, [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3718.72s)]
*  whether it's logical or not, you start [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3720.72s)]
*  going, well, he's the guy who's going to keep my job [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3722.72s)]
*  here. Even if it's not the case. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3724.72s)]
*  But they already know because they've already lost those jobs. That's already happened. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3726.72s)]
*  There's been plants that left. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3728.72s)]
*  He said the same thing to a carrier plant [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3730.72s)]
*  in Indianapolis in 2017. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3732.72s)]
*  I remember this. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3734.72s)]
*  Where they were going to move to Mexico. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3736.72s)]
*  The carrier just played [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3738.72s)]
*  them like a fiddle. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3740.72s)]
*  He got Mike Pence to [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3742.72s)]
*  go to the state of Indiana to [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3744.72s)]
*  give carrier money in order to [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3746.72s)]
*  keep those jobs there. But what Carrier [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3748.72s)]
*  did was, OK, we won't send those jobs [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3750.72s)]
*  to Mexico. We'll cut other jobs. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3752.72s)]
*  But the jobs that you wanted us [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3754.72s)]
*  not to send to Mexico, cool. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3756.72s)]
*  And when it was all said and done, they ended up [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3758.72s)]
*  moving to Mexico anyways. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3760.72s)]
*  There was a plant in [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3762.72s)]
*  Wisconsin that was going [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3764.72s)]
*  to be built by this company called Foxconn. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3766.72s)]
*  And it was going to be this big, I don't [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3768.72s)]
*  even remember what. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3770.72s)]
*  They got all this money [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3772.72s)]
*  from Paul Ryan or whoever the governor was [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3774.72s)]
*  back then in Wisconsin. They didn't [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3776.72s)]
*  build shit. So the theory would be [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3778.72s)]
*  because I'm listening to Trump talk about it, I'm like, oh, theoretically, if [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3780.72s)]
*  tariffs are high enough, manufacturing [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3782.72s)]
*  will build back up in America because there's a [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3784.72s)]
*  demand and we need manufacturing in America. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3786.72s)]
*  What you're saying is people aren't just going to buy [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3788.72s)]
*  the cheaper product always. They don't give a fuck [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3790.72s)]
*  where it's made. Unfortunately, because I like, I've [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3792.72s)]
*  tried other people have tried. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3794.72s)]
*  But if you just [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3796.72s)]
*  look, just think of it from common as an [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3798.72s)]
*  entrepreneur, as an entrepreneur. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3800.72s)]
*  If I know that Walmart is buying [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3802.72s)]
*  widgets for a dollar each [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3804.72s)]
*  and I can put something together [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3806.72s)]
*  to make them for 98 cents [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3808.72s)]
*  each, people buy for 98. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3810.72s)]
*  I'm going to put it together. And so was every other [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3812.72s)]
*  entrepreneur in the United States of [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3814.72s)]
*  America. Yeah. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3816.72s)]
*  Trying to say, don't import [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3818.72s)]
*  it like if you could do [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3820.72s)]
*  it cheaper, you would be doing it. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3822.72s)]
*  But so here's the question. Like we have to invest in [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3824.72s)]
*  robotics. Yeah. Right. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3826.72s)]
*  But isn't that on the business? Like, is it on [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3828.72s)]
*  the government to develop these robotics and [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3830.72s)]
*  then go, by the way, businesses, don't you want to use them? [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3832.72s)]
*  That's part of those programs we [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3834.72s)]
*  talked about before, you know, [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3836.72s)]
*  because you have to do robotics [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3838.72s)]
*  for the military. And so the Department [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3840.72s)]
*  of Defense and does a lot of duct tape was [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3842.72s)]
*  invented by NASA. All that stuff. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3844.72s)]
*  It trickles out. So it's developed at the [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3846.72s)]
*  highest level. Boston Dynamics is first going to develop [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3848.72s)]
*  something for the military and eventually it's going to be in [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3850.72s)]
*  some kid's iPad. Yeah. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3852.72s)]
*  And just some projects are just [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3854.72s)]
*  too big. And so it just [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3856.72s)]
*  takes too much money. Like AI. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3858.72s)]
*  That's the AI shit. Did you see Microsoft [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3860.72s)]
*  bought the island? [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3862.72s)]
*  Three Mile Island. Yeah. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3864.72s)]
*  For over a billion dollars. This is kind [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3866.72s)]
*  of crazy. Maybe explain to them. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3868.72s)]
*  So AI uses a shit ton [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3870.72s)]
*  of electricity. Shit ton. And by the way, [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3872.72s)]
*  just a little aside, when people talk about AI [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3874.72s)]
*  taking jobs, because it uses [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3876.72s)]
*  so much electricity. Fucking [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3878.72s)]
*  plumbers, electricians, [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3880.72s)]
*  power engineers, all [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3882.72s)]
*  these people, the jobs are going to skyrocket. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3884.72s)]
*  And they're blue collar jobs too. Those are all [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3886.72s)]
*  blue collar. Because the facility to generate [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3888.72s)]
*  all of this electricity. All that power. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3890.72s)]
*  That's interesting. And so they require [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3892.72s)]
*  so much power. And that's why, you know, solar [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3894.72s)]
*  farms and everything. I mean, there's programs [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3896.72s)]
*  now where [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3898.72s)]
*  if you have solar energy [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3900.72s)]
*  on your home and you [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3902.72s)]
*  have excess time of day, you could sell it to the [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3904.72s)]
*  local utility plant. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3906.72s)]
*  And so there's going to be all these [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3908.72s)]
*  ways to generate power that we need. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3910.72s)]
*  And so Microsoft did a deal [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3912.72s)]
*  and bought Three Mile Island. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3914.72s)]
*  Give a little background to what Three Mile Island? [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3916.72s)]
*  I mean, I don't know the whole strip, but [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3918.72s)]
*  it's like a nuclear [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3920.72s)]
*  plant that burned down basically. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3922.72s)]
*  One of them, I think they had multiple plants. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3924.72s)]
*  I think one of them had a problem. One of the reactors [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3926.72s)]
*  had something happen and [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3928.72s)]
*  it had a nuclear meltdown. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3930.72s)]
*  But it's still functioning. The others are still [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3932.72s)]
*  functioning. And they basically bought it because they needed [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3934.72s)]
*  nuclear energy. It just requires [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3936.72s)]
*  so much electricity to [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3938.72s)]
*  run all the simulations, right? [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3940.72s)]
*  Because you're synthesizing data sets. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3942.72s)]
*  They're just training all these models. It just takes so much [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3944.72s)]
*  more. And the power of the chance. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3946.72s)]
*  They bought a nuclear reactor island. That's something [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3948.72s)]
*  out of like a Bond movie. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3950.72s)]
*  It's insane. It's insane. But, you know, [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3952.72s)]
*  it comes down to, do you [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3954.72s)]
*  want to give incentives to companies [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3956.72s)]
*  to work with the government and do these [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3958.72s)]
*  projects? Or do you want to take a hammer and just [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3960.72s)]
*  say, fuck you, bitch. You will do it this way. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3962.72s)]
*  That's the difference. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3964.72s)]
*  And I think that's what people don't [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3966.72s)]
*  get. But to your point, Andrew, [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3968.72s)]
*  he's a great salesperson. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3970.72s)]
*  He sells it and he says [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3972.72s)]
*  it the way people want to hear it. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3974.72s)]
*  And if you're not looking [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3976.72s)]
*  to get into the details like I might, [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3978.72s)]
*  then it's just like, fuck, that makes sense. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3980.72s)]
*  Well, I think people are emotional, right? [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3982.72s)]
*  I think we make decisions off of emotion. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3984.72s)]
*  What I will say is like, the [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3986.72s)]
*  first term that he ran, I think he was spot [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3988.72s)]
*  on to what [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3990.72s)]
*  people were feeling that [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3992.72s)]
*  wasn't being spoken about. He was like, [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3994.72s)]
*  it was a laser point. 100%. And I think [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3996.72s)]
*  every election since, he's been a few [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=3998.72s)]
*  like standard deviations away from [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4000.72s)]
*  that mean. And I don't think Kamala's [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4002.72s)]
*  on it either. I don't think either one are like [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4004.72s)]
*  hitting the zeitgeist. I agree. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4006.72s)]
*  What do you think the zeitgeist is right now? [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4008.72s)]
*  What do you think the general feeling [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4010.72s)]
*  of Americans is? Pissed off. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4012.72s)]
*  About? Everything. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4014.72s)]
*  Because everything's a fight. Everything's a battle. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4016.72s)]
*  There's nothing that's easy anymore. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4018.72s)]
*  Everybody is just fucking with everybody, [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4020.72s)]
*  yelling at everybody, worried about [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4022.72s)]
*  everything. And it's like [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4024.72s)]
*  nobody, there's no facts [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4026.72s)]
*  we agree on. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4028.72s)]
*  Dude, it is, [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4030.72s)]
*  for all the amazing things that the internet has given us, [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4032.72s)]
*  it has also eroded [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4034.72s)]
*  our confidence in everything. Everything. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4036.72s)]
*  There is just [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4038.72s)]
*  as much proof that vaccines [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4040.72s)]
*  are good, that they are bad. I don't know if it's [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4042.72s)]
*  just as much, but there's a doctor out there who will tell you [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4044.72s)]
*  these vaccines are horrible. There's a doctor that will say that. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4046.72s)]
*  There's like six of them, but when you talk, [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4048.72s)]
*  there's one million doctors, because I did [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4050.72s)]
*  this project where we talked about [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4052.72s)]
*  going to med school for free, so that [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4054.72s)]
*  we have more doctors and get them into different places. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4056.72s)]
*  Like 95% [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4058.72s)]
*  of doctors have been fully vaccinated. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4060.72s)]
*  So the five [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4062.72s)]
*  doctors that are like, but we don't need to get into that [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4064.72s)]
*  vaccine shit. The point is more like [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4066.72s)]
*  if there's one that is a [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4068.72s)]
*  doctor that says, hey, [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4070.72s)]
*  I don't know, it makes you at least, 100%. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4072.72s)]
*  As a person who just went to college, you're like, [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4074.72s)]
*  well, I don't fucking know. That guy's got the outfit on, [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4076.72s)]
*  he must be right about it. And he validates what I'm feeling, [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4078.72s)]
*  so I'm good. Exactly. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4080.72s)]
*  I agree with that. All the way through. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4082.72s)]
*  It's hard. There's no institution [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4084.72s)]
*  that I think we feel confident in right now. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4086.72s)]
*  Because there's no leadership and there's no trust. When there's no [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4088.72s)]
*  leadership, there's no trust. And there's no [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4090.72s)]
*  control of information. I'm not saying the government should control [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4092.72s)]
*  information. I love the freedom of it. But [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4094.72s)]
*  when they did control the information, [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4096.719999999999s)]
*  they could curate narratives that we all [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4098.719999999999s)]
*  kind of fell in line with. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4100.719999999999s)]
*  And we started to believe, and these narratives had [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4102.72s)]
*  built in confidence. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4104.72s)]
*  The idea of America was [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4106.72s)]
*  this romanticized [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4108.72s)]
*  version of it. And then you get [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4110.72s)]
*  open source information. You start learning [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4112.72s)]
*  like, wow, there's some kind of fucked up things. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4114.72s)]
*  And you see, there's other people who believe the same thing. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4116.72s)]
*  So it used to be you were the only one [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4118.72s)]
*  at the gym that would talk about [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4120.72s)]
*  this shit. And now you can find [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4122.72s)]
*  a million people. Especially like you go from [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4124.72s)]
*  150 million people [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4126.72s)]
*  30 years ago, whatever, in the country, [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4128.72s)]
*  to 330 million now. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4130.72s)]
*  It's an instant growth, huh? [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4132.72s)]
*  If 1% of people are really [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4134.72s)]
*  fucked up, that's a whole lot of [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4136.72s)]
*  fucked up people. 3.3 [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4138.72s)]
*  million fucked up people. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4140.72s)]
*  Wow. So that shit [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4142.72s)]
*  just grows. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4144.72s)]
*  If we had a strong [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4146.72s)]
*  leader, I'm not saying Kamala [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4148.72s)]
*  is the strongest leader. There's things I [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4150.72s)]
*  don't agree with her at all. I think [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4152.72s)]
*  she winds up when she answers [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4154.72s)]
*  questions. I'm not a fan of [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4156.72s)]
*  ending the filibuster, which I think is a huge [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4158.72s)]
*  mistake. So there's a lot of things I disagree [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4160.72s)]
*  with her on. But I think her [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4162.72s)]
*  heart's in the right place. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4164.72s)]
*  If you believe like I do, that [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4166.72s)]
*  we want people to trust, that [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4168.72s)]
*  we want someone who tries to bring people together [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4170.72s)]
*  that isn't negative towards [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4172.72s)]
*  people. You've heard her pick on Trump [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4174.72s)]
*  and JD Vance, but she hasn't [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4176.72s)]
*  said anything about Trump supporters. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4178.72s)]
*  She said she'll talk to Republicans, [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4180.72s)]
*  she'll talk to independents, she'll get [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4182.72s)]
*  ideas from anybody, and she [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4184.72s)]
*  truly will. And to me, that's [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4186.72s)]
*  important because the one certainty [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4188.72s)]
*  you have about the presidency [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4190.72s)]
*  and life in general, you don't know what the fuck's going to [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4192.72s)]
*  happen tomorrow. You just [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4194.72s)]
*  don't. And you want somebody, you know, there's this [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4196.72s)]
*  old, old, old saying that says, character [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4198.72s)]
*  is destiny. The type [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4200.72s)]
*  of person that you are [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4202.72s)]
*  guides how you make decisions. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4204.72s)]
*  And while she's far from perfect, [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4206.72s)]
*  I just think her character [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4208.72s)]
*  will guide her in the right direction to put [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4210.72s)]
*  American people first. And [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4212.72s)]
*  I just think Donald Trump's going to put himself first. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4214.72s)]
*  I just don't think he's going to [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4216.72s)]
*  put anybody else in front of him. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4218.72s)]
*  And you talk about what happened before, [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4220.72s)]
*  every single thing he's done. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4222.72s)]
*  Those 40 out of 44 cabinet members [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4224.72s)]
*  who came out against him, [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4226.72s)]
*  they didn't say we disagreed. They said [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4228.72s)]
*  he was unfit for office because [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4230.72s)]
*  he did shit for himself first. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4232.72s)]
*  Literally, like, during 2020 [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4234.72s)]
*  when we had the Black Lives Matters [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4236.72s)]
*  riots and protests, the motherfucker [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4238.72s)]
*  didn't say, calm down, let's [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4240.72s)]
*  bring people together. He goes, [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4242.72s)]
*  when the looting starts, [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4244.72s)]
*  the shooting starts. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4246.72s)]
*  Bars. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4248.72s)]
*  That is bars, though. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4250.72s)]
*  If you were going to loot that day, [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4252.72s)]
*  you'd be like, maybe not today. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4254.72s)]
*  Unless it was Washington, D.C. in the capital, [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4256.72s)]
*  then it's like, we don't [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4258.72s)]
*  need those magatrometers, [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4260.72s)]
*  the things to check for guns and everything. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4262.72s)]
*  We let them in. Right, let them in. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4264.72s)]
*  It was just a vacation. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4266.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4268.72s)]
*  How do you feel about the lopsided Supreme Court? [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4270.72s)]
*  I mean, I'm not happy about it, [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4272.72s)]
*  but [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4274.72s)]
*  I'm not surprised about it. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4276.72s)]
*  But I'm not a fan of trying to expand the Supreme [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4278.72s)]
*  Court at all. Now, I'm all [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4280.72s)]
*  for term limits, so that [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4282.72s)]
*  instead of doing it for life... It's insane that you just get to die. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4284.72s)]
*  No matter how senile you are, [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4286.72s)]
*  you just can't hold on. So I think that's wrong, [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4288.72s)]
*  but I don't think you expanded to [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4290.72s)]
*  70, because then the next president who [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4292.72s)]
*  disagrees with you just does the same thing, and it's just [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4294.72s)]
*  a clusterfuck. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4296.72s)]
*  So I think when the Democrats talk about that, [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4298.72s)]
*  they're full of shit. Why are you against the Film Buster? [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4300.72s)]
*  Because I think that [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4302.72s)]
*  requiring 60 votes to get something [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4304.72s)]
*  changed means you have to convince people [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4306.72s)]
*  who disagree with you. And I think [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4308.72s)]
*  that's important. And I think to get... [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4310.72s)]
*  If we're going to have [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4312.72s)]
*  any chance of bringing people together, [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4314.72s)]
*  you've got to have [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4316.72s)]
*  incentives to bring people [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4318.72s)]
*  together. Politicians, parties, [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4320.72s)]
*  citizens, [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4322.72s)]
*  voters, nonvoters. You've got [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4324.72s)]
*  to go through that process, and having the Film Buster [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4326.72s)]
*  protects that. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4328.72s)]
*  And so I think she's wrong in saying [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4330.72s)]
*  no Film Buster. But I'm pro-choice, right? [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4332.72s)]
*  So I understand why she wants to do it. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4334.72s)]
*  I've got two daughters. I don't want anybody [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4336.72s)]
*  making the decision for them. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4338.72s)]
*  But I don't think [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4340.72s)]
*  changing the Film Buster is the way to do it at all. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4342.72s)]
*  It is [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4344.72s)]
*  unfortunate [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4346.72s)]
*  to state the Supreme Court, [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4348.72s)]
*  because in its inception, you're like, [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4350.72s)]
*  okay, these are the greatest constitutional [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4352.72s)]
*  minds that the country has. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4354.72s)]
*  They are not partisan. They look at [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4356.72s)]
*  the document, and this is how they feel. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4358.72s)]
*  And they look at the voting records, and they're [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4360.72s)]
*  absolutely partisan. So it's almost like [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4362.72s)]
*  elected officials that just have this... [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4364.72s)]
*  If you're going to be an elected official, [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4366.72s)]
*  okay, let's get you out of here every six years. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4368.72s)]
*  It could be ten years, whatever it is, if we feel [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4370.72s)]
*  like you are too biased. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4372.72s)]
*  But I like the idea behind it. The idea behind it [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4374.72s)]
*  is like, hey, listen, everybody's [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4376.72s)]
*  biased, except this [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4378.72s)]
*  person we think is really smart and really fair. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4380.72s)]
*  Get him in there for life, and let's keep him around. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4382.72s)]
*  This person that gets appointed by the [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4384.72s)]
*  president who has his own biases. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4386.72s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4388.72s)]
*  Can we realistically get term limits? [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4390.72s)]
*  I just don't know how you get that done. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4392.72s)]
*  It would be very difficult. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4394.72s)]
*  This is a branch of government that has existed [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4396.72s)]
*  from the inception. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4398.72s)]
*  And you have to convince the people who have the power [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4400.72s)]
*  to let go of the power. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4402.72s)]
*  They're not going to do that. They probably won't do it. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4404.72s)]
*  I guess you just hope that they uphold the law. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4406.72s)]
*  They have some integrity. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4408.72s)]
*  I don't know. Again, you don't trust. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4410.72s)]
*  Alright guys, we're going to take a break real quick [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4412.72s)]

*  but I do think that [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4494.72s)]
*  there is a, for [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4496.72s)]
*  a country like America that thrives [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4498.72s)]
*  off self-esteem, American [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4500.72s)]
*  excellence is really important to us. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4502.72s)]
*  It's part of our DNA. It's baked into [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4504.72s)]
*  our identity. Every movie that we watch exemplifies [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4506.72s)]
*  it. And I feel like our [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4508.72s)]
*  confidence is at an all-time low. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4510.72s)]
*  I agree. And how [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4512.72s)]
*  do you build the confidence [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4514.72s)]
*  of a nation that [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4516.72s)]
*  feels like it's eroding [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4518.72s)]
*  a little bit? You go door to door. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4520.72s)]
*  You know, you really have got to go [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4522.72s)]
*  where people don't expect you to be seen [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4524.72s)]
*  and talk to people. And let them know. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4526.72s)]
*  What do you tell, like, what do you give them to believe? [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4528.72s)]
*  And like, the Olympics came around, [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4530.72s)]
*  and I felt like for a few [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4532.72s)]
*  weeks, we cared about the sports we [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4534.72s)]
*  don't give a fuck about, and we're winning, and [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4536.72s)]
*  we're like, ah, we're back. American excellence [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4538.72s)]
*  is great. And then it stops and everybody [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4540.72s)]
*  goes back to the government is corrupt, the pharmaceutical [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4542.72s)]
*  industries are corrupt, the military industrial complex [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4544.72s)]
*  is corrupt. What is the thing that [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4546.72s)]
*  we get to sit down and go, you know what, I'm [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4548.72s)]
*  proud to be an American because of this? [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4550.72s)]
*  I mean, I'd like to think the American [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4554.72s)]
*  dream. The one [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4556.72s)]
*  thing that makes us different than every other [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4558.72s)]
*  country is everybody in this [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4560.72s)]
*  room, everybody watching, they [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4562.72s)]
*  either have had or think [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4564.72s)]
*  they'll have some idea that they can [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4566.72s)]
*  start a business around, that [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4568.72s)]
*  or somebody will invest in them [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4570.72s)]
*  for who they are and what they believe in. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4572.72s)]
*  And that's what makes this country [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4574.72s)]
*  different. You know, I go talk to kids [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4576.72s)]
*  all the time and I'll say, look around, see [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4578.72s)]
*  that light, see that picture, see that [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4580.72s)]
*  screen, see that camera, see that. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4582.72s)]
*  One day it didn't exist. And somebody [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4584.72s)]
*  could look like you, could be like [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4586.72s)]
*  you, said, I have this idea. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4588.72s)]
*  And followed through. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4590.72s)]
*  And now that table, you know, [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4592.72s)]
*  that drink, that light, that was because [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4594.72s)]
*  somebody came up with this idea. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4596.72s)]
*  And I say to these kids, why not you? [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4598.72s)]
*  Why can't you be that one [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4600.72s)]
*  to come up with this idea? And there's [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4602.72s)]
*  nobody that can stop you but you, but you [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4604.72s)]
*  got to do the work. And I think [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4606.72s)]
*  when we give people a reason to [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4608.72s)]
*  believe in themselves and show [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4610.72s)]
*  them that there's a future for themselves, [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4612.72s)]
*  that they can come up with that idea, [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4614.72s)]
*  they can get that job, they can learn [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4616.72s)]
*  that learning is actually a skill [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4618.72s)]
*  that can take you places. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4620.72s)]
*  Then I think we'll start to [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4622.72s)]
*  respect each other because if I think you [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4624.72s)]
*  are going to do something that you believe in, okay, [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4626.72s)]
*  I respect you for that. If I think you [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4628.72s)]
*  are going to do it or anybody's going to do it. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4630.72s)]
*  So entrepreneurship and education are still [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4632.72s)]
*  I think core. That's who we've been our entire [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4634.72s)]
*  history. And that's I would still [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4636.72s)]
*  education I think is taking a little bit of a hit [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4638.72s)]
*  if you look in the traditional sense. I agree. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4640.72s)]
*  But education in terms of there [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4642.72s)]
*  is information out there that can help me [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4644.72s)]
*  achieve my dream. I think still [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4646.72s)]
*  exists and entrepreneurship absolutely [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4648.72s)]
*  does. And then if you add to it like Chachi PT [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4650.72s)]
*  or Gemini or any of the [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4652.72s)]
*  AI, now you see kids that [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4654.72s)]
*  are, we're all using it, right? [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4656.72s)]
*  Just because it's a shortcut. And so [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4658.72s)]
*  you can teach yourself anything. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4660.72s)]
*  Even before the large language [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4662.72s)]
*  models from AI, [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4664.72s)]
*  even if you went online and started searching, [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4666.72s)]
*  you had to decide what was [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4668.72s)]
*  good content or bad content. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4670.72s)]
*  And I'm not saying these AI large language [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4672.72s)]
*  models are all right, but [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4674.72s)]
*  between three or four of them, you can [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4676.72s)]
*  set up a syllabus, [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4678.72s)]
*  you can set up a program to teach yourself anything. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4680.72s)]
*  It's pretty amazing. Anything. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4682.72s)]
*  And so I think [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4684.72s)]
*  you nailed it when you said the internet [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4686.72s)]
*  went from this beautiful thing back in the day where [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4688.72s)]
*  we were going to have access to information [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4690.72s)]
*  to it being a [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4692.72s)]
*  a shithole in a lot of respects, [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4694.72s)]
*  particularly with social media. But now [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4696.72s)]
*  I'm hoping with [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4698.72s)]
*  AI and the Chachi PT [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4700.72s)]
*  and the Geminis, etc. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4702.72s)]
*  That can give everybody a chance to [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4704.72s)]
*  learn. The analogy I use is [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4706.72s)]
*  remember when like those [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4708.72s)]
*  like Nigerian credit card [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4710.72s)]
*  scams popped up, right? [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4712.72s)]
*  In early internet days, you get an [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4714.72s)]
*  email and they're like, hey, if you give me $50,000, [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4716.72s)]
*  you're going to be a millionaire. People fell for that [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4718.72s)]
*  because you were so excited and you [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4720.72s)]
*  didn't believe that somebody could dupe you [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4722.72s)]
*  on the internet. And I feel like that's what [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4724.72s)]
*  we're going through with information. Yes, [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4726.72s)]
*  100%. And I think in like [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4728.72s)]
*  maybe five years or 10 years, these large [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4730.72s)]
*  language models will agree. Something will change, [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4732.72s)]
*  right? It's not going to be like I remember back [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4734.72s)]
*  in the day when we were starting Broadcast, audio net [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4736.72s)]
*  before broadcast dot com, people [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4738.72s)]
*  talking about you cannot [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4740.72s)]
*  give your credit card to anybody on the internet. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4742.72s)]
*  Amazon, Amazon [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4744.72s)]
*  will not succeed. Amazon will fail [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4746.72s)]
*  because no one's still saying that [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4748.72s)]
*  to the people. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4750.72s)]
*  Amazon will [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4752.72s)]
*  fail because no one's going to give [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4754.72s)]
*  them a fucking credit card. I remember being skeptical [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4756.72s)]
*  of PayPal. Like, well, I'm just, they're just going [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4758.72s)]
*  to have to have the same way. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4760.72s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4762.72s)]
*  And now it's, yeah, it's no, [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4764.72s)]
*  AI question. What do you think is the [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4766.72s)]
*  ultimate destiny of AI? How [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4768.72s)]
*  would you think it [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4770.72s)]
*  destroys humanity? No, [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4772.72s)]
*  I don't think so. Here's kind of the reference point [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4774.72s)]
*  that I think protects us. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4776.72s)]
*  Like I have a mini Australian [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4778.72s)]
*  Shepherd. You guys have dogs at all? [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4780.72s)]
*  They're smart dogs and dumb dogs, right? [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4782.72s)]
*  You take a smart dog, you can put it almost anywhere. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4784.72s)]
*  If you put a smart dog [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4786.72s)]
*  in the middle of the street, in the middle of nowhere [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4788.72s)]
*  where they've never been before, they're going to [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4790.72s)]
*  figure out where the danger is and all that. They're going to [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4792.72s)]
*  get across the street and take you across the street. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4794.72s)]
*  And so if you had a choice [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4796.72s)]
*  of going in a full service, and I'm [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4798.72s)]
*  not trying to rip on Tesla and just using this as [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4800.72s)]
*  an example, full service, [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4802.72s)]
*  full self-service driving car. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4804.72s)]
*  If it hasn't [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4806.72s)]
*  seen something in front of it before, [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4808.72s)]
*  because it hasn't been trained on it, [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4810.72s)]
*  it's going to [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4812.72s)]
*  fuck up. It's going to run into [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4814.72s)]
*  that. So if there's like a blob [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4816.72s)]
*  that's just sitting there that's never seen before, [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4818.72s)]
*  it's not going to know what to do. And it can run into a pedestrian [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4820.72s)]
*  or whatever. You put my mini [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4822.72s)]
*  Australian Shepherd there and it sees a blob, [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4824.72s)]
*  it's going to bark a few times, but then [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4826.72s)]
*  go around it and realize there's no other risk. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4828.72s)]
*  Until AI is as smart as a [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4830.72s)]
*  puppy, [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4832.72s)]
*  it's not going to be all that great a risk. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4834.72s)]
*  I don't think. Now it doesn't [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4836.72s)]
*  mean, like, I can give you tons of scary [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4838.72s)]
*  shit too. Like, I can tell you [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4840.72s)]
*  about little, you know, fly [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4842.72s)]
*  size or maybe bigger drones [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4844.72s)]
*  that are all controlled by AI that, [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4846.72s)]
*  you know, you're going to see these drone [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4848.72s)]
*  attacks of a million little insect [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4850.72s)]
*  drones and they're all controlled [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4852.72s)]
*  by AI and self-thinking and [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4854.72s)]
*  da-da-da-da-da. That shit's going to be scary [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4856.72s)]
*  as fuck. When that happens, [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4858.72s)]
*  I don't know, but it's going to happen. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4860.72s)]
*  But in terms of, you know, [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4862.72s)]
*  like the movie AI and, [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4864.72s)]
*  you know, robotics taking over [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4866.72s)]
*  and robots taking over, [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4868.72s)]
*  no, not for [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4870.72s)]
*  a long, long time. Life will get better [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4872.72s)]
*  before it gets worse. Yeah, yeah, because [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4874.72s)]
*  if it's not going to be as smart as a puppy [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4876.72s)]
*  or even a cat, cats are dumb as fuck [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4878.72s)]
*  and they figure out how to fall [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4880.72s)]
*  and land on their feet. So then [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4882.72s)]
*  do you not subscribe to, [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4884.72s)]
*  and I'm not trying to say this so that you like beat up [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4886.72s)]
*  on Elon, but like are you, are you, you [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4888.72s)]
*  wouldn't trust the, the Tesla [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4890.72s)]
*  auto drive? Not with my [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4892.72s)]
*  eyes closed the whole time. Interesting. No. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4894.72s)]
*  He sleeps in it. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4896.72s)]
*  Yeah, guy goes to bed. Oh, while you're driving? [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4898.72s)]
*  I was an early adopter. I love that. Yeah. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4900.72s)]
*  Look, I have it too and I play with it, [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4902.72s)]
*  but it still scares the shit out of me. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4904.72s)]
*  Would I want my family to just close their [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4906.72s)]
*  eyes and let it drive itself? [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4908.72s)]
*  No, no. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4910.72s)]
*  But do I see the value? Absolutely. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4912.72s)]
*  Now, if it were up to me, [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4914.72s)]
*  then I said this to the city of Dallas. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4916.72s)]
*  You know, like when you go to Vegas, you can't cross the [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4918.72s)]
*  strip. You have to go up over the strip. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4920.72s)]
*  You gotta walk over. I would be pushing [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4922.72s)]
*  if I'm Elon, I'm pushing to put those in [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4924.72s)]
*  every downtown that you possibly can. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4926.72s)]
*  Even, you know, working on deals. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4928.72s)]
*  So there's no pedestrians [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4930.72s)]
*  to hit. And then... Unsightly. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4932.72s)]
*  Yeah, but put that aside. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4934.72s)]
*  Like, now you can... [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4936.72s)]
*  It's like, what a fucking [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4938.72s)]
*  pushy. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4940.72s)]
*  Yeah, look at that little crosswalk. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4942.72s)]
*  So we'll let you decorate it. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4944.72s)]
*  Yeah, we'll let you decorate it. I'm looking like some lady [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4946.72s)]
*  turned to jelly every once in a while. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4948.72s)]
*  Then a bridge over everything. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4950.72s)]
*  Well, you get to look up, right? Yeah. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4952.72s)]
*  Well, I get, yeah. You know, you can put that, [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4954.72s)]
*  you know, opens the window. What a simple idea [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4956.72s)]
*  to just make no more accidents. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4958.72s)]
*  And I'm just like, ugh, but the bridge. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4960.72s)]
*  You have to look at the bridge. You see what I'm saying though, right? [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4962.72s)]
*  You just put that crosswalk over top [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4964.72s)]
*  Could you put them underground? You could put them [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4966.72s)]
*  underground. A lot of cities have them underground. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4968.72s)]
*  And, you know, Elon could use the boring company [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4970.72s)]
*  and just, you know. Oh, yeah. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4972.72s)]
*  But you put it underground. But you would never do that [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4974.72s)]
*  in New York City. Like, imagine a bridge on every [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4976.72s)]
*  single street. That's crazy. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4978.72s)]
*  How would you get the 18-wheelers in? [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4980.72s)]
*  If it looks nice, it'll be fine. Yeah. Really? [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4982.72s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, because think of the [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4984.72s)]
*  value proposition. Yeah, you gotta [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4986.72s)]
*  walk up and walk over, but still, [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4988.72s)]
*  like, every car can be self-driving. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4990.72s)]
*  Every delivery can be [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4992.72s)]
*  self-driving. That is true. You can then start [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4994.72s)]
*  building buildings where Elon has one of his [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4996.72s)]
*  trucks, and they just back in, and there's [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=4998.72s)]
*  no human involved. And it's just [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5000.72s)]
*  you, Costco, I think it was, [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5002.72s)]
*  is building a new [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5004.72s)]
*  Costco, but it's gonna be [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5006.72s)]
*  in the middle of all these apartments. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5008.72s)]
*  And you can automate all that shit. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5010.72s)]
*  You know, you put your freezer, so it just [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5012.72s)]
*  backs up. Holy shit. Wow. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5014.72s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait, just so everybody [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5016.72s)]
*  understands what just happened. So the unit, [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5018.72s)]
*  your refrigerator, backs [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5020.72s)]
*  up to a [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5022.72s)]
*  Costco, potentially, that's on the inside. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5024.72s)]
*  So it's got, like, a little delivery door. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5026.72s)]
*  It just refills you with ice cream. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5028.72s)]
*  Like a convenience store, you know, [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5030.72s)]
*  the fridges and load them from the back. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5032.72s)]
*  Yeah, exactly right, exactly right. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5034.72s)]
*  I think Diddy has that for the baby oil. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5036.72s)]
*  Cause he can. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5040.72s)]
*  That was embottled. Great. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5042.72s)]
*  Yeah, that is, what a [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5044.72s)]
*  crazy idea. Give me some more of these, like, innovations [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5046.72s)]
*  you think will see happening. That's the shit I think about all the time. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5048.72s)]
*  Yeah, this is exciting to me, like, whoa. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5050.72s)]
*  Give us your designs for city, [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5052.72s)]
*  business, whatever these are. I didn't give it away. It's IP for free. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5054.72s)]
*  Are you trying to develop [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5056.72s)]
*  some of this stuff? No, no, no. My mission is to [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5058.72s)]
*  fuck up the healthcare industry. So that's my focus. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5060.72s)]
*  Okay, so then fuck up the other industries [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5062.72s)]
*  while you focus on this. Give us the details for that. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5064.72s)]
*  No, I mean, but seriously, [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5066.72s)]
*  that's just something I always thought about when it came to [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5068.72s)]
*  self-driving cars, because I want them to work. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5070.72s)]
*  I want it to work for Elon. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5072.72s)]
*  I think that's important for the country, you know, [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5074.72s)]
*  for civilization. I think [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5076.72s)]
*  he's doing an amazing, look, I [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5078.72s)]
*  fuck with Elon on Twitter because he fucks [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5080.72s)]
*  with everybody on Twitter. But he's [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5082.72s)]
*  the best entrepreneur of our generation [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5084.72s)]
*  by far. It's not even close. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5086.72s)]
*  The shit he does is just insanely [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5088.72s)]
*  wild. Yeah, it's wild. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5090.72s)]
*  Even before Twitter was the [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5092.72s)]
*  man. I loved him. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5094.72s)]
*  Elon posts Twitter. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5096.72s)]
*  He became politicized, and I knew [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5098.72s)]
*  the second it happened. Please don't. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5100.72s)]
*  It fucked it up. Don't. Don't go off the deep end like that. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5102.72s)]
*  That is the thing that you should be concerned about, too. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5104.72s)]
*  Like, I understand that you're doing this [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5106.72s)]
*  because you think that this is... But once the election's over, [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5108.72s)]
*  it's over. You're back to... And here's what I also give you credit for. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5110.72s)]
*  Elon is very [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5112.72s)]
*  transparently pro-Republican [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5114.72s)]
*  and pretends he cares about it for the sake [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5116.72s)]
*  of the country, and it's very obvious you don't really give a fuck [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5118.72s)]
*  about the country. You have some ulterior motive. You never [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5120.72s)]
*  say Democrat, Republican, conservative, [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5122.72s)]
*  un-rural. No, I don't give a fuck about it. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5124.72s)]
*  He's rescuing astronauts, he's [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5126.72s)]
*  sending Starlings around... [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5128.72s)]
*  No, don't get me wrong. Elon [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5130.72s)]
*  does amazing shit. America. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5132.72s)]
*  I don't think he drives his [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5134.72s)]
*  politic. But I think he does it the wrong way. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5136.72s)]
*  That's not why he's Republican all of a sudden. It's not about the [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5138.72s)]
*  welfare of America. He didn't buy Twitter [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5140.72s)]
*  because he's concerned about free speech. He bought Twitter [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5142.72s)]

*  Oh, I disagree. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5146.72s)]
*  I don't think that it's... [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5148.72s)]
*  I don't know the level [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5150.72s)]
*  of altruism, but I do think that he [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5152.72s)]
*  believes that this will be the most [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5154.72s)]

*  government representation for America. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5160.72s)]
*  I don't. What do you think it is? [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5162.72s)]
*  I think he wants to be... [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5164.72s)]
*  Twitter is impactful [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5166.72s)]
*  in a lot of [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5168.72s)]
*  countries, a lot of big countries. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5170.72s)]
*  And when you have [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5172.72s)]
*  control of the algorithm [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5174.72s)]

*  every head of state... [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5184.72s)]
*  So it's power? It's power. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5186.72s)]
*  It's 100% power. Can you elaborate on that a little bit more? [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5188.72s)]
*  I think... Yeah. That's an argument that I haven't heard. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5190.72s)]
*  You can curry favor from heads of state [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5192.72s)]
*  because you can control the narrative. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5194.72s)]
*  Explain that a little bit. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5196.72s)]
*  Please break that down. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5198.72s)]
*  You're folding the way that I did not expect. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5200.72s)]
*  He unfolded. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5202.72s)]
*  There was a judge in Brazil [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5204.72s)]
*  that said, Twitter is [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5206.72s)]
*  putting out misinformation in the country [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5208.72s)]
*  of Brazil. And they told him [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5210.72s)]
*  that he has to shut down [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5212.72s)]
*  or get fined. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5214.72s)]
*  And he said, fuck you, I'm not going to do it. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5216.72s)]
*  And then they shut him down. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5218.72s)]
*  And then time went on where he wasn't [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5220.72s)]
*  there and users started going elsewhere. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5222.72s)]
*  And so he [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5224.72s)]
*  acquiesced and paid his fine. And now they're back. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5226.72s)]
*  But he got to talk [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5228.72s)]
*  to the head of state [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5230.72s)]
*  of Brazil. He had dinner [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5232.72s)]
*  with the Prime Minister of Italy. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5234.72s)]
*  There's not anybody who's not going [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5236.72s)]
*  to take his fucking call. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5238.72s)]
*  I thought it was brilliant, right? [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5240.72s)]
*  From a net [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5242.72s)]
*  worth perspective, to spend [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5244.72s)]
*  44... And it wasn't all his money. I think he put in [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5246.72s)]
*  11 or 20 or whatever he [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5248.72s)]
*  put in, right? Stole a fuck ton of money. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5250.72s)]
*  But he bought access [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5252.72s)]
*  to everybody and anybody. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5254.72s)]
*  He also brought up a point on another podcast. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5256.72s)]
*  If you have... If you [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5258.72s)]
*  reply to someone on Twitter, [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5260.72s)]
*  everybody who follows you sees [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5262.72s)]
*  the tweet that you replied to. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5264.72s)]
*  Eon's the most followed person on Twitter. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5266.72s)]
*  It's not a coincidence that he always [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5268.72s)]
*  responds to random Republican tweets [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5270.72s)]
*  so everybody sees it. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5272.72s)]
*  I agree with you, his politics are very clear. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5274.72s)]
*  And I think a lot of people are kind of let down by it. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5276.72s)]
*  I like and love with his online personality. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5278.72s)]
*  But I do... I really respect him [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5280.72s)]
*  as an entrepreneur. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5282.72s)]
*  He's separating the online personality from the entrepreneur. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5284.72s)]
*  There's no way you can't just think [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5286.72s)]
*  Eon's amazing. He's a genius. Every which way. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5288.72s)]
*  There's no way he's the world. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5290.72s)]
*  Because you're someone who's had successes [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5292.72s)]
*  at the highest level. What do you [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5294.72s)]
*  think separates [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5296.72s)]
*  him? [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5298.72s)]
*  Is it his ability to hire? [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5300.72s)]
*  His ability to organize? [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5302.72s)]
*  What are the things that you look at? [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5304.72s)]
*  Vision and execution. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5306.72s)]
*  Lots of people can have a vision. I can talk about putting [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5308.72s)]
*  things over the streets, but I ain't going to do shit. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5310.72s)]
*  So it's the idea? [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5312.72s)]
*  Idea and follow through. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5314.72s)]
*  And then what is follow through? [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5316.72s)]
*  Is it specifically coming up with a plan? [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5318.72s)]
*  Is it hiring the right people to do it? [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5320.72s)]
*  It's willing to put it all on the line. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5322.72s)]
*  Because he went into debt, he didn't care. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5324.72s)]
*  He put up the money. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5326.72s)]
*  He's like, I'm all in. I don't give a fuck about the rest. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5328.72s)]
*  The way I grew up, [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5330.72s)]
*  I'm still cheap [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5332.72s)]
*  to a certain extent. Because that's the way I was raised. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5334.72s)]
*  My dad did upholstery on cars. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5336.72s)]
*  His dad [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5338.72s)]
*  was a waiter. My mom [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5340.72s)]
*  did odd jobs. Her dad [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5342.72s)]
*  just sold clothing door to door, [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5344.72s)]
*  literally, from car shop to car shop. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5346.72s)]
*  And they grew up [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5348.72s)]
*  in the depression and all that. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5350.72s)]
*  My mom still, till the day [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5352.72s)]
*  she died, but the cheapest [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5354.72s)]
*  dress from TJ Maxx. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5356.72s)]
*  I couldn't get her to buy anything nice. It was TJ [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5358.72s)]
*  Maxx. That was the way I [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5360.72s)]
*  was born. I'm always like, safe, safe, safe, safe, safe. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5362.72s)]
*  Elon's like, fuck it, go for it. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5364.72s)]
*  That's the skill. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5366.72s)]
*  That mentality allows you to take [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5368.72s)]
*  those big swings. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5370.72s)]
*  When I had nothing to lose, I could take a big swing [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5372.72s)]
*  because I had nothing to fucking lose. I'm sleeping on the floor. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5374.72s)]
*  I'm starving. It didn't matter. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5376.72s)]
*  And now I can take bigger swings. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5378.72s)]
*  But you're still thinking about it. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5380.72s)]
*  I'm still like, how am I going to protect myself in case [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5382.72s)]
*  the shit hits the fan? [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5384.72s)]
*  When I started Cost Plus, it cost [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5386.72s)]
*  a lot of money. But Elon [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5388.72s)]
*  put it all out. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5390.72s)]
*  Last piece of budget for the rocket [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5392.72s)]
*  launch for SpaceX, Tesla was [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5394.72s)]
*  his PayPal money. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5396.72s)]
*  Put it all on the line. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5398.72s)]
*  That's an interesting way of looking at it. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5400.72s)]
*  It's not like you're [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5402.72s)]
*  trying to avoid risk. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5404.72s)]
*  But it's almost like [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5406.72s)]
*  he has zero concern about risk. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5408.72s)]
*  Don't worry where that next hamburger is coming from. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5410.72s)]
*  At all. Interesting. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5412.72s)]
*  What do you think that is? [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5414.72s)]
*  He also [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5416.72s)]
*  had some money growing up. There might be a little bit more [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5418.72s)]
*  comfort with it. I don't know. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5420.72s)]
*  I don't want to discredit him. I hate when people do that. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5422.72s)]
*  I don't want to discredit [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5424.72s)]
*  him at all. Online, Elon [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5426.72s)]
*  is a prick. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5428.72s)]
*  He's the best. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5430.72s)]
*  He's going to change the future. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5432.72s)]
*  When you're speaking amongst your [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5434.72s)]
*  peers, the conversations you're having, I'm sure you [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5436.72s)]
*  guys have your version of Mount [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5438.72s)]
*  Rushmore, whatever it is, and the people [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5440.72s)]
*  that you probably think are overrated. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5442.72s)]
*  I'm actually curious what that is. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5444.72s)]
*  We can even cut them out if you want to feel comfortable. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5446.72s)]
*  I don't really pay attention enough. My boys are my [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5448.72s)]
*  boys. But are there any people that are in the [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5450.72s)]
*  entrepreneurship world that you look at and you're like, [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5452.72s)]
*  he gets all his credit, but he's fine? [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5454.72s)]
*  If you get to where people [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5456.72s)]
*  know who you are, you did something right. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5458.72s)]
*  I'm not going to nail on somebody [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5460.72s)]
*  that, except for Donald [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5462.72s)]
*  Trump. Literally, that's the example. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5464.72s)]
*  Interesting. Why him? [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5466.72s)]
*  Go through his list [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5468.72s)]
*  of where he got his money. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5470.72s)]
*  And tell me where he actually [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5472.72s)]
*  made it. Did he not earn it through real estate? [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5474.72s)]
*  I think his dad built all those [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5476.72s)]
*  buildings for him until he died. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5478.72s)]
*  After 1999, his [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5480.72s)]
*  biggest hit came from these [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5482.72s)]
*  three buildings that he defaulted [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5484.72s)]
*  on. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5486.72s)]
*  He did a deal that [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5488.72s)]
*  turns out to be right. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5490.72s)]
*  He said, if the value goes over a billion [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5492.72s)]
*  dollars, I'm losing these buildings. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5494.72s)]
*  But to keep me from suing you and just [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5496.72s)]
*  making a big stink in the media, [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5498.72s)]
*  if you sell [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5500.72s)]
*  them for more than a billion dollars, [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5502.72s)]
*  I want 30 percent. And the buildings [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5504.72s)]
*  were worth like 200 million. And they were like, [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5506.72s)]
*  fuck it, whatever. We never thought they would be. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5508.72s)]
*  They went over. Real estate in New York [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5510.72s)]
*  goes nuts. They went over. That's where he got [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5512.72s)]
*  his next tranche of money. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5514.72s)]
*  And then the other thing he did that was smart, and I'll give him credit [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5516.72s)]
*  for, is [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5518.72s)]
*  in a golf club, like I said, I'm not a golfer, [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5520.72s)]
*  you put down a deposit to join the club. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5522.72s)]
*  And that deposit [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5524.72s)]
*  is supposed to be there so that when somebody [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5526.72s)]
*  leaves the club, you get your money back. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5528.72s)]
*  Do you belong to any golf club? [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5530.72s)]
*  No, but I'm familiar with this. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5532.72s)]
*  So what he did that was... [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5534.72s)]
*  It's not a payment. A lot of people think it is a payment. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5536.72s)]
*  But they essentially are holding that money. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5538.72s)]
*  It's a deposit. It's a deposit you're supposed to get back when you leave the club. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5540.72s)]
*  Well, what he did was a little janky, [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5542.72s)]
*  but he did it, and they got sued, [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5544.72s)]
*  and it got approved in the courts. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5546.72s)]
*  He said, I'm just going to use that money [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5548.72s)]
*  for whatever I want. So he operated like a bank? [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5550.72s)]
*  Well, he didn't lend it out. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5552.72s)]
*  He used it for himself. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5554.72s)]
*  So he said, I'm taking [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5556.72s)]
*  the... [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5558.72s)]
*  which was smart in so many respects. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5560.72s)]
*  Janky, but smart. He said, [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5562.72s)]
*  I want to buy this golf course. It has [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5564.72s)]
*  100 million in deposits. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5566.72s)]
*  If I could just get control of the golf course [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5568.72s)]
*  for whatever amount, even if I have [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5570.72s)]
*  to borrow, then I take the deposits [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5572.72s)]
*  and I make use of it. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5574.72s)]
*  Now that's my money to use for whatever I want. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5576.72s)]
*  And if Andrew [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5578.72s)]
*  leaves the golf course, I'll just give him the 250 [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5580.72s)]
*  grand from his deposit, and it don't matter. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5582.72s)]
*  So he actually... [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5584.72s)]
*  Oh, fuck me. It's not everybody's going to leave [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5586.72s)]
*  at the same time, and as long as I make the golf course [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5588.72s)]
*  amazing... Look that shit up and see... [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5590.72s)]
*  So if he invested... [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5592.72s)]
*  He's smart. He's smart. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5594.72s)]
*  If he puts it in the fucking money market, he's making money [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5596.72s)]
*  on 100 million, and he's paying out every day. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5598.72s)]
*  Did he not pay somebody out? [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5600.72s)]
*  No, it's not that he got caught. It's just [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5602.72s)]
*  the members of the club he did [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5604.72s)]
*  it to first said, I want that deposit [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5606.72s)]
*  there. I don't want to trust you to find the money [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5608.72s)]
*  to give me my deposit back. How did he even know that he was investing it? [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5610.72s)]
*  Well, he was taking over the club. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5612.72s)]
*  So when he took over the club, he didn't say, by the way, [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5614.72s)]
*  I'm going to take over all your deposits. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5616.72s)]
*  But he had to, right? Because the money... [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5618.72s)]
*  Oh, the people... You know how there's a board... [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5620.72s)]
*  Oh, got it, got it, got it. So they found out. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5622.72s)]
*  On one end, it was smart as fuck. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5624.72s)]
*  Like I said, [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5626.72s)]
*  the settle suit from former members sinking [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5628.72s)]
*  refunds. What year was that? I can't [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5630.72s)]
*  see that. 2018. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5632.72s)]
*  Okay, that's when the suit settled. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5634.72s)]
*  So if you buy a golf course... And I'm not saying you can, [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5636.72s)]
*  but if you bought a golf course for 50 [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5638.72s)]
*  million dollars, but it had 100 [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5640.72s)]
*  million that are just sitting there. Hello. You got paid 50 million to buy the golf course. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5642.72s)]
*  That's a smart fucking move. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5644.72s)]
*  He found a little delta. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5646.72s)]
*  What did I just say, right? Janky, but [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5648.72s)]
*  smart. Yeah. But you [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5650.72s)]
*  said, where's he getting his money? Yeah. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5652.72s)]
*  Any other [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5654.72s)]
*  entrepreneurs coming up that you're looking [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5656.72s)]
*  at? You're like, I think this guy's really got it. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5658.72s)]
*  There's... [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5660.72s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of them. It's just like with [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5662.72s)]
*  AI right now. Kevin O'Leary, maybe? [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5664.72s)]
*  No. I love Kevin O'Leary. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5666.72s)]
*  No, I'm not going to him for entrepreneur. I mean, [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5668.72s)]
*  Sam Altman is doing some interesting [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5670.72s)]
*  things, but he's like [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5672.72s)]
*  getting into like all kinds of bullshit, [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5674.72s)]
*  which you don't want to necessarily get into. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5676.72s)]
*  Yeah. Can you break [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5678.72s)]
*  that down? How they're getting... I don't know all the details. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5680.72s)]
*  Oh, okay. Here's a question. What's your [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5682.72s)]
*  superpower? Why is it [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5684.72s)]
*  you come from modest means, not poor, [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5686.72s)]
*  but modest, and then you're a billionaire [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5688.72s)]
*  multiple times over. How? What [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5690.72s)]
*  do you think your greatest strength is? So [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5692.72s)]
*  I love to learn. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5694.72s)]
*  So when it comes to business, I'll [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5696.72s)]
*  read, learn anybody. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5698.72s)]
*  Like I'll read everything, everything. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5700.72s)]
*  And then I'm good at saying, [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5702.72s)]
*  okay, here's what I know. Steve Jobs [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5704.72s)]
*  said everything is a remix. And I take that [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5706.72s)]
*  to heart. You just said, here's where [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5708.72s)]
*  we are. Here's everything I know. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5710.72s)]
*  What's next? So it's like the [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5712.72s)]
*  overpass on the roads. Okay, [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5714.72s)]
*  what's a way to solve this [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5716.72s)]
*  problem? It's like CostPlusDrugs.com. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5718.72s)]
*  It's an opaque industry. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5720.72s)]
*  Everybody says you can't fix [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5722.72s)]
*  drug pricing. I'm like, [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5724.72s)]
*  what's missing? No [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5726.72s)]
*  transparency. So I'm going to make all of [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5728.72s)]
*  our prices transparent. I'm going to publish [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5730.72s)]
*  our price list so everybody can see it. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5732.72s)]
*  And it's been the easiest industry to [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5734.72s)]
*  disrupt I've ever been involved with. And so [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5736.72s)]
*  my superpower is being able to look at [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5738.72s)]
*  something and say, here's what I know. Here's what [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5740.72s)]
*  I think we can do. Can we do it? [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5742.72s)]
*  Yes or no. And then just going [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5744.72s)]
*  for it. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5746.72s)]
*  And I think other than that, I can sell [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5748.72s)]
*  like a motherfucker. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5750.72s)]
*  I work my ass off. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5752.72s)]
*  And I'm not afraid to fail. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5754.72s)]
*  That's great. I mean, it scares me. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5756.72s)]
*  But I'll work [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5758.72s)]
*  my ass off so that, I mean, [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5760.72s)]
*  you guys, you guys started this. It takes balls [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5762.72s)]
*  to do this. Everybody says no. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5764.72s)]
*  It can't work. Yeah, for sure it's scary. Yeah, it's [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5766.72s)]
*  scary as fuck. But that makes you work harder. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5768.72s)]
*  100%. Sorry, follow up about [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5770.72s)]
*  the CostPlusDrugs health insurance. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5772.72s)]
*  Do you have any ideas on how you can disrupt [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5774.72s)]
*  that industry? Oh yeah, just stay tuned. Okay, I [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5776.72s)]
*  love that. I'm very excited about this. Why haven't you [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5778.72s)]
*  made deals with the insurance companies so [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5780.72s)]
*  they just start buying? Because they're fucked. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5782.72s)]
*  They're fucked. So insurance companies, [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5784.72s)]
*  most [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5786.72s)]
*  people who have health insurance [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5788.72s)]
*  have it through an employer who's self-insured. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5790.72s)]
*  Yeah. And so you know what [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5792.72s)]
*  self-insurance is, right? Where the employer pays the bills. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5794.72s)]
*  Yeah. But that's not traditional insurance. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5796.72s)]
*  The idea of insurance, like your car insurance, [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5798.72s)]
*  right? If you get in a wreck, your car insurance gives you [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5800.72s)]
*  money. But with health insurance, [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5802.72s)]
*  for most people, their employer [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5804.72s)]
*  self-insures. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5806.72s)]
*  And so that means what the fuck does an [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5808.72s)]
*  insurance company do if they're not [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5810.72s)]
*  insuring? It sounds like they're not taking any risk at all. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5812.72s)]
*  None whatsoever. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5814.72s)]
*  It's a pretty sweet business to be in, huh? Yes. And so [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5816.72s)]
*  all they do is they process the paperwork. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5818.72s)]
*  And they take nickels and dimes here [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5820.72s)]
*  and there. Some from the hospital, some [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5822.72s)]
*  from the employer, some from the patient [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5824.72s)]
*  with a deductible or a co-pay. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5826.72s)]
*  And that all adds up to a [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5828.72s)]
*  fuck ton of money. We're saying, just like [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5830.72s)]
*  we did with drugs, we'll get to this point where [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5832.72s)]
*  we're going to publish all of our contracts [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5834.72s)]
*  so everybody knows what to do. And we're going to cut [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5836.72s)]
*  out the insurance company completely and just [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5838.72s)]
*  go to the provider, whoever provides [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5840.72s)]
*  the healthcare. And I'll just do a contract with you [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5842.72s)]
*  because the providers hate [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5844.72s)]
*  the fucking insurance companies as much as we do. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5846.72s)]
*  You know what's funny? The insurance company is almost like a [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5848.72s)]
*  money manager in that they're just taking a [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5850.72s)]
*  scrape. They're not taking the risk. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5852.72s)]
*  Commissioned sales is all they are. They're commission sales. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5854.72s)]
*  We're going to go sign up this company, this company, [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5856.72s)]
*  this company. And hospital, if you want [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5858.72s)]
*  access to their employees for their shit, [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5860.72s)]
*  here's what we're going to pay you. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5862.72s)]
*  And we're going to be a sales funnel. They're just commission sales. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5864.72s)]
*  Isn't that fucked? It is totally fucked. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5866.72s)]
*  I still don't get why wouldn't [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5868.72s)]
*  they be incentivized to buy meds [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5870.72s)]
*  from you if they can get meds from you for cheaper? [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5872.72s)]
*  Because they make more money [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5874.72s)]
*  buying the cheapest [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5876.72s)]
*  isn't not how they make their most money. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5878.72s)]
*  They make their most money by saying [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5880.72s)]
*  that we're saving you [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5882.72s)]
*  money and we're doing all these things, but we're [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5884.72s)]
*  not showing you the actual information. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5886.72s)]
*  So if you think [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5888.72s)]
*  that, like if they came to Cost Plus Drugs [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5890.72s)]
*  and something cost a hundred bucks, but [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5892.72s)]
*  you don't know what the price of it really is [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5894.72s)]
*  and they charge you three hundred [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5896.72s)]
*  because you don't know what the price is. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5898.72s)]
*  They make more money. In other words, like [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5900.72s)]
*  they're getting the drug for the same price [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5902.72s)]
*  he is. Well, they may even be [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5904.72s)]
*  paying more. They may even pay more [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5906.72s)]
*  than what we pay, but they don't care. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5908.72s)]
*  But their delta is crazy. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5910.72s)]
*  Because the people don't know the real [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5912.72s)]
*  price of the drug. That's all they care about. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5914.72s)]
*  They care about money. They could still even make a little bit more [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5916.72s)]
*  by saving a little bit more. The spray could be a little bit more, but [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5918.72s)]
*  they don't want anybody to know what they're doing. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5920.72s)]
*  So they don't let the drug companies take a little bit higher [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5922.72s)]
*  amount. That's actually brilliant. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5924.72s)]
*  Hey, none of these people know it's ten cents. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5926.72s)]
*  I'll give you a dollar. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5928.72s)]
*  Well, it's actually this place is called PBMs, Pharmacy Benefit [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5930.72s)]
*  Managers, who act as the middleman [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5932.72s)]
*  who do that. So they say, [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5934.72s)]
*  OK, manufacturer, I'm going to [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5936.72s)]
*  give you two hundred bucks, [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5938.72s)]
*  but you're going to give me a rebate [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5940.72s)]
*  of a hundred and fifty. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5942.72s)]
*  And then I'm going to tell everybody I paid two hundred bucks. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5944.72s)]
*  And then [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5946.72s)]
*  there's like four different [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5948.72s)]
*  middlemen that are eating off the same thing. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5950.72s)]
*  Oh, it's so fucked up. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5952.72s)]
*  It is so fucked up. But that's [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5954.72s)]
*  opportunity. That's like where [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5956.72s)]
*  Elon is going out. You really need security, bro. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5958.72s)]
*  Yeah, you really need security. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5960.72s)]
*  That's a honeypot. That's a [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5962.72s)]
*  giant honeypot that you're disrupting. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5964.72s)]
*  But that is [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5966.72s)]
*  Jesus Christ. What an absolute [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5968.72s)]
*  mindfuck. It's a scam. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5970.72s)]
*  How many people do you think actually [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5972.72s)]
*  knows Americans understand how the [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5974.72s)]
*  insurance industry, the medical insurance industry. Well, it's more and more now [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5976.72s)]
*  because just recently the [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5978.72s)]
*  FTC started going after [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5980.72s)]
*  the motherfuckers and just [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5982.72s)]
*  inspired that. I think we [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5984.72s)]
*  did because we put out the first price [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5986.72s)]
*  list where like there is [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5988.72s)]
*  researchers that are saying, look, if Medicare [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5990.72s)]
*  insurance companies that work [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5992.72s)]
*  with Medicare bought through Cost Plus, [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5994.72s)]
*  these nine drugs would save taxpayers [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5996.72s)]
*  three point six billion dollars. And [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=5998.72s)]
*  then they just did a report from the FTC [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6000.72s)]
*  where they used our pricing to say [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6002.72s)]
*  these PBMs, the middlemen, they're ripping [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6004.72s)]
*  off people left and right. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6006.72s)]
*  And so I mean, we fucking [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6008.72s)]
*  no doubt, absolutely no doubt [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6010.72s)]
*  that we were right there because it all [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6012.72s)]
*  started when we started releasing our price list. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6014.72s)]
*  So what happens when [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6016.72s)]
*  all those companies just adjust their [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6018.72s)]
*  prices to yours? They're toast. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6020.72s)]
*  Why? Because then all of a sudden [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6022.72s)]
*  these public companies that have a hundred billion dollars in [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6024.72s)]
*  sales have a fourth of those [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6026.72s)]
*  that's the price. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6028.72s)]
*  Should we be shorting those companies [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6030.72s)]
*  right now? It's worth taking a look. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6032.72s)]
*  Now, I'm not saying you're doing this. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6034.72s)]
*  I'm not. But [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6036.72s)]
*  this is brilliant. I'm not saying you're doing this. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6042.72s)]
*  But you know how the NBA [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6044.72s)]
*  teams, they want to build a new [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6046.72s)]
*  arena, but they'll own all the real estate around [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6048.72s)]
*  it so that they could benefit from [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6050.72s)]
*  developing that area, right? It would [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6052.72s)]
*  be genius if there was a person that [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6054.72s)]
*  saw a white space or saw a [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6056.72s)]
*  super inflated or bureaucratic market [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6058.72s)]
*  like, you know, the insurance business [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6060.72s)]
*  and shorted all the companies [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6062.72s)]
*  and then developed something [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6064.72s)]
*  that would cause them to take. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6066.72s)]
*  It's not that I didn't think of it. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6068.72s)]
*  The problem isn't the shorting. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6070.72s)]
*  I'm doing it. I used to make a [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6072.72s)]
*  fuck ton of money shorting companies like, oh, [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6074.72s)]
*  you have no idea. I started this company called [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6076.72s)]
*  sharesleuth.com and it's still in [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6078.72s)]
*  business today, but it's a lot smaller. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6080.72s)]
*  And I hired this guy to just go [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6082.72s)]
*  out and find public information, only public [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6084.72s)]
*  information about bullshit companies [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6086.72s)]
*  because there's all these bullshit companies. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6088.72s)]
*  The ones that have $100, $200, $500 million [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6090.72s)]
*  market caps. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6092.72s)]
*  He would find companies that were putting out [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6094.72s)]
*  press releases about this new warehouse [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6096.72s)]
*  they opened, and so he would send somebody [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6098.72s)]
*  to the warehouse. No utilities, [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6100.72s)]
*  nobody there, all [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6102.72s)]
*  that shit. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6104.72s)]
*  Oh my God, I just killed it. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6106.72s)]
*  Just killed it. And I would tell them [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6108.72s)]
*  like, I'm sure they would publish [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6110.72s)]
*  the article and it would say, this is Mark Cuban's [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6112.72s)]
*  short position, and [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6114.72s)]
*  just killed it. Because they were fraudulent [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6116.72s)]
*  companies. Frauds. 100% fraud. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6118.72s)]
*  And he just called it out and just waited. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6120.72s)]
*  Now with this insurance thing, you'd have to [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6122.72s)]
*  make sure you can take down the insurance companies. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6124.72s)]
*  Because they're big and they're not stupid. And so [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6126.72s)]
*  they're going to react and come [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6128.72s)]
*  up with different ideas. Fuck. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6130.72s)]
*  Are there any other sectors [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6132.72s)]
*  that you'd like to get? Actually, let me ask [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6134.72s)]
*  a better question. What else do you think that [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6136.72s)]
*  you could be instrumental in fixing on a [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6138.72s)]
*  government level? Oh, I mean, just [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6140.72s)]
*  like Trump was talking about with Elon, it's just [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6142.72s)]
*  common sense to fix a lot of that shit. But I think [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6144.72s)]
*  what's being missed is you don't just [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6146.72s)]
*  cut. Like we talked about Vivek. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6148.72s)]
*  Vivek says you just cut out [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6150.72s)]
*  the Department of Education, give it to the states. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6152.72s)]
*  You can't do that for all the reasons I mentioned. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6154.72s)]
*  You got to say, I look at it [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6156.72s)]
*  and say, what's the problem we're trying to solve? [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6158.72s)]
*  We're trying to get more results to the [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6160.72s)]
*  people who need them. But like, give me another one. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6162.72s)]
*  Do you look at education and go, okay, I can fix that? [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6164.72s)]
*  Yeah, okay. So education, [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6166.72s)]
*  I would love [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6168.72s)]
*  to start a fucking college. I just don't have [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6170.72s)]
*  the time to do it. Where you [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6172.72s)]
*  set it up, like colleges today, [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6174.72s)]
*  they're paying administrators [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6176.72s)]
*  $200,000 and up, [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6178.72s)]
*  and they're paying professors [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6180.72s)]
*  less than that, and they're paying the [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6182.72s)]
*  TAs that actually teach the class [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6184.72s)]
*  of the teaching assistants minimum wage. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6186.72s)]
*  And they fucking have, [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6188.72s)]
*  they spend more money on sports, they send [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6190.72s)]
*  more money on the fucking [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6192.72s)]
*  cafeterias and all this [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6194.72s)]
*  other shit. The amenities, yeah. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6196.72s)]
*  And kids pick schools because the tailgating [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6198.72s)]
*  and the football games are better. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6200.72s)]
*  I'm like, how cool would it be [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6202.72s)]
*  if I had the time to start a business school [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6204.72s)]
*  where I set all the curriculum [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6206.72s)]
*  and all this, but the problem, the challenge is [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6208.72s)]
*  you have to go through this accreditation [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6210.72s)]
*  process. And that's all [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6212.72s)]
*  the old school fuck you type guys [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6214.72s)]
*  that are just going to say, we ain't going to do [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6216.72s)]
*  that for you because I checked. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6218.72s)]
*  There's like a boys club you're [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6220.72s)]
*  saying essentially? Yeah, getting [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6222.72s)]
*  accreditation is a beast. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6224.72s)]
*  And you don't like to schmooze with the politicians? [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6226.72s)]
*  No, I'm not going to do that shit. No. Now the question [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6228.72s)]
*  then becomes you just start it and go to companies [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6230.72s)]
*  and say, it's not accredited, [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6232.72s)]
*  but it's a degree. It's not Trump University, [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6234.72s)]
*  but it's a real degree, [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6236.72s)]
*  real thought, real smarts. And [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6238.72s)]
*  you make it so that [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6240.72s)]
*  kids really learn and are prepared [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6242.72s)]
*  to go out and do stuff. But most importantly, [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6244.72s)]
*  you price it at a cost plus [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6246.72s)]
*  basis. I think this is [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6248.72s)]
*  happening already organically [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6250.72s)]
*  on the internet, not [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6252.72s)]
*  as an education system. Right, because you get [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6254.72s)]
*  all the videos and yeah, that's why I talk myself. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6256.72s)]
*  I think DIY, DIY, DIY [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6258.72s)]
*  projects and people are like [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6260.72s)]
*  developing homes. Oh, YouTube [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6262.72s)]
*  University is a thing. Yeah, it really is. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6264.72s)]
*  So I think the next step of that would be an [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6266.72s)]
*  organized version of it. Pull it all together. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6268.72s)]
*  But make it so [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6270.72s)]
*  they cover all the bases and you [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6272.72s)]
*  have a curriculum and they have [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6274.72s)]
*  to graduate, but it's a thousand [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6276.72s)]
*  dollars a year. And then I literally [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6278.72s)]
*  thought about, and I even talked to people in Dallas, [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6280.72s)]
*  I'm like, okay, what if I took over a community [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6282.72s)]
*  college? Made [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6284.72s)]
*  it free, did all the curriculum [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6286.72s)]
*  and made it two years, but it'd be a [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6288.72s)]
*  bad ass two years. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6290.72s)]
*  Okay, you could change shit like that. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6292.72s)]
*  You could take Brookhaven. That's not [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6294.72s)]
*  what I'm saying, right? [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6296.72s)]
*  You know, school. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6298.72s)]
*  And so you could [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6300.72s)]
*  do that. And then the other thing is like, how do [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6302.72s)]
*  you reduce the cost of colleges? And so [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6304.72s)]
*  they're like, you know, the Democrats are like, we're going to [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6306.72s)]
*  make college free. Fuck, you don't do that. Because [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6308.72s)]
*  then it's just like when [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6310.72s)]
*  people can borrow all the money they want [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6312.72s)]
*  to pay for school because they'll give you [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6314.72s)]
*  all you want because you can't bankruptcy your way [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6316.72s)]
*  out of it. So when you have [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6318.72s)]
*  all that money coming in, tuition [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6320.72s)]
*  goes up. Yeah. You're incentivizing [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6322.72s)]
*  the schools to charge more. Right. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6324.72s)]
*  Because there's no downside to them. They don't have [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6326.72s)]
*  to deal with it if someone goes broke or can't [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6328.72s)]
*  pay for it. But [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6330.72s)]
*  if you said, okay, I'm all for [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6332.72s)]
*  having free college for people who can't afford [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6334.72s)]
*  it. But what I would say is [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6336.72s)]
*  you put out to bid in every [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6338.72s)]
*  city area, right? Every [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6340.72s)]
*  like DFW, the New [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6342.72s)]
*  York Tri-State area. And you say one college [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6344.72s)]
*  is going to be free. Just one. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6346.72s)]
*  The rest of you, you know, you all [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6348.72s)]
*  can bid, but I'm going to pick one [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6350.72s)]
*  that's free and we're going to do a 10 year [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6352.72s)]
*  or 20 year contract and it's [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6354.72s)]
*  free. And there's going to be a limited number of students [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6356.72s)]
*  because of the size. Now the people [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6358.72s)]
*  who really need to go to the free school [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6360.72s)]
*  can go to it and get free college. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6362.72s)]
*  But the more important thing is [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6364.72s)]
*  by having a free college, it [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6366.72s)]
*  limits what everybody else is going to charge [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6368.72s)]
*  in the Tri-State area because they know [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6370.72s)]
*  they're competing for free. So they have [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6372.72s)]
*  to be better and they can't be too expensive. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6374.72s)]
*  But if there's a limit amount of [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6376.72s)]
*  people who can go to that school and we want [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6378.72s)]
*  everybody to go to college. You can always [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6380.72s)]
*  add a second one or third one. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6382.72s)]
*  But at least a start. So you have something to keep costs down. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6384.72s)]
*  You have a competitor essentially [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6386.72s)]
*  that's affordable, which is the idea of [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6388.72s)]
*  the city or state college system. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6390.72s)]
*  And it's not bad. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6392.72s)]
*  Like New York and LA are not bad [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6394.72s)]
*  as states. Yeah, California has a good state school [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6396.72s)]
*  and New York has a good state school system. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6398.72s)]
*  Yeah, that is [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6400.72s)]
*  interesting. But you're basically saying [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6402.72s)]
*  not every state has that. No. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6404.72s)]
*  So you end up going to one of these behemoth universities [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6406.72s)]
*  that's got 40 different pools [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6408.72s)]
*  for you to go swim at. You're spending 50 grand a year. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6410.72s)]
*  You're not really getting education. You go to it. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6412.72s)]
*  I'm going to Alabama because the football is great. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6414.72s)]
*  I'm going to Georgia because the football. Maybe the [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6416.72s)]
*  education is great there. I don't know. But [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6418.72s)]
*  it's still expensive and you're still paying [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6420.72s)]
*  for all those amenities. And the prices [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6422.72s)]
*  keep inflating because they know you'll pay it. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6424.72s)]
*  You can get loans. Yeah, that's a good question. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6426.72s)]
*  How do we fix inflation? There's so [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6428.72s)]
*  much conversation about inflation right now. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6430.72s)]
*  Inflation is fixed. The problem is the [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6432.72s)]
*  prices that are already up are already up. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6434.72s)]
*  And so what you have to do, there's only [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6436.72s)]
*  a couple things you can do. What do you mean by [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6438.72s)]
*  it's fixed? In other words, the inflation [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6440.72s)]
*  rate is like 2. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6442.72s)]
*  So it's readjusted. So it popped up to 12% [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6444.72s)]
*  or whatever. 9% and it's come right back [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6446.72s)]
*  down. And how do we tell that? What is the indicator? [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6448.72s)]
*  By the consumer price [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6450.72s)]
*  index. And so the increase from [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6452.72s)]
*  one year in the consumer price index, if it goes up [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6454.72s)]
*  9% year over year, inflation is 9%. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6456.72s)]
*  If it goes up [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6458.72s)]
*  2.3% year over year, inflation is [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6460.72s)]
*  2.3%. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6462.72s)]
*  Going back to what I talked about when [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6464.72s)]
*  the decision on the pricing of oil [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6466.72s)]
*  and gas. Remember when I said Trump [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6468.72s)]
*  convinced them to reduce [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6470.72s)]
*  production? That pushed [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6472.72s)]
*  up the price of gas, which made everything else [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6474.72s)]
*  expensive, which then pushed up the [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6476.72s)]
*  prices of things. But now we are where we are. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6478.72s)]
*  So it's not about what happened before. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6480.72s)]
*  And in order to overcome [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6482.72s)]
*  that, you can't all of a sudden say, [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6484.72s)]
*  OK, sell those tomatoes for less. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6486.72s)]
*  You can't say, all right, I'm going [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6488.72s)]
*  to reduce the cost of [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6490.72s)]
*  energy or gas. And it's going down [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6492.72s)]
*  because people aren't, you know, Trump says [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6494.72s)]
*  drill, drill, drill. Well, we've already [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6496.72s)]
*  been through that before where if there's [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6498.72s)]
*  too much drilling, the [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6500.72s)]
*  price craters, if the price craters, [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6502.72s)]
*  they're going to stop drilling. Now question. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6504.72s)]
*  So let me go back. Before I lose [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6506.72s)]
*  this train of thought. Please go. So you're not going [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6508.72s)]
*  to all of a sudden say, here's how we're going to reduce the price of tomatoes, [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6510.72s)]
*  eggs or whatever. So what you have [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6513.72s)]
*  to do is say, how are people going to make [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6515.72s)]
*  more money? Because if [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6517.72s)]
*  when it was like this, everybody's in [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6519.72s)]
*  pain because prices went up [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6521.72s)]
*  too fast and you go to the grocery store and [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6523.72s)]
*  you're freaked out by what you see. And then [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6525.72s)]
*  you look and you look at your paycheck [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6527.72s)]
*  and you're like, fuck, it's not keeping up. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6529.72s)]
*  And so the only way to [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6531.72s)]
*  change that is when you look at that paycheck [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6533.72s)]
*  and say, inflate salary as well. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6535.72s)]
*  Yeah. And so are you giving [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6537.72s)]
*  those raises? So if you [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6539.72s)]
*  were making a thousand [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6541.72s)]
*  bucks a week and your [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6543.72s)]
*  grocery bill went from five hundred [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6545.72s)]
*  to six hundred, that's pain. If you're [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6547.72s)]
*  making a thousand dollars a week and [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6549.72s)]
*  it goes to twelve hundred and your grocery [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6551.72s)]
*  bill goes from five hundred to six hundred [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6553.72s)]
*  a month or whatever, right? Now you're good. You're good. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6555.72s)]
*  So you've got to get those earnings [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6557.72s)]
*  up. So just I think, okay, [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6559.72s)]
*  so basically what we have to do is [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6561.72s)]
*  accept that this is where the dollar is. In [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6563.72s)]
*  other words, we're not going to bring down [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6565.72s)]
*  the buying power of the dollar, bring, I guess, [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6567.72s)]
*  up the buying power. It's not so much the buying power of the [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6569.72s)]
*  dollar because it's domestic. Right. And so [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6571.72s)]
*  in inflation, [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6573.72s)]
*  yeah, so it's not a hundred percent sure. I'm wrong a little bit. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6575.72s)]
*  So with inflation, when inflation [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6577.72s)]
*  goes up, your buying power relative to the past [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6579.72s)]
*  has declined. Yeah. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6581.72s)]
*  And so you're not going to really change that [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6583.72s)]
*  dynamic, but you get more dollars. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6585.72s)]
*  So it's basically easier to adjust [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6587.72s)]
*  wages than it is to bring [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6589.72s)]
*  down the price. Because if you're a manufacturer [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6591.72s)]
*  of widgets or whatever, [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6593.72s)]
*  you're like, I'm not going to start charging less. Like everybody accepted. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6595.72s)]
*  It's eight bucks now. Right. Now maybe like if [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6597.72s)]
*  no one's buying it, like when these reducer [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6599.72s)]
*  price McDonald's came out. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6601.72s)]
*  But that, so this is [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6603.72s)]
*  an interesting, this is why you got to talk to like economists [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6605.72s)]
*  about this, because the fact that people are [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6607.72s)]
*  not buying as many widgets or whatever [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6609.72s)]
*  it is because they're not making as much money is going [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6611.72s)]
*  to force them to reduce those prices again. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6613.72s)]
*  On certain things. On certain things. You can't [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6615.72s)]
*  grocery, you got to have eggs. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6617.72s)]
*  Well, to what he was saying is that now [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6619.72s)]
*  basically there's a delta that has happened [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6621.72s)]
*  since inflation. Now that that inflation has been [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6623.72s)]
*  reduced, we haven't reduced those prices. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6625.72s)]
*  Therefore, they're just making more money. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6627.72s)]
*  Well, it's not that their costs probably went up too. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6629.72s)]
*  And so their cost to do everything probably [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6631.72s)]
*  went up. And so when there's inflation, [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6633.72s)]
*  it's not just the things that consumers buy. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6635.72s)]
*  It's the inputs that go into making [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6637.72s)]
*  those widgets. Of course. Everything is more. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6639.72s)]
*  It all goes up. So some companies, like I've [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6641.72s)]
*  been in these conversations, hey, [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6643.72s)]
*  inflation's up. We can charge more [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6645.72s)]
*  even if our costs didn't go up. And that's the gouging. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6647.72s)]
*  It's not so much. It's just what companies do. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6649.72s)]
*  And that's just what's the dance with the [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6651.72s)]
*  Fed interest rate that affects [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6653.72s)]
*  prices. So when [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6655.72s)]
*  Fed interest rates go up high [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6657.72s)]
*  enough, then it's harder [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6659.72s)]
*  to borrow money [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6661.72s)]
*  to invest in things. Less liquidity, [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6663.72s)]
*  less investment. Right. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6665.72s)]
*  And then like, but when investment, [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6667.72s)]
*  when interest rates are really low, like they [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6669.72s)]
*  were for one or two percent, then anybody [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6671.72s)]
*  can say, fuck, I can make more than one or two percent. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6673.72s)]
*  And so I'll buy a bunch of stuff. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6675.72s)]
*  And then when you're in the market, you're [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6677.72s)]
*  going to make more than one or two percent. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6679.72s)]
*  And so I'll borrow, borrow, borrow, bill, bill, bill, bill. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6681.72s)]
*  Essentially money was free. Money was free. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6683.72s)]
*  So why do they, if inflation [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6685.72s)]
*  was so high, why did they wait so long to [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6687.72s)]
*  bring that? Because they had to wait until things [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6689.72s)]
*  slowed down. Because the reason [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6691.72s)]
*  inflation went down is [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6693.72s)]
*  because it was harder for people to get money, [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6695.72s)]
*  for people to borrow money in that case, [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6697.72s)]
*  and banks were less likely [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6699.72s)]
*  to lend money, then less [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6701.72s)]
*  money got down to the consumers. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6703.72s)]
*  They spent less, so people had less [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6705.72s)]
*  ability to raise prices. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6707.72s)]
*  Companies had less ability to raise prices. When there's less spending, they're buying [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6709.72s)]
*  less, then all of a sudden the stores start going, [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6711.72s)]
*  we've got to reduce prices because nobody's buying. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6713.72s)]
*  What causes essentially [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6715.72s)]
*  inflation is, not this is the cause, but [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6717.72s)]
*  there's more money than there are things to buy. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6719.72s)]
*  And that's when the currency just... Supply and demand. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6721.72s)]
*  But that's an interesting way to do it. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6723.72s)]
*  When you make money essentially free, like [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6725.72s)]
*  I'm too economically illiterate to realize it, [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6727.72s)]
*  but in that time when it was free, [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6729.72s)]
*  like you could get it for one percent, what was it, [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6731.72s)]
*  one and a half percent. Yeah, like that's when Bitcoin [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6733.72s)]
*  and a lot of crypto went up because fuck, I'll buy Bitcoin. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6735.72s)]
*  Take out the one and a half percent, I'll buy Bitcoin [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6737.72s)]
*  and I'm going to make what, thirty percent whenever it's going crazy? [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6739.72s)]
*  Alright guys, let's take a break for a second. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6741.72s)]

*  Sometimes you get wrongfully injured [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6851.72s)]
*  because of somebody else's negligence, maybe [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6853.72s)]
*  I don't know, malfeasance. That shit sucks. You got to [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6855.72s)]

*  dime you for everything. You're in pain. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6859.72s)]

*  out Morgan & Morgan pretty easily and get a claim [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6867.72s)]

*  increasing wages. Is that, it seems like a very [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6923.72s)]
*  easy solution. Is that something you can just do? [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6925.72s)]
*  Increase wages? Yeah. Because if you're, to your point [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6927.72s)]
*  though, if it costs these guys more to make [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6929.72s)]
*  the goods because of inflation, [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6931.72s)]
*  then you're asking them to also pay extra wages. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6933.72s)]
*  Does it not put strain on them? [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6935.72s)]
*  As the employer? Well, it depends if you're selling enough, right? [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6937.72s)]
*  But it comes down to, like, anybody [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6939.72s)]
*  here, if they're good and you want [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6941.72s)]
*  to keep them and they want to stay ahead of inflation, [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6943.72s)]
*  they're coming in. Cut this off. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6945.72s)]
*  They're coming in [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6947.72s)]
*  and saying, [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6949.72s)]
*  but like Tacoma Harris's credit, [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6951.72s)]
*  she's saying we're going to increase minimum wage. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6953.72s)]
*  Because if you're on, you know, the national [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6955.72s)]
*  minimum wage, it's different here in New York. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6957.72s)]
*  National minimum wage is $7.15. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6959.72s)]
*  There ain't nobody, you know. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6961.72s)]
*  They can live on self-inflation. Yeah. Now, if you're just a kid, [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6963.72s)]
*  maybe whatever, but if you're 16 and working [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6965.72s)]
*  in fast food, [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6967.72s)]
*  okay. But, like, [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6969.72s)]
*  that's how you do it. And if you index [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6971.72s)]
*  the minimum wage to inflation, [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6973.72s)]
*  then everybody has a chance to keep up. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6975.72s)]
*  And so, you can't, [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6977.72s)]
*  I think she's made a mistake by talking [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6979.72s)]
*  about gouging. Price [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6981.72s)]
*  gouging is the thing. Like right now, with Hurricane [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6983.72s)]
*  Helene, somebody's price gouging [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6985.72s)]
*  somewhere. And that's what it was all [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6987.72s)]
*  about. Where there's a crisis, you know, [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6989.72s)]
*  you want to stop price gouging. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6991.72s)]
*  And 37 states have laws against price [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6993.72s)]
*  gouging. So she's just saying we'll make it national. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6995.72s)]
*  But it's not really a counter to that. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6997.72s)]
*  The real counter, and she, you know, [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=6999.72s)]
*  and I think they'll end up talking about this, the real [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7001.72s)]
*  counter is we're going to help increase wages. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7003.72s)]
*  And the reality is, they [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7005.72s)]
*  call it real wages when [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7007.72s)]
*  the amount of money that you're [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7009.72s)]
*  earning is higher than the amount of inflation. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7011.72s)]
*  The real wages are, you know, [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7013.72s)]
*  significantly up over the last [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7015.72s)]
*  year. Because inflation has gone down, [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7017.72s)]
*  but people have kept on getting their increases. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7019.72s)]
*  So they're catching up on that inflation [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7021.72s)]
*  already. So that's [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7023.72s)]
*  been critically important. And then, [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7025.72s)]
*  you know, you increase the minimum wage, [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7027.72s)]
*  you increase, the other way is to increase productivity. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7029.72s)]
*  So, you know, she's talked about using [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7031.72s)]
*  AI to improve the [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7033.72s)]
*  military, invest in AI as a country. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7035.72s)]
*  That's how you improve productivity. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7037.72s)]
*  And actually, productivity has started to go up. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7039.72s)]
*  And if you look like in manufacturing, [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7041.72s)]
*  there's twice as, all this shit that I've been [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7043.72s)]
*  just geeking out on, right? I [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7045.72s)]
*  guarantee you, once the election is over, I'm not remembering this shit. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7047.72s)]
*  But like, there are [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7049.72s)]
*  five hundred, five thousand unfilled [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7051.72s)]
*  manufacturing jobs. And so [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7053.72s)]
*  when you talk about how do you improve productivity, [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7055.72s)]
*  you know, you've got to first have [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7057.72s)]
*  the people. And when you, there's demand [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7059.72s)]
*  for people, that also pushes [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7061.72s)]
*  up wages. Because when there's more jobs [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7063.72s)]
*  than there are people, you've got to pay more to get them. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7065.72s)]
*  So we're on the right track. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7067.72s)]
*  The bigger problem, honestly, [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7069.72s)]
*  talk politics, Joe Biden [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7071.72s)]
*  can't sell shit. He's the worst salesman. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7073.72s)]
*  I was just going to say that. I'm like, if things have gotten [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7075.72s)]
*  better during this administration, why does [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7077.72s)]
*  everybody still say, ugh, the economy [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7079.72s)]
*  sold that? It's interesting how you've been [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7081.72s)]
*  positioned online. And I think I felt guilty to it. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7083.72s)]
*  Like, you come out here, you're kind of like, [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7085.72s)]
*  you're saying, come on, Kalma wants to do some good stuff. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7087.72s)]
*  But you're also saying that she's not good at communicating [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7089.72s)]
*  this. Obviously, you're [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7091.72s)]
*  shitting on Trump. You're saying, Elon [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7093.72s)]
*  is the greatest entrepreneur ever. But you know, [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7095.72s)]
*  like, I think you're actually quite fair. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7097.72s)]
*  I'm glad that you're sitting here [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7099.72s)]
*  because I think the positioning of you, [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7101.72s)]
*  and I'm sure that [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7103.72s)]
*  there's, you know, money maybe behind this. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7105.72s)]
*  But the positioning of you is, [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7107.72s)]
*  I'm sure there's political [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7109.72s)]
*  benefit in positioning [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7111.72s)]
*  you as a radioactive operative [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7113.72s)]
*  of the left. Oh, by somebody else. They'll at me. Yeah, yeah. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7115.72s)]
*  No, no. I think it basically, [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7117.72s)]
*  No, to your detriment. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7119.72s)]
*  Like the right wing, you know. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7121.72s)]
*  You're just getting hated online. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7123.72s)]
*  I guess what I'm saying is, like, if you have [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7125.72s)]
*  legitimate criticisms of the opposition, [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7127.72s)]
*  they have to make you radioactive. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7129.72s)]
*  Because if a guy like you is coming out [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7131.72s)]
*  and speaking some good, I think, powerful [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7133.72s)]
*  truth, all of a sudden, they got to go, [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7135.72s)]
*  we got to fucking react to this. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7137.72s)]
*  We can't just go, oh, he hates me. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7139.72s)]
*  That's the easiest way to do it. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7141.72s)]
*  I'm just trying to say, I think it was helpful [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7143.72s)]
*  to hear you out. But I interrupted you. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7145.72s)]
*  What was I talking about? [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7147.72s)]
*  Oh, sales. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7149.72s)]
*  Biden. So, oh, my God, it drove me crazy. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7151.72s)]
*  So, like, put aside him, like, [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7153.72s)]
*  kind of losing it. By the way, having talked to him [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7155.72s)]
*  multiple times, I think it really just accelerated [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7157.72s)]
*  over that period of time. He wasn't like, [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7159.72s)]
*  put that aside. That's already in the past. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7161.72s)]
*  But, like, you know how they say [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7163.72s)]
*  sell the sizzle, not the steak? [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7165.72s)]
*  I've never heard that term. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7167.72s)]
*  You never have? That's great. Yeah, you sell the sizzle. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7169.72s)]
*  You don't sell the fucking Biden sells the steak. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7171.72s)]
*  He's going to tell you where the cow was born, [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7173.72s)]
*  what the fucking cow's name was, you know, [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7175.72s)]
*  you know, how many, you know, whatever. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7177.72s)]
*  And he's going to talk about everything but the sizzle. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7179.72s)]
*  He just couldn't sell. And they were pissed [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7181.72s)]
*  because I've said that one time before. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7183.72s)]
*  And they were pissed at me, [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7185.72s)]
*  just somebody I knew. But that's [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7187.72s)]
*  the truth. He can't sell shit. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7189.72s)]
*  And if they could sell, then we'd be [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7191.72s)]
*  having completely different conversations. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7193.72s)]
*  Now, Kamala has been doing this 50 days [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7195.72s)]
*  now, you know, when she stepped in. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7197.72s)]
*  There's a process where she's got to [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7199.72s)]
*  learn to do it. You know, it's just, you know, [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7201.72s)]
*  when you went to working for yourself, doing a podcast [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7203.72s)]
*  is different than a comedy talk. Absolutely. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7205.72s)]
*  You have different things you have to learn. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7207.72s)]
*  Yeah, it was just peculiar to see. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7209.72s)]
*  Yep, that's for you. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7211.72s)]
*  It's just peculiar to see this [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7213.72s)]
*  immense support for her out of [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7215.72s)]
*  nowhere, like when she hadn't even said anything. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7217.72s)]
*  I think a lot of people are like, finally, [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7219.72s)]
*  she's here. She's our hero. And I think the [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7221.72s)]
*  knee-jerk reaction to anybody [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7223.72s)]
*  who at least tries to be like, I'm biased when it comes [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7225.72s)]
*  to the election is, why the fuck [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7227.72s)]
*  are you excited? She doesn't even say anything. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7229.72s)]
*  She isn't Biden. And I [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7231.72s)]
*  think there was some relief with that. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7233.72s)]
*  100%. Yeah. And I think if I viewed [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7235.72s)]
*  it as relief and not [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7237.72s)]
*  she's the one true [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7239.72s)]
*  savior for us all, I think [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7241.72s)]
*  I could have accepted it way more. Yeah. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7243.72s)]
*  I was bothered that there was no platforms [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7245.72s)]
*  on her website for what, a month, two months, whatever. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7247.72s)]
*  No, like, beliefs, nothing on it. Just [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7249.72s)]
*  paid to donate by merch. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7251.72s)]
*  So two things there. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7253.72s)]
*  So one, she did come out [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7255.72s)]
*  and she was the anti-Trump, [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7257.72s)]
*  not in terms of what she said about him, but [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7259.72s)]
*  just as opposed to I hate [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7261.72s)]
*  Taylor Swift. Joy, right? [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7263.72s)]
*  Yeah. You know, positivity, [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7265.72s)]
*  which I think is important. Yeah. If you're going to try [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7267.72s)]
*  to bring people together, that's [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7269.72s)]
*  what you have to do, you know? [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7271.72s)]
*  And I forgot the second [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7273.72s)]
*  part I was going to say. But [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7275.72s)]
*  DNC, maybe the speed. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7277.72s)]
*  Oh, no, no, no, no. Okay. You're [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7279.72s)]
*  right. You're right. So the second part [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7281.72s)]
*  of that is if you [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7283.72s)]
*  all of a sudden just take over a company. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7285.72s)]
*  Well, first of all, let me take one step back. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7287.72s)]
*  Everybody who's ever worked for [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7289.72s)]
*  a company thinks they're smarter than the boss [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7291.72s)]
*  and would do it differently than the boss. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7293.72s)]
*  So when people say, well, why isn't she the same [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7295.72s)]
*  as Biden? Like everybody [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7297.72s)]
*  else, you know, you're going to do things different [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7299.72s)]
*  than your boss if you take over. But [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7301.72s)]
*  like now you take over [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7303.72s)]
*  and you can't just have everything [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7305.72s)]
*  in place. It wasn't like she was planning on running [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7307.72s)]
*  for president. All of a sudden, it was just [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7309.72s)]
*  like, damn, you're the one. You've got [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7311.72s)]
*  to go out there. And she [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7313.72s)]
*  fell back on what she does best. She gives [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7315.72s)]
*  the speeches. She gets everybody happy. She gets [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7317.72s)]
*  everybody fired up. And then she starts putting the pieces [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7319.72s)]
*  together, which makes sense. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7321.72s)]
*  It's interesting about like taking over a company or even [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7323.72s)]
*  like getting a new player on your team. Like I'm an [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7325.72s)]
*  ex-fan my whole life, right? Any new [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7327.72s)]
*  guy we get, the whole city [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7329.72s)]
*  is, nah, he's the truth. He's [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7331.72s)]
*  actually underrated. He's going to take us [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7333.72s)]
*  to a champion. For sure. Everybody's about their team. And here comes [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7335.72s)]
*  Kat, right? Exactly. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7337.72s)]
*  Shout out, Kat. We love you. You're the greatest. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7339.72s)]
*  I think that was a good move, by the way. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7341.72s)]
*  Great move. Yeah. Great [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7343.72s)]
*  move. But there's a [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7345.72s)]
*  but there is that excitement [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7347.72s)]
*  when you've already committed to the team. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7349.72s)]
*  I guess because I haven't committed to a team. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7351.72s)]
*  I don't consider myself either one. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7353.72s)]
*  So there's no reason for me to be excited. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7355.72s)]
*  But if you are someone who's like [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7357.72s)]
*  I identify as a Democrat, I'm a voting Democrat, [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7359.72s)]
*  everything. That's a huge plus. She's Kat. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7361.72s)]
*  She's Kat. She's Kat. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7363.72s)]
*  We had this person [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7365.72s)]
*  we had this person that was [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7367.72s)]
*  not inspiring at all. And all of a sudden [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7369.72s)]
*  there's new leadership. Bam. Our team [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7371.72s)]
*  is going to be successful again. Right. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7373.72s)]
*  And now she's starting to talk and they're like [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7375.72s)]
*  it's going to be great. I'm going to come in [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7377.72s)]
*  and we're going to do things right. We're going to figure it out. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7379.72s)]
*  I'm going to learn the playbook. Yeah. And so [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7381.72s)]
*  she's the new coach coming in. Yeah. It was like low [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7383.72s)]
*  expectations. And she over delivered. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7385.72s)]
*  She did great in that first debate. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7387.72s)]
*  And now all of a sudden people are like wait a minute. I was [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7389.72s)]
*  excited and now I'm not let down. Oh, [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7391.72s)]
*  wow. This could work out. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7393.72s)]
*  And look, she's still got more things to do. Before Biden [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7395.72s)]
*  had that bad debate, like she did not know [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7397.72s)]
*  she was running. So I think if she would have just like [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7399.72s)]
*  jumped out there with policy and doing a whole [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7401.72s)]
*  bunch of interviews, she would have had way more missteps [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7403.72s)]
*  than if she would probably would have taken it [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7405.72s)]
*  from Biden. And the one thing she should [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7407.72s)]
*  not have been and isn't [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7409.72s)]
*  is fucking Biden. But she has a tough [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7411.72s)]
*  time going. I disagree with him on that. Well, because [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7413.72s)]
*  it's your boss. Yeah. And he's still [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7415.72s)]
*  in office. Oh, that [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7417.72s)]
*  is another thing. She can't say, yeah, he's [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7419.72s)]
*  fucking up because you're there co-signing it. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7421.72s)]
*  So you've got to co-sign the boss [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7423.72s)]
*  even though you're about to come in and kind of flip it. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7425.72s)]
*  So that is a delicate balance. She's [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7427.72s)]
*  fucking changing everything on the border. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7429.72s)]
*  Oh, really? What does she say? Yeah, what does she say? [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7431.72s)]
*  Yeah, you're right there. You're letting him in. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7433.72s)]
*  Yeah, I'm letting him in. Someone's got to build [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7435.72s)]
*  the stadium. Right? [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7437.72s)]
*  Okay, okay, okay. He's like [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7441.72s)]
*  any of the other [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7443.72s)]
*  guys. You know, our Lucas Brothers [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7445.72s)]
*  international. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7447.72s)]
*  I know them over seven feet. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7449.72s)]
*  Can you play? [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7451.72s)]
*  Where are you from? Can you play? [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7453.72s)]
*  Oh my lord. Now why is she being harder [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7455.72s)]
*  on the border? Yeah, because like [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7457.72s)]
*  Biden fucked up there again. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7459.72s)]
*  He went, and I think a lot of this had to do [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7461.72s)]
*  with Bernie and Elizabeth Warren, where [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7463.72s)]
*  they were kind of like the trifecta together. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7465.72s)]
*  And they fucked up opening [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7467.72s)]
*  up the borders. They were just too open. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7469.72s)]
*  And I actually, [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7471.72s)]
*  here's my take on Elon Musk on this. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7473.72s)]
*  I think Elon Musk comes across [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7475.72s)]
*  online as an immigration troll. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7477.72s)]
*  But I think what he really [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7479.72s)]
*  thinks, I'm guessing, is that [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7481.72s)]
*  because he's an immigrant, he thinks [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7483.72s)]
*  when just people are flooding across the border [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7485.72s)]
*  and people hate those people, [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7487.72s)]
*  it brings on hate to all immigrants. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7489.72s)]
*  And I think that [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7491.72s)]
*  really is what is underneath [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7493.72s)]
*  his hate for them, that he doesn't really [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7495.72s)]
*  hate them. But it's like, [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7497.72s)]
*  you're bringing on hate. All this shit [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7499.72s)]
*  is bringing on hate for me and my family [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7501.72s)]
*  and who I am. So there are people who [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7503.72s)]
*  worked hard to legally [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7505.72s)]
*  immigrate here, and they're getting a lot of this hate. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7507.72s)]
*  It may look bad. Yeah. And I think that's [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7509.72s)]
*  part of why, you know, some [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7511.72s)]
*  Latinos and [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7513.72s)]
*  other [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7515.72s)]
*  foreign nationalities that are here [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7517.72s)]
*  legally are looking back. Oh, they're supportive [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7519.72s)]
*  of it because they're like, I'm getting all this backlash. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7521.72s)]
*  Backlash, right. And I think that's [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7523.72s)]
*  kind of Elon's way. And I think Kamala recognized [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7525.72s)]
*  that. I really, really do. Now, I haven't had [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7527.72s)]
*  this conversation with her or her team on it. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7529.72s)]
*  But I think Biden was [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7531.72s)]
*  late to the party to figure it out. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7533.72s)]
*  And so he [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7535.72s)]
*  opened the gates too much. And [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7537.72s)]
*  she had to play along because that's [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7539.72s)]
*  the boss. Why would they open the [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7541.72s)]
*  gates? And I understand there are some certain... They didn't [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7543.72s)]
*  open them, right? But they, you know... [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7545.72s)]
*  They were looking the other way. Yeah. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7547.72s)]
*  Just didn't do as good a job as they could. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7549.72s)]
*  And I really...nobody [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7551.72s)]
*  thinks they did a great job. But you hear all these conspiracies [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7553.72s)]
*  about...and this could [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7555.72s)]
*  be like absolute nonsense. But you hear these conspiracies [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7557.72s)]
*  like, oh, they want to let in all these people so they can [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7559.72s)]
*  eventually vote. I've looked it up. They cannot vote. They cannot vote. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7561.72s)]
*  That's Elon's trolling. So that [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7563.72s)]
*  is obviously trolling. That's just trolling. Yeah. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7565.72s)]
*  Is it that, like, one day [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7567.72s)]
*  their children will have more empathy [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7569.72s)]
*  with the party that allowed them to be here [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7571.72s)]
*  and maybe they would have voted in that direction? Well, I mean, it didn't work [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7573.72s)]
*  for Obama if all these people now are not [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7575.72s)]
*  voting for her. Right. You know? [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7577.72s)]
*  It's just... So what [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7579.72s)]
*  would be the justification for it? [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7581.72s)]
*  Is it... Just...so think about why somebody [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7583.72s)]
*  leaves their country. Yeah. They don't leave [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7585.72s)]
*  because every day is a holiday. Yeah. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7587.72s)]
*  In fucking paradise. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They leave [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7589.72s)]
*  because something's fucked up for some reason. Yeah. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7591.72s)]
*  And I don't care who you are. There's got to be [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7593.72s)]
*  a part in your heart that says if, [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7595.72s)]
*  you know, you're in Haiti and there are [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7597.72s)]
*  gang wars and people you know are getting [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7599.72s)]
*  macheted to fucking death, [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7601.72s)]
*  I'm okay if you figure out how to get [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7603.72s)]
*  over here. Yeah. And so I think [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7605.72s)]
*  that was the sentiment, but [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7607.72s)]
*  then it went too far. There's a point of diminishing [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7609.72s)]
*  returns where you have to say, [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7611.72s)]
*  yes, you know, I feel for them [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7613.72s)]
*  and I want to help them, but this [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7615.72s)]
*  is not the right approach to do that. And there may have also [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7617.72s)]
*  been some people taking advantage of that [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7619.72s)]
*  empathy. People who are not in dire situations. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7621.72s)]
*  Right, right. Who you don't need to sign them. Who are like, hey, I'm going to catch [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7623.72s)]
*  a lick right here. Yeah, yeah, for sure. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7625.72s)]
*  It's easier to get a job in America than it would be here. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7627.72s)]
*  Or whatever it is. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7629.72s)]
*  Yeah, of course. People are going to [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7631.72s)]
*  game the system one way or the other. Yes. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7633.72s)]
*  Always going to happen no matter what. So then this is a perfect [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7635.72s)]
*  example of what we were talking about earlier where like the [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7637.72s)]
*  bureaucracy just gets kind of [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7639.72s)]
*  what was it? It's like runaway bureaucracy [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7641.72s)]
*  where you don't want to [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7643.72s)]
*  be the center that comes out and closes it [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7645.72s)]
*  because you're where your constituents would be upset. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7647.72s)]
*  So you don't say anything. It just continues to grow. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7649.72s)]
*  And now you have a problem. All these people are hurt. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7651.72s)]
*  Nobody's speaking for them. It just blew up and now [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7653.72s)]
*  it's blowing up in your face. OK, so we can all at least recognize [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7655.72s)]
*  that there is an issue at a border because some [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7657.72s)]
*  people act like there isn't. I think [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7659.72s)]
*  Kamala a little bit has been like, what are you talking about? [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7661.72s)]
*  We've deported the most people. Well, yeah. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7663.72s)]
*  She's like doing protection for Biden. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7665.72s)]
*  You almost want her to be like, we needed to be [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7667.72s)]
*  stronger. Well, see what's pay [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7669.72s)]
*  attention to what she's doing. And so [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7671.72s)]
*  she says she passed that she'd signed [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7673.72s)]
*  that bipartisan bill that Trump [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7675.72s)]
*  said don't do it. That would add fifteen [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7677.72s)]
*  hundred border patrol agents and add [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7679.72s)]
*  all these other features. And [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7681.72s)]
*  Biden actually did this executive order [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7683.72s)]
*  that said, we're going to [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7685.72s)]
*  basically we're going to get the number [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7687.72s)]
*  of people crossing the border [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7689.72s)]
*  down to fifteen hundred and said [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7691.72s)]
*  that just because you step foot on American [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7693.72s)]
*  soil, which used to be the rule, doesn't give [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7695.72s)]
*  you the right to apply for asylum, [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7697.72s)]
*  which is 180 degrees from where [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7699.72s)]
*  it used to be. And to [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7701.72s)]
*  me, that's making a successful [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7703.72s)]
*  move. That's doing the right thing. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7705.72s)]
*  And now when you look at the actual [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7707.72s)]
*  numbers and you guys can actually look up the [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7709.72s)]
*  numbers, the number of [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7711.72s)]
*  border encounters is [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7713.72s)]
*  what they call it now [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7715.72s)]
*  is the same as when Trump left office [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7717.72s)]
*  pre pandemic. So it's [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7719.72s)]
*  not like what he was doing had [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7721.72s)]
*  had better impact. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7723.72s)]
*  But the question and here's the zillion dollar [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7725.72s)]
*  question. What do you do with the [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7727.72s)]
*  people who are already in here? Right. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7729.72s)]
*  So you saw some of these numbers that Fox [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7731.72s)]
*  News put out that came from, you know, [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7733.72s)]
*  thirteen thousand murderers and [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7735.72s)]
*  sixteen thousand rapists. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7737.72s)]
*  True factual information. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7739.72s)]
*  What they didn't say, though, was they didn't [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7741.72s)]
*  just come across the last couple of years. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7743.72s)]
*  Those some of those people that are in [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7745.72s)]
*  the country are in prison [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7747.72s)]
*  are under indictment [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7749.72s)]
*  or have been have been [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7751.72s)]
*  here ten to five, [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7753.72s)]
*  ten, fifteen, twenty, thirty, forty years. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7755.72s)]
*  They're trying to make it sound like this all happened [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7757.72s)]
*  under Biden. It didn't. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7759.72s)]
*  It didn't. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7761.72s)]
*  You know, that's part of the bullshit [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7763.72s)]
*  that comes from, like you said, you know, [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7765.72s)]
*  if somebody disagrees with you, they're going to find [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7767.72s)]
*  something to throw at you. It's easier to make you radioactive [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7769.72s)]
*  than to have like a discussion [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7771.72s)]
*  of other ideas. They are great. Both sides [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7773.72s)]
*  are great at that. The Democrats just call [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7775.72s)]
*  you racist or sexist or whatever [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7777.72s)]
*  it is. And then the Republicans call you a cuck. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7779.72s)]
*  You're a pussy. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7781.72s)]
*  One comes from the candidate, right? [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7783.72s)]
*  And that's the difference. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7785.72s)]
*  But now we are where we are. So the [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7787.72s)]
*  question is whether is eleven [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7789.72s)]
*  million, thirteen million, Trump says twenty [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7791.72s)]
*  one million people who are not American [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7793.72s)]
*  citizens and aren't supposed to be here. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7795.72s)]
*  What do you do? Trump says you just [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7797.72s)]
*  deport him. But he doesn't say [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7799.72s)]
*  how. And how he does [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7801.72s)]
*  it is everything. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7803.72s)]
*  Because, you know, can you imagine [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7805.72s)]
*  is so [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7807.72s)]
*  and so here. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7811.72s)]
*  Ah, hide. Walk in. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7813.72s)]
*  Remember that probably before [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7815.72s)]
*  your time, there was a little kid. Elion Gonzalez. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7817.72s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7819.72s)]
*  Yeah. Guns in his face was one. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7821.72s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. Elion [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7823.72s)]
*  Gonzalez. Do you want [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7825.72s)]
*  every Hispanic neighborhood, every [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7827.72s)]
*  Haitian neighborhood to have ten [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7829.72s)]
*  Elion Gonzalez's? Yeah. He went back, [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7831.72s)]
*  right? Yeah, he ended up going back. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7833.72s)]
*  Because he couldn't throw. I think they tested his arm. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7835.72s)]
*  He said he was twelve and he was twenty [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7837.72s)]
*  two. Well, like the kid is throwing [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7839.72s)]
*  seventy four at twelve years old with [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7841.72s)]
*  location. We're like, we got to keep him. We find out he's [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7843.72s)]
*  thirty two year old Dominican. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7845.72s)]
*  He's not even from Cuba. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7847.72s)]
*  He's Dominican. He's great. Doesn't matter. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7849.72s)]
*  They find you on a boat off [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7851.72s)]
*  the coast of Florida. Just say I am Cuban. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7853.72s)]
*  Right. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7855.72s)]
*  Mark's my uncle. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7857.72s)]
*  But think about it. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7859.72s)]
*  OK, Elion Gonzalez. That's a bad look to be [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7861.72s)]
*  knocking on every door and sending him back. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7863.72s)]
*  So they're basically looking at is there a [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7865.72s)]
*  tasteful way to do it or do you find a way [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7867.72s)]
*  to not repatriate, [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7869.72s)]
*  but do you find a way to give these people some [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7871.72s)]
*  form of citizenship? What Harris is saying [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7873.72s)]
*  is if they're a criminal, you gone. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7875.72s)]
*  You gone. Yeah. You gone. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7877.72s)]
*  All these you out. Yeah. If [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7879.72s)]
*  you're not a criminal, [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7881.72s)]
*  that asylum process. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7883.72s)]
*  You have to go through the paperwork [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7885.72s)]
*  and fill out and we're going to track you [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7887.72s)]
*  on it to make sure it works. Now, she gets a little [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7889.72s)]
*  vague from there, at least as far as what I know. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7891.72s)]
*  And so, but Trump on the [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7893.72s)]
*  other hand, just says you [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7895.72s)]
*  gone. And I think, I think [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7897.72s)]
*  that taps into the emotional [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7899.72s)]
*  reaction a lot of people have. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7901.72s)]
*  Maybe they don't have a job. They've seen their job [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7903.72s)]
*  get passed on to someone who's not, you know, [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7905.72s)]
*  legally here. They have a lot of issues with it. So [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7907.72s)]
*  they're like, you know what? Fuck you. Don't argue. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7909.72s)]
*  I'm not arguing with the sentiment. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7911.72s)]
*  Not at all. But you [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7913.72s)]
*  have to think through. If you're an informed [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7915.72s)]
*  voter, you have to think through. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7917.72s)]
*  What if he, Elion Gonzalez is [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7919.72s)]
*  everybody. If that's your [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7921.72s)]
*  family, what the fuck are you doing? What's [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7923.72s)]
*  Trump's approach? How is it [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7925.72s)]
*  different from Obama's approach? [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7927.72s)]
*  Obama was the deporter in chief. Yeah. He was. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7929.72s)]
*  And I remember hearing some of those stories. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7931.72s)]
*  He didn't just yank them out, but he sent [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7933.72s)]
*  you the paperwork first. You know, and [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7935.72s)]
*  there was a process. Obama didn't even let his [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7937.72s)]
*  dad come. You don't want him to [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7939.72s)]
*  send his dad back. Go back to Kenya, bro. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7941.72s)]
*  You can't hoop. Go. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7943.72s)]
*  But no, that [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7945.72s)]
*  is, yeah, I don't think that we should [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7947.72s)]
*  necessarily like [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7949.72s)]
*  ascribe the term like racist or xenophobic [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7951.72s)]
*  to people who want there to be a strong [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7953.72s)]
*  border. I think we got to get away from that. A hundred [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7955.72s)]
*  percent. So there are Democrats that do that, particularly [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7957.72s)]
*  online. Right. They're going to call you names online [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7959.72s)]
*  just like they call me names, you names, all that shit. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7961.72s)]
*  But from the presidential [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7963.72s)]
*  candidate, you're only [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7965.72s)]
*  hearing that shit from one side. Yeah. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7967.72s)]
*  You're not hearing it from both sides. You don't hear [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7969.72s)]
*  her talking shit about anything, about [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7971.72s)]
*  anybody not named JD or Donald. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7973.72s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. But I do [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7975.72s)]
*  think it is up to her [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7977.72s)]
*  to not let those extreme [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7979.72s)]
*  constituents sway [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7981.72s)]
*  her messaging. Because [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7983.72s)]
*  agree. Agree. Most Americans [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7985.72s)]
*  want, I think, a strong border. A hundred percent. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7987.72s)]
*  And I think don't. It's kind of [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7989.72s)]
*  peculiar. You're like, well, why wouldn't you want a strong [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7991.72s)]
*  border? You know, again, if [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7993.72s)]
*  if you think that [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7995.72s)]
*  you're fucking going to get machete'd if you don't [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7997.72s)]
*  come. But we're all immigrant kids [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=7999.72s)]
*  here. We believe in immigration. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8001.72s)]
*  We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for immigration. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8003.72s)]
*  But you're allowed to have [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8005.72s)]
*  there's rules. Only white people do. Yeah. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8007.72s)]
*  Only white people [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8009.72s)]
*  jobs, right? [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8011.72s)]
*  No, no, no. I think that's good. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8013.72s)]
*  Okay. Okay. Okay. Listen, I know that you're a busy [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8015.72s)]
*  guy and we don't have tons of time. No, I'm loving this shit, man. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8017.72s)]
*  We just have a lot of questions for you. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8019.72s)]
*  I'm loving it. I can't wait to go. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8021.72s)]
*  How do you feel about the climate of this election? [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8023.72s)]
*  Trump, two assassination [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8025.72s)]
*  attempts. Do you feel it's the fault of [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8027.72s)]
*  them? That's fucked up, right? No, it's not nobody's [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8029.72s)]
*  fault. Like I said, there's 330 [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8031.72s)]
*  million people in this country. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8033.72s)]
*  You're not going to be shocked if it's two [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8035.72s)]
*  idiots that do something. Now, [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8037.72s)]
*  it would have been crazy if it was Haitian dude that did [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8039.72s)]
*  something. You know, then you can [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8041.72s)]
*  like maybe point a direct line. But [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8043.72s)]
*  how can you account for that [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8045.72s)]
*  dude that the second one who fortunately didn't get a shot off? [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8047.72s)]
*  Like, he was [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8049.72s)]
*  insane. But it's still different. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8051.72s)]
*  It's not like this is happening every time. No, it's [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8053.72s)]
*  not. Did you read that story about someone [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8055.72s)]
*  walked up to Obama's car and had a gun? [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8057.72s)]
*  Oh, I did hear that. I think that there's [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8059.72s)]
*  assassination attempts on every president. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8061.72s)]
*  We just haven't seen them this [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8063.72s)]
*  close since. Or the one [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8065.72s)]
*  to Trump. I mean, Ronald [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8067.72s)]
*  Reagan, Gerald Ford got shot at [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8069.72s)]
*  and then they missed. I think a quarter of all [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8071.72s)]
*  presidents, there's an assassination. That's what he said. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8073.72s)]
*  Trump said that. They're like gas station attendants. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8075.72s)]
*  Like, he's a dangerous fucking [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8077.72s)]
*  gentleman. It's like GTA. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8079.72s)]
*  Did you think about that shit? Like when you're considering running, [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8081.72s)]
*  you gotta go, there's a 25% chance [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8083.72s)]
*  I take a bullet. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8085.72s)]
*  That doesn't make me happy, no. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8087.72s)]
*  Yes! Like, I get the vote in your [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8089.72s)]
*  family. Yeah, it's [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8091.72s)]
*  an insane endeavor. Are you going to [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8093.72s)]
*  ask your family every four years [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8095.72s)]
*  to see if they change their vote? No, I'm done with that. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8097.72s)]
*  I'm done with that idea. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8099.72s)]
*  I mean, yeah. But it does seem like [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8101.72s)]
*  you can make a lot of change without having to. Like, if you can change [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8103.72s)]
*  the way health insurance is [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8105.72s)]
*  done, that's no president has been able to do that. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8107.72s)]
*  Exactly right. That's been part of the [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8109.72s)]
*  conversation with myself. And you know, [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8111.72s)]
*  that's my ego, right? That's my arrogance. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8113.72s)]
*  It's just like, fuck. Like, when I'm [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8115.72s)]
*  said and done and I'm six [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8117.72s)]
*  feet under, that they put, he fucked [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8119.72s)]
*  up, healthcare. Fuck. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8121.72s)]
*  People are like, done. Yeah. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8123.72s)]

*  You're done with sports teams? Yeah, no more sports. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8217.72s)]
*  I mean, if my [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8219.72s)]
*  kids get older and decide that that's [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8221.72s)]
*  really something they want to do. Do it together. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8223.72s)]
*  Yeah, then I can see doing it together. What about [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8225.72s)]
*  there's a thing with... [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8227.72s)]
*  I feel like buying a team. I have a [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8229.72s)]
*  question about this. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8231.72s)]
*  It's fine. There's a thing with [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8233.72s)]
*  buying a sports team, right, where you get to depreciate [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8235.72s)]
*  the value of the... [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8237.72s)]
*  I don't know if it's still the case. When I first bought it, [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8239.72s)]
*  can you break down that tax loophole? So it was, you get [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8241.72s)]
*  to depreciate the value of your player contracts. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8243.72s)]
*  I thought it was the value of the entire team. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8245.72s)]
*  No, I think it was just a player. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8247.72s)]
*  I don't remember. It's been 20 some years. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8249.72s)]
*  But I think it was just the player contracts [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8251.72s)]
*  that you could have. You can look that up. I don't [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8253.72s)]
*  remember. But now it's just [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8255.72s)]
*  so fucking expensive to buy a team. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8257.72s)]
*  Like, you got to be richer than me [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8259.72s)]
*  to be able to buy an NFL team or [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8261.72s)]
*  even an NBA team by yourself. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8263.72s)]
*  Those days are like [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8265.72s)]
*  long gone. I walked in. It was funny as fuck. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8267.72s)]
*  Like, this is right when we sold [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8269.72s)]
*  broadcast.com and I was just getting paid. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8271.72s)]
*  And I still had Yahoo stock. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8273.72s)]
*  And literally, one day, someone [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8275.72s)]
*  would say, how could you pay $285 million? Which [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8277.72s)]
*  that time was the highest for an NBA. I remember that. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8279.72s)]
*  They were like, you're an idiot. You're fucking... But that very [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8281.72s)]
*  day, the stock price of [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8283.72s)]
*  Yahoo went up like $100, [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8285.72s)]
*  which paid for the whole team, right? It just paid for [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8287.72s)]
*  the whole team. And I was like, [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8289.72s)]
*  it's funny money. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8291.72s)]
*  It's all good. Now you moved to Dallas in like [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8293.72s)]
*  82. Yeah. What [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8295.72s)]
*  brought you to Dallas? And then was that the team you always [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8297.72s)]
*  wanted to buy? No. So first of all, [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8299.72s)]
*  I went to Indiana University [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8301.72s)]
*  and I had a bunch of buddies that were [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8303.72s)]
*  down in Dallas. And they're like, you gotta [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8305.72s)]
*  come down here. You gotta come down here. What was the reasoning? [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8307.72s)]
*  They said it's fun. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8309.72s)]
*  Weather's a whole lot better than Pittsburgh or Indiana. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8311.72s)]
*  And the economy [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8313.72s)]
*  is good. And the women [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8315.72s)]
*  are hot as fuck. I'm like, let's go! [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8317.72s)]
*  So I had a Fiat, 77 [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8319.72s)]
*  Fiat X19, and I [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8321.72s)]
*  had a hole in the floorboard. It was just a [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8323.72s)]
*  junker. And you know, one of them, you had to put oil in. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8325.72s)]
*  And I got there, [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8327.72s)]
*  and there were five guys living in a [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8329.72s)]
*  three-bedroom apartment. And I'm like, let me just [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8331.72s)]
*  stay for a couple days until I find a place to work. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8333.72s)]
*  Stayed there eight [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8335.72s)]
*  months, nine months. Got a job first working as [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8337.72s)]
*  a bartender slash bar back [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8339.72s)]
*  in a place called Alonzo on Greenville Avenue [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8341.72s)]
*  in Dallas. Then got a job working in [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8343.72s)]
*  software, and that was my first real tech job. [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8345.72s)]
*  And that's what kind of set me off. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8347.72s)]
*  And then I got, at nine months in, I got fired. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8349.72s)]
*  And I said, fuck it, I'm [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8351.72s)]
*  a lousy employee and started a company called Micro Solutions. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8353.72s)]
*  And that was my first real business. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8355.72s)]
*  Built that up to like 30 million plus in [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8357.72s)]
*  sales. Sold it for six [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8359.72s)]
*  million bucks. I got two. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8361.72s)]
*  Another guy brought in, got two, [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8363.72s)]
*  and then all the employees, we had eight employees, [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8365.72s)]
*  split a million. And [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8367.72s)]
*  sold that. I was 29, 30. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8369.72s)]
*  Bought a lifetime pass in American Airlines. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8371.72s)]
*  Partied like a mother- [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8373.72s)]
*  Oh, you're one of those? Oh, partied like a motherfucking rock star. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8375.72s)]
*  So wait a minute, you still have the lifetime pass? [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8377.72s)]
*  I gave it to a friend. I gave it to my dad. My dad [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8379.72s)]
*  passed, and then I gave it to a guy [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8381.72s)]
*  that I work with, saves me money on and all that. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8383.72s)]
*  Wait, you can gift the pass? [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8385.72s)]
*  I let you do it one time. One time, yeah. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8387.72s)]
*  They gave me a second time because I stopped using it because I got a plane. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8389.72s)]
*  So they cut me some slack and [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8391.72s)]
*  let me give it to somebody. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8393.72s)]

*  I sold my company, got the check. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8421.72s)]
*  I don't know if you- [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8423.72s)]
*  They have them here, the old time steak houses where they have the plugs for the phones. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8425.72s)]
*  And you can call. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8427.72s)]
*  I'm fucked up, just fucked up out of my mind. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8429.72s)]
*  And my buddies were going- [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8431.72s)]
*  I'm like, barely speaking. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8433.72s)]
*  And I'll bang my head on the cable. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8435.72s)]
*  And my buddies were like, what are you going to get? [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8437.72s)]
*  I'm going to get another car, I'm going to get another house, I got a house. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8439.72s)]
*  You know what I want? [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8441.72s)]
*  I want to see if they have a lifetime pass on American Airlines. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8443.72s)]
*  And you know how when you travel enough, you remember the number? [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8445.72s)]
*  So it's like 1-800-433-6464. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8447.72s)]
*  Bam. Do you guys sell lifetime passes? [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8451.72s)]
*  And they were like, let me put you in touch [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8453.72s)]
*  with the AirPass department. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8455.72s)]
*  I'm like, hello, here we go. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8457.72s)]
*  And so they sent me an application, [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8459.72s)]
*  125 grand for me and anybody else [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8461.72s)]
*  for the rest of my life. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8463.72s)]
*  To be fair, it's 125 grand on the early 90s, so it's more than it is now. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8465.72s)]
*  Okay, so whatever the fuck it was. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8467.72s)]
*  But also American is the hub in Dallas. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8469.72s)]
*  That's their fucking hub. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8471.72s)]
*  American Airlines Arena too? [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8473.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8475.72s)]
*  I figured out it would be 12 cents a mile. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8477.72s)]
*  12 cents a mile. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8479.72s)]
*  And so I moved to LA, [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8481.72s)]
*  because I broke up with my girlfriend, moved to LA, [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8483.72s)]
*  and I was living in Manhattan Beach, and no lie, [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8485.72s)]
*  like I'd go out to a club. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8487.72s)]
*  You been to Vegas? [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8489.72s)]
*  Let's go to Vegas. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8491.72s)]
*  Let's go to Vegas. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8493.72s)]
*  What a dream. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8495.72s)]
*  Let's go to Madrid. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8497.72s)]
*  Okay, let's go to Madrid. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8499.72s)]
*  First class. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8501.72s)]
*  You want to go to Moscow? Okay, let's go to Moscow. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8503.72s)]
*  It was insane. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8505.72s)]
*  You don't have to pay the taxes, nothing. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8507.72s)]
*  If I did, the statute of limitations is long gone. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8509.72s)]
*  Did American Airlines not think they were going to be around for a while? [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8511.72s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8513.72s)]
*  Was it like a million dollars today? [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8515.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's probably like a million dollars today. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8517.72s)]
*  Okay, that's a lot of fucking money. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8519.72s)]
*  But they stopped them because there were some dudes [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8521.72s)]
*  flying, flying, flying, flying, flying. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8523.72s)]
*  Because I also got my air miles. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8525.72s)]
*  You stopped it. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8527.72s)]
*  They're literally like a guy, [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8529.72s)]
*  I remember reading about it when they [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8531.72s)]
*  talked about, they closed it, and I remember reading why. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8533.72s)]
*  Because like a dude would fly from Dallas to [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8535.72s)]
*  Oklahoma City and back, Dallas to [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8537.72s)]
*  Arkansas and back and back and back and back and back, [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8539.72s)]
*  do the double miles, triple miles, [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8541.72s)]
*  and so he just had like a zillion miles he was [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8543.72s)]
*  given out, and that was costing him a fortune. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8545.72s)]
*  He would fly and then give his miles [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8547.72s)]
*  to homies. What a guy, dude. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8549.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8551.72s)]
*  Yo, do you know the guy [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8553.72s)]
*  Andy Beal? Yeah. The banker? [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8555.72s)]
*  Yeah. Okay, there's a book [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8557.72s)]
*  that I read randomly about. About poker? [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8559.72s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I didn't read the book, but I know the [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8561.72s)]
*  story. Okay, and he's actually [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8563.72s)]
*  a good dude. I like him. His kids are really cool. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8565.72s)]
*  So there's this banker [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8567.72s)]
*  in Dallas, if I'm not mistaken, [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8569.72s)]
*  and he got into poker, and [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8571.72s)]
*  he really got obsessed with it. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8573.72s)]
*  And he thought that he could take [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8575.72s)]
*  on the best poker players in the world if he [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8577.72s)]
*  raised the stakes enough to make them uncomfortable. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8579.72s)]
*  Right. So the idea was if they're just playing [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8581.72s)]
*  for like lower stakes, he's going to get washed. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8583.72s)]
*  But once you get those [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8585.72s)]
*  professional guys thinking about a million dollars [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8587.72s)]
*  in hand, they'll start freaking out, and [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8589.72s)]
*  they'll freeze up, and he can handle the losses. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8591.72s)]
*  Yeah, because he's really good at math. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8593.72s)]
*  Math genius. Math genius. But there's another thing [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8595.72s)]
*  that impressed me about him. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8597.72s)]
*  He tried to basically start [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8599.72s)]
*  SpaceX before SpaceX. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8601.72s)]
*  It wasn't SpaceX, but [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8603.72s)]
*  it was a private satellite [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8605.72s)]
*  positioning company. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8607.72s)]
*  That I didn't really know much about. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8609.72s)]
*  So he was sending rockets into the sky, and the idea [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8611.72s)]
*  was he could do it for cheaper [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8613.72s)]
*  than NASA. And the US [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8615.72s)]
*  government undercut him. And they [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8617.72s)]
*  started doing it at a loss. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8619.72s)]
*  Just to fuck him up. Just to fuck him up. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8621.72s)]
*  And I understand you want to control information. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8623.72s)]
*  It's still fucked up. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8625.72s)]
*  This is a different time. But it just [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8627.72s)]
*  goes to show, like, no one [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8629.72s)]
*  really talks about this guy. He likes it that way. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8631.72s)]
*  He likes it that way. Yeah, he seems to be private. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8633.72s)]
*  But Elon figured out a way to do it. And now it seems like [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8635.72s)]
*  the government works seamlessly with Elon. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8637.72s)]
*  Yeah, they still fuck with him, but still. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8639.72s)]
*  But it's a better relationship. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8641.72s)]
*  Then he's straight up undercut. He found [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8643.72s)]
*  a way to do it cheaper. He could get the things up in the sky. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8645.72s)]
*  And NASA just came in and was like, [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8647.72s)]
*  well, we'll do it. He's not a fan of the government. That I know. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8649.72s)]
*  He's definitely not. But he's a good [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8651.72s)]
*  dude, man. I like him. He's just [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8653.72s)]
*  loud and just not real [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8655.72s)]
*  social, but social. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8657.72s)]
*  Like somebody you can't just sit and chit chat [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8659.72s)]
*  normally, but he's just loud [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8661.72s)]
*  and fun. Let's go! You know, type of guy. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8663.72s)]
*  I like him. He comes to Mav's games [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8665.72s)]
*  to chill with him. His kids come. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8667.72s)]
*  Good dude. Interesting, like, [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8669.72s)]
*  disposition to go after something like that. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8671.72s)]
*  Like, you interface, and you [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8673.72s)]
*  are one of these people. You interface with a lot of [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8675.72s)]
*  these guys that, I guess, are big dreamers. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8677.72s)]
*  And they can execute these big things. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8679.72s)]
*  Do you find that there's [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8681.72s)]
*  a similar trait that you all have? [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8683.72s)]
*  Oh, good question. Yeah, you know, that is [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8685.72s)]
*  a good question. I think there [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8687.72s)]
*  is. I think, like, Andy's [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8689.72s)]
*  a good example. You just [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8691.72s)]
*  got to be a learner, because you can't [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8693.72s)]
*  just fucking wing it. If you're trying to build something, [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8695.72s)]
*  either you can build it or you can't, [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8697.72s)]
*  and you got to learn the shit required to build it. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8699.72s)]
*  If you're going to run a business, you [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8701.72s)]
*  got to, you had to learn the podcast [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8703.72s)]
*  business. You had to learn the tour business. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8705.72s)]
*  You had to learn the comedy business. And if [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8707.72s)]
*  you didn't, people are going to fuck with you. And if you can't [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8709.72s)]
*  do it, then you're not [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8711.72s)]
*  going to build anything. Yeah, information [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8713.72s)]
*  is the gap, really. A lot of people don't want to put [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8715.72s)]
*  in that intellectual. Don't want to put in the time, and it's just [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8717.72s)]
*  you got to do the work. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8719.72s)]
*  I can't even tell you how many [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8721.72s)]
*  hours a day. Like, some of the numbers, [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8723.72s)]
*  I don't even know how I remember that shit, [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8725.72s)]
*  but why the fuck was I even reading that shit in the first place? [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8727.72s)]
*  Because I just read and [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8729.72s)]
*  learn. Because to me, [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8731.72s)]
*  like, before the internet, I used to walk through [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8733.72s)]
*  bookstores and just, like, [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8735.72s)]
*  sit on the floor and read books I couldn't afford. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8737.72s)]
*  And I would be like, one idea. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8739.72s)]
*  Just give me that one idea [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8741.72s)]
*  that propels me. And [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8743.72s)]
*  one piece here, one piece there, [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8745.72s)]
*  one piece there. So I learned a lot about business. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8747.72s)]
*  And now, like, on Shark Tank, [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8749.72s)]
*  any type of business can walk in, [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8751.72s)]
*  and before the other sharks even figure [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8753.72s)]
*  what the fuck's going on, I know what their business is. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8755.72s)]
*  I know exactly what's going on and how it's going to work. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8757.72s)]
*  Sometimes you tell them. What kind of business [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8759.72s)]
*  you are. Yeah, and you don't even know, right? [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8761.72s)]
*  They don't even know. You got to know what business you're in, [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8763.72s)]
*  but you got to learn. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8765.72s)]
*  Like, what are the skills? You got to [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8767.72s)]
*  be curious, you got to be [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8769.72s)]
*  agile because shit changes, and you got to be [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8771.72s)]
*  able to sell. You got to be able to sell your tour, [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8773.72s)]
*  you got to be able to sell your sponsors, you got to be agile [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8775.72s)]
*  because shit's changing every day, technology's [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8777.72s)]
*  changing, sponsors changing. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8779.72s)]
*  How much do you attribute to [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8781.72s)]
*  your killer instinct [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8783.72s)]
*  as the CEO when you're looking [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8785.72s)]
*  at other people that are running companies? [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8787.72s)]
*  Like, are you comparing them to yourself? [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8789.72s)]
*  No. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8791.72s)]
*  Not really at all. I mean, [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8793.72s)]
*  honestly, like, there's investments [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8795.72s)]
*  I've made where I still haven't met the people. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8797.72s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8799.72s)]
*  Because I do a lot by email, and [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8801.72s)]
*  I'll just barrage you [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8803.72s)]
*  with questions via email, and I [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8805.72s)]
*  can tell by how you answer whether you know your shit or not. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8807.72s)]
*  Oh, so you are assessing their personality? [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8809.72s)]
*  Yeah, but not necessarily their personality, but their knowledge. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8811.72s)]
*  Because if you don't have the knowledge, your personality [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8813.72s)]
*  don't mean shit. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8815.72s)]
*  I just ask that because, like, we had [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8817.72s)]
*  Dana on the podcast, Dana White, [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8819.72s)]
*  and he is [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8821.72s)]
*  so relentless. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8823.72s)]
*  And it was one of those things where [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8825.72s)]
*  obviously I'm nowhere close to the position [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8827.72s)]
*  to hire a Dana, but I would [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8829.72s)]
*  understand why somebody [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8831.72s)]
*  would invest in him. Oh, for sure. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8833.72s)]
*  He's a beast. He's a motherfucking beast. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8835.72s)]
*  And I respect the shit out of him. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8837.72s)]
*  We disagree in some shit. We almost got into a fight [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8839.72s)]
*  one time in a fucking bar. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8841.72s)]
*  Dana tells the story because I was too fucked up to remember. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8843.72s)]
*  He used to box back in the day, too. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8845.72s)]
*  Yeah, he would've kicked my ass. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8847.72s)]
*  For real. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8849.72s)]
*  I would've got my [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8851.72s)]
*  chops in, but he would've kicked my ass. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8853.72s)]
*  But [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8855.72s)]
*  we were at a club in Vegas, and [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8857.72s)]
*  just started talking shit to each other for whatever [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8859.72s)]
*  reason. Remember, like I told you with Trump, [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8861.72s)]
*  I was doing the MMA stuff? [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8863.72s)]
*  And it kind of competed. And so there were a lot of [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8865.72s)]
*  fighters like Fedor who didn't fight [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8867.72s)]
*  for Dana because [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8869.72s)]
*  he didn't think that he paid enough [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8871.72s)]
*  and this and that. So they were coming to me, [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8873.72s)]
*  and we were starting to put together some fights. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8875.72s)]
*  And for whatever reason, we got into it. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8877.72s)]
*  Again, I don't remember all the details. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8879.72s)]
*  And Dana told me more than I remember. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8881.72s)]
*  I kind of remember it. It was just like, [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8883.72s)]
*  more drunk shit. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8885.72s)]
*  But yeah, he said it almost happened. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8887.72s)]
*  It's funny because we did an interview together [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8889.72s)]
*  where we both got interviewed at the same time. And he was [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8891.72s)]
*  talking about it. And I was like, what? Oh yeah. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8893.72s)]
*  But he's one of those guys [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8895.72s)]
*  who is just going to walk through the wall. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8897.72s)]
*  He's a beast. He's a motherfucking [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8899.72s)]
*  beast. And I imagine when [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8901.72s)]
*  you're, I thought at least, when [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8903.72s)]
*  you're looking at people that are running [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8905.72s)]
*  businesses, and I wonder if that's also how [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8907.72s)]
*  he thinks about it, you have a certain [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8909.72s)]
*  personality, a certain disposition that you're looking for [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8911.72s)]
*  to lead a company. There are certain people you know [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8913.72s)]
*  will just, they're going to let, they're going to let it rip. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8915.72s)]
*  Yeah, but see, that kind of personality, like me or Dana [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8917.72s)]
*  or even Elon, you're not working for somebody [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8919.72s)]
*  else. So that's the other thing. [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8921.72s)]
*  It's like, do you see that in some [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8923.72s)]
*  people and go, this is going to be a [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8925.72s)]
*  problem? [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8927.72s)]
*  Ah! For sure. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8929.72s)]
*  Like, you know. You wouldn't just blindly [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8931.72s)]
*  write them a check though and be like, you, you got it. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8933.72s)]
*  No, I've written [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8935.72s)]
*  checks to people I've never met before. Like millions [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8937.72s)]
*  of dollars to people I've met. And I've done really well on [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8939.72s)]
*  it. But [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8941.72s)]
*  in terms of hiring people, [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8943.72s)]
*  and I really suck at hiring, I just, [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8945.72s)]
*  I admit it, I know it, so I always try to get, [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8947.72s)]
*  like, but if somebody's like [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8949.72s)]
*  that, you're not going to be an employee [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8951.72s)]
*  for long. But what if you make him the head [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8953.72s)]
*  of the company, you give him a piece of the company? [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8955.72s)]
*  Still. He's not, like, it's still my company. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8957.72s)]
*  And if it's what I want, [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8959.72s)]
*  then he, [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8961.72s)]
*  like, he'll be telling me, fuck you. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8963.72s)]
*  So with that type of personality, you need to [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8965.72s)]
*  just invest in them. Like, it's okay to [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8967.72s)]
*  get a job to learn, you know, [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8969.72s)]
*  and get your shit together. Because, you know, you can be 21, [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8971.72s)]
*  22 out of college, and you might have that personality. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8973.72s)]
*  But you don't have the information, you don't have the [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8975.72s)]
*  experience. Exactly, you don't have the knowledge. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8977.72s)]
*  And then sometimes, not having the [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8979.72s)]
*  knowledge is to your benefit, because you don't know [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8981.72s)]
*  what you don't know, and you don't, you're not afraid of anything. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8983.72s)]
*  And, you know, that's [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8985.72s)]
*  the way I was when I first got started, and I was the youngest [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8987.72s)]
*  guy in the room. I was like, oh, you're an [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8989.72s)]
*  idiot. I'm like, okay, right, whatever, [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8991.72s)]
*  right. But you ain't going to stop me. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8993.72s)]
*  And so, [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8995.72s)]
*  you know, if somebody is that [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8997.72s)]
*  type of, has that type of attitude, [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=8999.72s)]
*  they just got to figure it out on their own. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9001.72s)]
*  And it may not even be you [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9003.72s)]
*  want to give them an investment, because they [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9005.72s)]
*  may zigzag, you know, and pivot [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9007.72s)]
*  50 times. Was that you, though? [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9009.72s)]
*  No, I never had to pivot a lot. Was it hard for you to work for people? [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9011.72s)]
*  Oh, yeah, to work for people? Oh, I was the [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9013.72s)]
*  worst. You need to do it your way. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9015.72s)]
*  Yes, I mean, like, I got a job at [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9017.72s)]
*  Mellon Bank right out of college. And [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9019.72s)]
*  Pittsburgh, I assume. Pittsburgh, yeah. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9023.72s)]
*  And so, I wasn't there [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9025.72s)]
*  a long time. And so, I got this job, [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9027.72s)]
*  and I'm reading this stuff, [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9029.72s)]
*  and I see this thing. I thought, oh, yeah, the CEO of [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9031.72s)]
*  Mellon Bank, who had tens of thousands [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9033.72s)]
*  of employees, one of the biggest, top [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9035.72s)]
*  20 bank at the time. And I just sent [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9037.72s)]
*  him a note to the CEO [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9039.72s)]
*  saying, hey, this is going to help you. And he sent me a thank you [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9041.72s)]
*  note back. And I'm thinking, okay, [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9043.72s)]
*  you know, I just want to help my company make [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9045.72s)]
*  money. And so, then I did this thing called [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9047.72s)]
*  the Rookie Club, where I got a bunch [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9049.72s)]
*  of people who started right around me, and I went and found [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9051.72s)]
*  some VPs to go out to a bar, have [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9053.72s)]
*  a drink with us, and talk to us about the company. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9055.72s)]
*  My fucking boss went [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9057.72s)]
*  nuts. Just [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9059.72s)]
*  nuts. Why? Because he was like, [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9061.72s)]
*  you didn't do this through me, and you didn't, [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9063.72s)]
*  you know, work it all out. Your direct [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9065.72s)]
*  report boss? Yeah, the guy I reported directly to. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9067.72s)]
*  Not the big boss of the company. No, no, no, no. [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9069.72s)]
*  My direct report, by the way, just went nuts [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9071.72s)]
*  on me. And I literally started to cry. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9073.72s)]
*  I was such a, oh, it was bad. I was like, [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9075.72s)]
*  I mean, I was just so emotional, because [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9077.72s)]
*  I just thought I was doing the same thing. When I say cry, I wasn't [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9079.72s)]
*  sobbing. But I'm like, oh, my [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9081.72s)]
*  contacts hurt. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9083.72s)]
*  You know how sometimes you're just there [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9085.72s)]
*  and you're emotional, and that tear comes, [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9087.72s)]
*  and it's like, you're not sobbing, but [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9089.72s)]
*  I'm like, Trump's next video is [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9091.72s)]
*  a he's a cry. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9093.72s)]
*  Crying human. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9095.72s)]
*  Crying human. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9097.72s)]
*  He cried like a girl. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9099.72s)]
*  Please, Donald. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9101.72s)]
*  But yeah, so like, I get the little [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9103.72s)]
*  tear, go, my fucking contacts, you know. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9105.72s)]
*  But yeah, I was [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9107.72s)]
*  not a good employee. And then like I told you, you got [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9109.72s)]
*  the software job. I got your business software, got fired there. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9111.72s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9113.72s)]
*  I just wasn't. But at that point, [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9115.72s)]
*  you know, when I started that company, Microsolutions, [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9117.72s)]
*  after I got fired from your business [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9119.72s)]
*  software, I'm sleeping six guys in a [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9121.72s)]
*  three-bedroom apartment. I'm sleeping on the floor. I was [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9123.72s)]
*  the last one in, so I like, I didn't even [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9125.72s)]
*  have a drawer. I had nothing. So I had fucking [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9127.72s)]
*  nothing to lose, you know. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9129.72s)]
*  Literally, my car had broken down. That Fiat [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9131.72s)]
*  dusted. And the way I got a [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9133.72s)]
*  car, this is, [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9135.72s)]
*  with my buddies, we're driving up by Richling [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9137.72s)]
*  College. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9139.72s)]
*  We're driving by Richling College, [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9141.72s)]
*  and there's a fucking old school [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9143.72s)]
*  Trans Am on the side of the road. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9145.72s)]
*  And it's just sitting there. It's not [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9147.72s)]
*  wrecked. It's just, I'm like, I know for [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9149.72s)]
*  a fact, because my experience is, somebody [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9151.72s)]
*  didn't pay the note on that car. It's just [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9153.72s)]
*  sitting there. So I opened the door, [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9155.72s)]
*  and right there was the pink slip and all the loan [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9157.72s)]
*  information, right there on the seat of [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9159.72s)]
*  the car. I call it the bag. I said, my [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9161.72s)]
*  credit's for shit, right? But I found this car [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9163.72s)]
*  for you. Would you let me take over the [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9165.72s)]
*  payments? Wow. That's how I got a car. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9167.72s)]
*  Now, I don't make these arguments [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9169.72s)]
*  a lot, but like, if a black guy did that, [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9171.72s)]
*  he would be shot immediately. [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9173.72s)]
*  I'm not going to say [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9175.72s)]
*  that was a trick, man. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9177.72s)]
*  You just opened up somebody's car [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9179.72s)]
*  and it's a fuck. Well, there's nobody around. [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9181.72s)]
*  It wasn't like there were people there. It wasn't like it was [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9183.72s)]
*  in a lot. It was literally on the [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9185.72s)]
*  side of the road with nothing [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9187.72s)]
*  around. Nothing wrong. No, I'm not going to [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9189.72s)]
*  just like, [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9191.72s)]
*  even me, right? I'm not [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9193.72s)]
*  going to do that. It was on the side [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9195.72s)]
*  of the road. There was nobody [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9197.72s)]
*  around. Just be honest. You were about to steal the car [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9199.72s)]
*  and then you got lucky. That's what [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9201.72s)]
*  really happened. You saw a nice [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9203.72s)]
*  trans-am on the side of the road. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9205.72s)]
*  My hot-wiring skills were pretty good. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9207.72s)]
*  No. [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9209.72s)]
*  I'm curious. To young entrepreneurs [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9211.72s)]
*  or business owners, [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9213.72s)]
*  what advice would you give them to either [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9215.72s)]
*  scale or look for investors? [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9217.72s)]
*  Don't. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9219.72s)]
*  Don't scale or don't look for investors? [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9221.72s)]
*  Don't worry about it. You grow [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9223.72s)]
*  your business at the rate [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9225.72s)]
*  your business grows. If you're worried [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9227.72s)]
*  about it, everybody wants their business to grow bigger. [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9229.72s)]
*  You want to make more money. [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9231.72s)]
*  One of the biggest mistakes entrepreneurs [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9233.72s)]
*  make is they worry about the top line [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9235.72s)]
*  more than the bottom line. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9237.72s)]
*  Getting to a million dollars, [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9239.72s)]
*  that feels good. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9241.72s)]
*  If you're spending a million. Or if you're losing money or [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9243.72s)]
*  if you're hardly making any money, would you rather [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9245.72s)]
*  hit a million and five million and ten million [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9247.72s)]
*  and then be losing money because you're [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9249.72s)]
*  spending it on growth? Or would you rather do [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9251.72s)]
*  eight hundred thousand and put two hundred thousand in your pocket [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9253.72s)]
*  and then use that money to figure [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9255.72s)]
*  out how to grow more profitably? [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9257.72s)]
*  The biggest mistake they make [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9259.72s)]
*  is focusing on sales [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9261.72s)]
*  over profits. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9263.72s)]
*  Also, in terms of raising money, [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9265.72s)]
*  unless you are absolutely [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9267.72s)]
*  positive, you don't want to borrow money [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9269.72s)]
*  to start a business. It goes from [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9271.72s)]
*  being your business to the bank's [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9273.72s)]
*  business. The bank wants that payment [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9275.72s)]
*  back. If you don't pay it back, [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9277.72s)]
*  you're done and it's over. [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9279.72s)]
*  In terms of raising money, [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9281.72s)]
*  if you've invested in any of your friends' [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9283.72s)]
*  companies or invested in any companies, [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9285.72s)]
*  no. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9287.72s)]
*  I just have my own, but I'm asking you [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9289.72s)]
*  for me personally. But if somebody gives you money, [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9291.72s)]
*  or if you give somebody money, [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9293.72s)]
*  the expectation changes. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9295.72s)]
*  I would rather tell somebody, get a second [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9297.72s)]
*  job and save your money until you've got enough. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9299.72s)]
*  Now, if it's too expensive and it's too much, start [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9301.72s)]
*  smaller. If you need some equipment, [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9303.72s)]
*  like you need a mold that you have to pay for, [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9305.72s)]
*  and it's 60 grand to make the product that you want to make [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9307.72s)]
*  and send it out, [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9309.72s)]
*  then maybe, [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9311.72s)]
*  but the richest, [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9313.72s)]
*  richest, richest motherfuckers [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9315.72s)]
*  are the ones that own a big percentage of their [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9317.72s)]
*  companies. [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9319.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9321.72s)]
*  That makes sense. At the end of the day, [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9323.72s)]
*  all that blood, sweat, and tears that goes into it, [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9325.72s)]
*  you don't want to be coughing up 80% of it. [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9327.72s)]
*  Because other people gave you some money. [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9329.72s)]
*  Because to be a [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9331.72s)]
*  billionaire, there's one thing every billionaire has [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9333.72s)]
*  in common. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9335.72s)]
*  Luck. There's something that happened [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9337.72s)]
*  that made them lucky. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9339.72s)]
*  For me, like when we started the streaming [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9341.72s)]
*  business, this audio net, [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9343.72s)]
*  we had no idea where it was going, and then [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9345.72s)]
*  all of a sudden, the internet stock [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9347.72s)]
*  market just blew up. [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9349.72s)]
*  If the internet stock market hadn't blown up, [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9351.72s)]
*  I wouldn't be sitting here. [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9353.72s)]
*  It'd be like one of those sliding door movies, [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9355.72s)]
*  like, poof, you know, [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9357.72s)]
*  and I wouldn't be there. So you're saying it was the timing of [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9359.72s)]
*  the idea. Yeah, timing and the fact [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9361.72s)]
*  that the internet stock market blew up. [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9363.72s)]
*  Oh, because that purchase from Yahoo. [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9365.72s)]
*  Right, because we went public. [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9367.72s)]
*  We went public and [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9369.72s)]
*  we had the largest first [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9371.72s)]
*  day jump in stock price of any company [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9373.72s)]
*  in the history of the stock market when we went public. [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9375.72s)]
*  And all of a sudden, I was worth [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9377.72s)]
*  $350 million, and then [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9379.72s)]
*  the stock market just kept on going up, [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9381.72s)]
*  and up and up and up and up, and we were like, [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9383.72s)]
*  oh, fuck, me and my partner [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9385.72s)]
*  Todd, we could be billionaires. [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9387.72s)]
*  For real. I'll never forget. [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9389.72s)]
*  Never, ever, ever forget. So back in the day [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9391.72s)]
*  on a PC, like you use [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9393.72s)]
*  Yahoo Finance, and you know how you hit the [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9395.72s)]
*  F5 key to refresh? I'm [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9397.72s)]
*  getting up, I'm naked, I'm sitting in front of, [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9399.72s)]
*  standing in front of my PC, [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9401.72s)]
*  because I know I'm close, hit a billion, [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9403.72s)]
*  did my little naked billionaire dance, [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9405.72s)]
*  went back to work, but it takes [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9407.72s)]
*  a little luck, and I'll never forget [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9409.72s)]
*  that, you know, that moment. [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9411.72s)]
*  What was the expectation [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9413.72s)]
*  going into it? Did anybody [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9415.72s)]
*  say you guys could get the B? Okay, okay. [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9417.72s)]
*  We knew that was possible, because I remember having [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9419.72s)]
*  a meeting with our employees and saying, look, [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9421.72s)]
*  either this thing is going to be worth [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9423.72s)]
*  $5 billion or more, or we fucked [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9425.72s)]
*  it up, because the idea [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9427.72s)]
*  of taking audio and [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9429.72s)]
*  video and putting it on the internet, [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9431.72s)]
*  nobody was doing it at the time, and it wasn't [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9433.72s)]
*  like no one was going to think of it, but nobody [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9435.72s)]
*  was doing it, and we just went full bore, [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9437.72s)]
*  just balls to the wall, [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9439.72s)]
*  and you know, we were [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9441.72s)]
*  I mean, we were YouTube [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9443.72s)]
*  long before YouTube, like 10 years [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9445.72s)]
*  before YouTube even, 11 years before YouTube [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9447.72s)]
*  even started, and like we [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9449.72s)]
*  dominated, literally dominated [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9451.72s)]
*  all things multimedia on the [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9453.72s)]
*  internet. The first anything [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9455.72s)]
*  that's ever streamed, we did it, no doubt [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9457.72s)]
*  about it. Yeah, it was insane. So we knew, [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9459.72s)]
*  we were killing it, and [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9461.72s)]
*  but then when Yahoo comes [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9463.72s)]
*  along and offers us, you know, [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9465.72s)]
*  $5.7 billion in stock. [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9467.72s)]
*  So they offered you $5.7 billion [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9469.72s)]
*  in Yahoo stock. You get [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9471.72s)]
*  the Yahoo stock. Do you [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9473.72s)]
*  liquidate? I couldn't. For how long? [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9475.72s)]
*  Six months. And so what I did [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9477.72s)]
*  was I took every penny that I had, [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9479.72s)]
*  and I checked with my lawyers, [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9481.72s)]
*  and I shorted the [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9483.72s)]
*  internet index, [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9485.72s)]
*  and because it only as a protection [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9487.72s)]
*  for your five points, every penny [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9489.72s)]
*  I had. So it's like taking insurance out on your [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9491.72s)]
*  NBA contract. Yeah, exactly. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9493.72s)]
*  Oh boy. So just in case [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9495.72s)]
*  the internet bubble pops, [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9497.72s)]
*  you're protected on the opposite [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9499.72s)]
*  side. Did it pop in that time? [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9501.72s)]
*  Well, not that time, right? So I lost that money. [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9503.72s)]
*  But what I did immediately when I was allowed [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9505.72s)]
*  to sell [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9507.72s)]
*  it, because I couldn't sell [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9509.72s)]
*  it all at once, it was just [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9511.72s)]
*  crater of the market, whatever, I did something [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9513.72s)]
*  called a hedge. And what the hedge is, [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9515.72s)]
*  you can sell options. So I sold call [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9517.72s)]
*  options, which gives somebody else, [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9519.72s)]
*  somebody paid me for the right to buy [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9521.72s)]
*  my shares of stock at a higher [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9523.72s)]
*  price at some point in the future. And I [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9525.72s)]
*  took that money, and I used it to buy [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9527.72s)]
*  puts, which protected me in case [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9529.72s)]
*  the price of my stock went down. [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9531.72s)]
*  And so this is like, yeah, [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9533.72s)]
*  and it was called. So when [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9535.72s)]
*  it popped, when it popped, [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9537.72s)]
*  I actually made more money. It was called [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9539.72s)]
*  one of the top 10 trades on Wall Street [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9541.72s)]
*  in Wall Street history. Okay, so you made [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9543.72s)]
*  5.7 billion. Yeah, 5.7 [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9545.72s)]
*  wasn't all mine. So I made like a third of it. [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9547.72s)]
*  Okay, so you're at 1.9 [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9549.72s)]
*  minus taxes and bullshit. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9551.72s)]
*  But it's [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9553.72s)]
*  you're not being taxed yet, right? Because [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9555.72s)]
*  I hadn't sold it. But yeah. So of that [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9557.72s)]
*  1.9, how much do you make when [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9559.72s)]
*  you short it? So [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9561.72s)]
*  when I short it, I lost the [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9563.72s)]
*  $27 million. When I shorted the index, [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9565.72s)]
*  which was the first protection, [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9567.72s)]
*  I lost all that money. That's fine. [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9569.72s)]
*  I was happy about that. It's good. [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9571.72s)]
*  You'd rather keep the stock. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9573.72s)]
*  Because then, like the next day, [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9575.72s)]
*  I could put on the hedge, which [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9577.72s)]
*  the sell the calls and buy the puts. And that [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9579.72s)]
*  worked out over three years [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9581.72s)]
*  because I didn't want it all coming in. So it [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9583.72s)]
*  was all planned out over three years. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9585.72s)]
*  And pre-tax, [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9587.72s)]
*  I probably made an extra [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9589.72s)]
*  $30-40 million just [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9591.72s)]
*  because of that. So you got your 1.9 [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9593.72s)]
*  out. Plus the next [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9595.72s)]
*  $30-40. Yeah, plus a little big. [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9597.72s)]
*  And then it wasn't all at once. [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9599.72s)]
*  It was like over three years. And then I had to pay [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9601.72s)]
*  the taxes and all that stuff, which I was glad [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9603.72s)]
*  to do. So you pay the taxes, let's [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9605.72s)]
*  say you... Let me just tell you, right in a [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9607.72s)]
*  $250 million check. [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9609.72s)]
*  Oh no, because it's what, 20% the corporate [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9611.72s)]
*  tax rate or something like that? Well, back then it was even more. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9613.72s)]
*  Back then it was even more. Which is, I didn't care. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9615.72s)]
*  I didn't fucking... Yeah, I was like... [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9617.72s)]
*  You got the fuck you money. Hey, I got the fuck you money. [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9619.72s)]
*  Yeah. Do you... [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9621.72s)]
*  And I know we got to wrap this up soon, [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9623.72s)]
*  but when you make all the money that you [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9625.72s)]
*  ever needed, did you go through a time where [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9627.72s)]
*  you were concerned about [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9629.72s)]
*  motivation, where you were concerned about [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9631.72s)]
*  what you wanted to do with the rest of your life? [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9633.72s)]
*  Was there ever a sadness that came over you? [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9635.72s)]
*  No, not really, because I mean, [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9637.72s)]
*  I'm competitive. I like to compete. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9639.72s)]
*  So you knew that you had to channel that into something [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9641.72s)]
*  else. You weren't like, I'm going to retire until I'm on the beach. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9643.72s)]
*  If anything, everybody gets imposter syndrome [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9645.72s)]
*  at some level, [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9647.72s)]
*  including me. And so it was like, okay, [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9649.72s)]
*  can I do it again? [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9651.72s)]
*  It's so interesting. Even doing it once, you're like, [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9653.72s)]
*  did I just get lucky? Can I do it again? [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9655.72s)]
*  You win the NBA championship, that's still [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9657.72s)]
*  not enough. You got to keep going. So at a certain [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9659.72s)]
*  point, when you have fuck you money, [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9661.72s)]
*  your family's good, everyone around you is good, [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9663.72s)]
*  you still have to keep on [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9665.72s)]
*  getting back on the bike to be a human [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9667.72s)]
*  being. Meaning, you can't just [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9669.72s)]
*  sit back, relax, because that's what I'm talking about. [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9671.72s)]
*  Not me anyways, not me. Different people are different. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9673.72s)]
*  I guess some people can write a book or [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9675.72s)]
*  do other bullshit. But to me, business [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9677.72s)]
*  is a sport. You enjoy the [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9679.72s)]
*  act of it. I tell people, [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9681.72s)]
*  if you're going to compete with me, I'm going to [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9683.72s)]
*  fuck you up. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9685.72s)]
*  It's like, I'll still go out there and pretend [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9687.72s)]
*  to play basketball. [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9689.72s)]
*  I can't do what I used to, but at the same time, [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9691.72s)]
*  I still want to compete. And if someone wants to [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9693.72s)]
*  bang with me in the pan, I'll bang. I don't care if [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9695.72s)]
*  you're 20 years old. Let's [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9697.72s)]
*  compete. That's interesting. [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9699.72s)]
*  And I think that's a good mentality, because I think there are [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9701.72s)]
*  people that reach certain levels of success, [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9703.72s)]
*  and then they retire. I think they're kind of miserable. [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9705.72s)]
*  I don't get that at all. Have you experienced that? [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9707.72s)]
*  I've talked to other people that I'm retired. [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9709.72s)]
*  Some of my friends that I grew up with, it's not that [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9711.72s)]
*  they made a lot of money, but they worked [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9713.72s)]
*  a job the whole time, and [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9715.72s)]
*  now they're retiring. I'm like, [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9717.72s)]
*  what the fuck is that? [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9719.72s)]
*  What are you going to do? They didn't love the job. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9721.72s)]
*  Yeah, I love what I do. What are you going to do? [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9723.72s)]
*  Jerk off all day? Here's my Tadilafil [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9725.72s)]
*  for 90 minutes. [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9727.72s)]
*  That is interesting. Falling in love [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9731.72s)]
*  with the process, [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9733.72s)]
*  and then just transferring that process to a new goal. [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9735.72s)]
*  It's like sports. You guys play sports, and you just get [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9737.72s)]
*  into it. Why do you go and play pick-up [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9739.72s)]
*  all the time? A couple [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9741.72s)]
*  of reasons. That sound and that feel, the ball [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9743.72s)]
*  going through the hoop, [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9745.72s)]
*  and then just the competition. [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9747.72s)]
*  Talk trash, you're out there. [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9749.72s)]
*  That's the beauty of pick-up. You can go anywhere [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9751.72s)]
*  in the world, and [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9753.72s)]
*  hoop, and play, and people all know the same rules. [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9755.72s)]
*  You talk [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9757.72s)]
*  some trash, but not too much, [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9759.72s)]
*  and bullshit, but if you win, [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9761.72s)]
*  it feels good. [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9763.72s)]
*  The weekend is made. [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9765.72s)]
*  Business is the same way to me. [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9767.72s)]
*  That's good advice. [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9769.72s)]
*  I think a lot of us, especially [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9771.72s)]
*  in entertainment, you're like, okay, I'm going to get [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9773.72s)]
*  to this point, and then once I do that, [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9775.72s)]
*  I don't have to do anything else. It's like, no, the [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9777.72s)]
*  joy has always been the craft. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9779.72s)]
*  Plus, as you get older, it's harder [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9781.72s)]
*  in entertainment, right? Because it's harder [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9783.72s)]
*  to connect and relate. The audience [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9785.72s)]
*  changes, your audience matures, and [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9787.72s)]
*  everybody goes through that. Do you know [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9789.72s)]
*  I've been nominated for six Oscars [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9791.72s)]
*  and won an Emmy? Smartest guy in the room? [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9793.72s)]
*  Yeah. For what? [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9795.72s)]
*  First movie ever greenlit. So I got an email [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9797.72s)]
*  from the student named Alex Gibney, a director. [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9799.72s)]
*  He goes, I have this video [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9801.72s)]
*  from this company called Enron. [[02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9803.72s)]
*  I know who Enron is, and he's like, [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9805.72s)]
*  yeah, show some shady shit. [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9807.72s)]
*  I'm like, you own the video? He's like, [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9809.72s)]
*  yeah. And I'm like, what's the [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9811.72s)]
*  budget for this documentary? He goes, [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9813.72s)]
*  $770,000. I'm like, [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9815.72s)]
*  I'll do that. And so I literally [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9817.72s)]
*  greenlit it in 12 minutes, and he [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9819.72s)]
*  creates this documentary called Enron, the [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9821.72s)]
*  Smartest Guys in the Room, which is insanely [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9823.72s)]
*  good. It's great. It's great. [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9825.72s)]
*  Actually great. Yeah, and back then [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9827.72s)]
*  it was a top 10 documentary in [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9829.72s)]
*  revenues. It's not close now. [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9831.72s)]
*  But got nominated for an Academy Award. [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9833.72s)]
*  Then the next fucking year, right, [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9835.72s)]
*  my partner Todd says, we're going to invest in [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9837.72s)]
*  this movie. Are you in? I'm like, sure. It's [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9839.72s)]
*  about the McCarthy trials. [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9841.72s)]
*  And it's in black and white. [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9843.72s)]
*  And it's got George Clooney and all these [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9845.72s)]
*  other folks. And it's called Good [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9847.72s)]
*  Night and Good Luck. Good Night and Good Luck [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9849.72s)]
*  gets nominated for six Academy [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9851.72s)]
*  Awards. We didn't fucking win any [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9853.72s)]
*  of them, but we had an Academy [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9855.72s)]
*  Awards party at Dan Tanna's. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9857.72s)]
*  And I swear I was doing body shots [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9859.72s)]
*  on Cindy Crawford, sitting [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9861.72s)]
*  next to Madonna trying to [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9863.72s)]
*  get her to do shots. It made she wouldn't do it. [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9865.72s)]
*  It was my pregnant wife [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9867.72s)]
*  was sitting right there. [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9869.72s)]
*  Trooper. [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9871.72s)]
*  Trooper. Yeah. [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9873.72s)]
*  It was insane. I remember that time. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9875.72s)]
*  I remember just you had like a real Midas touch. [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9877.72s)]
*  Everything was just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9879.72s)]
*  Yeah. But then you haven't heard of any [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9881.72s)]
*  of the other movies we've done since then. [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9883.72s)]
*  Sharknado 3. Sharknado 3? [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9885.72s)]
*  The best thing ever. [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9887.72s)]
*  The best thing about that movie, right, [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9889.72s)]
*  I told him you couldn't kill me. You cannot kill me [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9891.72s)]
*  because if there's going to be another [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9893.72s)]
*  one I want to be able to come back. You want to be in Sharknado 4. [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9895.72s)]
*  You cannot be in Sharknado 4. Watching [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9897.72s)]
*  them kill everybody else. So like Lou [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9899.72s)]
*  Ferrigno, the Hulk, right? [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9901.72s)]
*  He's like a security guard and he [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9903.72s)]
*  died for protection for the president. [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9905.72s)]
*  And he dies. And so you have to [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9907.72s)]
*  go through this whole thing to die before they put the [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9909.72s)]
*  special effects. And so there's fucking [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9911.72s)]
*  Lou Ferrigno and [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9913.72s)]
*  Rick Fox and all these [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9915.72s)]
*  others. And they're laying on the floor going [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9917.72s)]
*  that's the funniest shit ever. [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9919.72s)]
*  So yeah, Sharknado 3 was [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9921.72s)]
*  a moment in history. [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9923.72s)]
*  The happiest [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9925.72s)]
*  moment outside [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9927.72s)]
*  of family, kids, etc. Is it [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9929.72s)]
*  the NBA championship? Yeah. [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9931.72s)]
*  Yeah. No, I'd [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9933.72s)]
*  say the picture of you at the urinal holding [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9935.72s)]
*  the Larry Friar trophy is fucking iconic. [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9937.72s)]
*  You know what? I would say [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9939.72s)]
*  getting the money from broadcast.com was [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9941.72s)]
*  number one. The NBA was number two. [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9943.72s)]
*  Yeah. Because that's [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9945.72s)]
*  opened the door to everybody else, everything else. [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9947.72s)]
*  But yeah, I remember. So [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9949.72s)]
*  I had to piss. We were just drinking beer. [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9951.72s)]
*  And I [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9953.72s)]
*  walk in to take a piss and I have [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9955.72s)]
*  the trophy. And I'm thinking, and there's [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9957.72s)]
*  cameras behind me and I'm thinking, if someone [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9959.72s)]
*  gets a picture of this, it's going to be iconic. [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9961.72s)]
*  The best picture ever. And there's literally a picture [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9963.72s)]
*  of me like, yep. [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9965.72s)]
*  Can you get it up? [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9967.72s)]
*  Joey's on the screen. Oh, he got it. [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9969.72s)]
*  The greatest picture of all time. Okay, so that's [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9971.72s)]
*  the first big sale is the best [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9973.72s)]
*  feeling. But the championship was amazing. [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9975.72s)]
*  Because there's so many variables. [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9977.72s)]
*  Let me just tell you, it was also anticlimactic. [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9979.72s)]
*  Why? Because [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9981.72s)]
*  you know, it was like, it [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9983.72s)]
*  happens. And [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9985.72s)]
*  Oh, you guys did it in Miami, didn't you? [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9987.72s)]
*  Oh, that's right. It wasn't at all. [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9989.72s)]
*  Dude, I watched that game with you at a friend's house. [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9991.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. And Dirk was just unbelievable. [[02:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9993.72s)]
*  Unreal. And he just carried the whole [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9995.72s)]
*  it was. By far the best player ever. [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9997.72s)]
*  But now, yeah, there we go. Now he's talking. [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=9999.72s)]
*  He started what? 1 of 11 in game six. [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10001.72s)]
*  And I'm so used to Heartbreak as a Dallas sports fan. [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10003.72s)]
*  And I'm like, are we fucking what's going on? [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10005.72s)]
*  But then he came back the second half. [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10007.72s)]
*  But like, I'll never forget. [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10009.72s)]
*  So the worst part of it, like I'm [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10011.72s)]
*  super stupid, stitious, like beyond [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10013.72s)]
*  belief. And so if you ever watched [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10015.72s)]
*  any highlights and they show me from [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10017.72s)]
*  that series, I'm sitting there like this. I've got a [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10019.72s)]
*  Diet Coke right here. And every time [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10021.72s)]
*  we have the ball, I have to take a sip of the Diet [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10023.72s)]
*  Coke and put [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10025.72s)]
*  it down and straighten out the straw. [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10027.72s)]
*  Because if I don't, we won't make the hoop. [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10029.72s)]
*  I love it. [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10031.72s)]
*  And so my face at the beginning [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10033.72s)]
*  of the game is like this. By the end of the game, [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10035.72s)]
*  my face is like this. [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10037.72s)]
*  For sure. [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10039.72s)]
*  For sure. [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10041.72s)]
*  For sure. But [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10043.72s)]
*  we get there and we [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10045.72s)]
*  make a bucket. There we go. That [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10047.72s)]
*  is a fucking fire picture, dude. [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10049.72s)]
*  Yep. And so we get this [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10051.72s)]
*  bucket to go up ten by like [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10053.72s)]
*  with like 31 seconds to go. Yeah. [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10055.72s)]
*  And I'm like, oh. It was a leaning [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10057.72s)]
*  I think. Yeah. Dirk shot over [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10059.72s)]
*  Sposh. And I'm like, oh my god. [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10061.72s)]
*  We're going to win. And I [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10063.72s)]
*  and Brendan Heywood was here. Brian [[02:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10065.72s)]
*  Grant, a guy who works with, was there. [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10067.72s)]
*  Deshawn Stevenson was right there. [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10069.72s)]
*  And I've got my arms around him and they're just holding me up and I'm just [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10071.72s)]
*  screaming at the top of my lungs. [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10073.72s)]
*  Because the best part about it [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10075.72s)]
*  was the stress release. [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10077.72s)]
*  Because the uncertainty of whether or not [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10079.72s)]
*  you're going to win, like we had fucked up in 2006. [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10081.72s)]
*  And you just don't know. [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10083.72s)]
*  And just that release. [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10085.72s)]
*  That moment of screaming at [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10087.72s)]
*  the top of my lungs was the best [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10089.72s)]
*  part. You screamed before the game was over? [[02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10091.72s)]
*  It was over. 30 seconds. It was over. [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10093.72s)]
*  I'm a Knicks fan. [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10095.72s)]
*  30 seconds is a [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10097.72s)]
*  lifetime. [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10099.72s)]
*  That's Reggie Miller, right? [[02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10101.72s)]
*  Not only did I lose 2006, 2007, [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10103.72s)]
*  I don't know if you all remember, you remember, there were 67 [[02:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10105.72s)]
*  and 15, best team in the league. Everybody [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10107.72s)]
*  thought, OK, this is the year they got it. [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10109.72s)]
*  First round, I'm watching the whole thing, dude. [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10111.72s)]
*  I'm a Mavs fan. We're losing to Golden State [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10113.72s)]
*  just getting dominated. And that's when I was like, [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10115.72s)]
*  it was a foregone conclusion to me we're going to [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10117.72s)]
*  win this year. What the fuck is happening? [[02:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10119.72s)]
*  We don't own the MVP. [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10121.72s)]
*  Because the team we played was our [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10123.72s)]
*  former coach. Yeah, Don. So he had [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10125.72s)]
*  all the ins and outs every week. [[02:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10127.72s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. But when [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10129.72s)]
*  you win, like I remember going [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10131.72s)]
*  on the court, hugging everybody [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10133.72s)]
*  and just screaming. And [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10135.72s)]
*  then it was like, [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10137.72s)]
*  let's [[02:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10139.72s)]
*  party. Yeah. But, and the [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10141.72s)]
*  party was good. But, you know, but it wasn't like [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10143.72s)]
*  it was like world [[02:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10145.72s)]
*  change. It wasn't like the clouds opened up. [[02:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10147.72s)]
*  The angels. More stress release than [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10149.72s)]
*  anything else. It was almost [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10151.72s)]
*  anticlimactic once we won. [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10153.72s)]
*  Once and a half. Yeah. That was the happiest [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10155.72s)]
*  I've been as a sports fan my entire life. Because when the Cowboys [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10157.72s)]
*  won Super Bowls, I was too young to know. [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10159.72s)]
*  I was like, oh, that's what you do. [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10161.72s)]
*  The Cowboys go to the Super Bowl. I've seen every [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10163.72s)]
*  heartache. I've seen them be shitty in the 90s [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10165.72s)]
*  before he bought them. So I remember [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10167.72s)]
*  being like, oh, this could never happen again. [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10169.72s)]
*  I'd be happy. [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10171.72s)]
*  Was there like a player on the team you were really happy [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10173.72s)]
*  for? Was there someone who you found? J.K. [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10175.72s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And Dirk. [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10177.72s)]
*  Yeah. Those two guys. Because [[02:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10179.72s)]
*  J.K. was 38 and Dirk [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10181.72s)]
*  was 32. Yeah. And so like [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10183.72s)]
*  it comes so close, comes so close, comes [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10185.72s)]
*  so close. And so for both of them, [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10187.72s)]
*  I was really happy. That's why we built a fucking [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10189.72s)]
*  statue for Dirk. Yeah. That was awesome. [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10191.72s)]
*  Is there a really like behind the scenes [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10193.72s)]
*  story that nobody knows from that championship [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10195.72s)]
*  run? Or maybe just even the craziest thing you've seen [[02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10197.72s)]
*  as an owner that you feel comfortable [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10199.72s)]
*  talking about? Shit. [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10201.72s)]
*  There's so many things. [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10203.72s)]
*  But just from that run, [[02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10207.72s)]
*  one of the things, it wasn't crazy, [[02:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10211.72s)]
*  but it was just cool that everybody [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10213.72s)]
*  got together and said, we're wearing [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10215.72s)]
*  black on game six. Oh, before game six. [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10217.72s)]
*  Yeah, before game six because you wear black to a funeral. [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10219.72s)]
*  And I was like, oh, [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10221.72s)]
*  okay. [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10223.72s)]
*  Let me get it. That's a confidence thing. [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10225.72s)]
*  It's a cock. [[02:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10227.72s)]
*  Because that backfires. [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10229.72s)]
*  It really, because I've seen it since then. [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10231.72s)]
*  I don't know if we were the first, but we were one of the [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10233.72s)]
*  first. And since then, I've seen it backfired. [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10235.72s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And if that backfires, [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10237.72s)]
*  it could break you for game seven. [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10239.72s)]
*  There's this public embarrassment. [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10241.72s)]
*  Whose idea was the? I don't even know. [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10243.72s)]
*  I don't even know. But then I would assume Tyson [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10245.72s)]
*  Chandler. Yeah. Shout out to TC. [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10247.72s)]
*  Because I was doing interviews and walking [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10249.72s)]
*  by the locker room and you know, they [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10251.72s)]
*  just started the champagne and everything. [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10253.72s)]
*  And I didn't know what I didn't want to miss. But Tyson, [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10255.72s)]
*  I had no idea. So Tyson [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10257.72s)]
*  saw me and goes, Cube, get your ass in. [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10259.72s)]
*  He drags me, drags me in there. And [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10261.72s)]
*  that, yeah, that was also [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10263.72s)]
*  one of the best moments when you're like doing the, [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10265.72s)]
*  you know, what you see on TV everywhere. [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10267.72s)]
*  The champagne, screaming, [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10269.72s)]
*  and the goggles or whatever. [[02:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10271.72s)]
*  Everybody getting soaking wet. I remember I knew how [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10273.72s)]
*  Euforica was for you. A postgame [[02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10275.72s)]
*  interview, you just go, shout out to the Dallas [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10277.72s)]
*  fans. We pumped the shit out of Miami. [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10279.72s)]
*  I can't believe it. [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10281.72s)]
*  I can't believe it. I remember. It was [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10283.72s)]
*  live on TV. I watch every minute [[02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10285.72s)]
*  of the postgame. I'm a Dallas fan. I was drunk as fuck. [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10287.72s)]
*  I was drunk as fuck. [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10289.72s)]
*  And caffeinated. [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10291.72s)]
*  I was [[02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10293.72s)]
*  drunk as fuck because [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10295.72s)]
*  we had the champagne and the beer and [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10297.72s)]
*  I was just pouring it. Hannah Storm was so confused [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10299.72s)]
*  because she was like, alright. [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10301.72s)]
*  And I told her, I even [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10303.72s)]
*  said it. I might curse because I'm a little bit [[02:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10305.72s)]
*  and she's like, whatever is life. [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10307.72s)]
*  You gotta let that rip. NBA champion, man. [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10309.72s)]
*  OK, follow up. [[02:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10311.72s)]
*  What do you need to do that again [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10313.72s)]
*  for this team with Luca? [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10315.72s)]
*  Clay Thompson. You think that's [[02:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10317.72s)]
*  it? I think that's a big difference. Look, the West [[02:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10319.72s)]
*  is so tough. But we'll be better [[02:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10321.72s)]
*  than we were last year. Derrick Lively had an [[02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10323.72s)]
*  incredible rookie season. He's going to be [[02:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10325.72s)]
*  better. PJ Washington [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10327.72s)]
*  and Gaff, we got midseason. [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10329.72s)]
*  They'll have more time with us. They'll be better. [[02:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10331.72s)]
*  Kyrie and Luca will be Kyrie [[02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10333.72s)]
*  and Luca. And then, [[02:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10335.72s)]
*  Jane Hardy will be better. But [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10337.72s)]
*  you add Clay Thompson. [[02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10339.72s)]
*  And Golden State, [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10341.72s)]
*  they had to have him on the run. He had to be in motion [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10343.72s)]
*  all the time with us. Because [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10345.72s)]
*  Luca and Ky can create for other people. [[02:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10347.72s)]
*  You just need to stay in the corner. Just stand in the corner. [[02:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10349.72s)]
*  Just stay in an open spot where you're most comfortable. [[02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10351.72s)]
*  It's not like Steph couldn't do it. [[02:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10353.72s)]
*  It's just not their offense. [[02:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10355.72s)]
*  Your offense is motion. [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10357.72s)]
*  And so I think that's really going to be. [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10359.72s)]
*  And also, Luca and Ky just demand so much [[02:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10361.72s)]
*  attention. So much. And then defensively, [[02:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10363.72s)]
*  where our season really turned around last year, [[02:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10365.72s)]
*  is when we made the decision [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10367.72s)]
*  to always have either Gaff or [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10369.72s)]
*  Derek Lively on the court. So we always [[02:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10371.72s)]
*  had a shot like that. That changed [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10373.72s)]
*  everything. Everything. [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10375.72s)]
*  Because we went from 26 and 23 [[02:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10377.72s)]
*  to like, getting to the playoffs [[02:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10379.72s)]
*  and doing some damage. [[02:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10381.72s)]
*  And so that was, [[02:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10383.72s)]
*  I think when you bring that back, [[02:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10385.72s)]
*  we get a little bit more cohesion. Because [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10387.72s)]
*  even though it was the playoffs, you don't have a lot of time [[02:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10389.72s)]
*  to practice. So we'll be better. [[02:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10391.72s)]
*  The problem is, the entire Western Conference is going to be bad. [[02:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10393.72s)]
*  They're fucking good. I'm really astonished [[02:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10395.72s)]
*  you all recovered from the Jalen Brunson [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10397.72s)]
*  departure. Yeah, I mean, [[02:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10399.72s)]
*  Jalen, to his credit, [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10401.72s)]
*  just got a lot better. [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10403.72s)]
*  You know, I did hit their podcast just [[02:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10405.72s)]
*  because Jalen asked me. And [[02:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10407.72s)]
*  he [[02:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10409.72s)]
*  wasn't as good, [[02:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10411.72s)]
*  nearly as good. Yeah, if he was the same player [[02:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10413.72s)]
*  he is today, we would have maxed him out. [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10415.72s)]
*  I mean, we saw a little glimpse, I think, in [[02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10417.72s)]
*  that playoff run. [[02:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10419.72s)]
*  He dropped like four in one game. [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10421.72s)]
*  He had a good game against Phoenix. [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10423.72s)]
*  And then we lost to Golden State. But I remember thinking, [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10425.72s)]
*  I didn't think it would be this. But it seemed like he just wanted to go to the next round. [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10427.72s)]
*  He wanted his own team. [[02:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10429.72s)]
*  For sure. He wanted his own team. He's always going to be [[02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10431.72s)]
*  second to Luca. Just give us something. [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10433.72s)]
*  We'll take something. [[02:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10435.72s)]
*  I don't know if you took that paint cut though. [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10437.72s)]
*  I'm telling you what, we would have paid him more. [[02:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10439.72s)]
*  But that's, you know. [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10441.72s)]
*  Explain this. My understanding is, [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10443.72s)]
*  one, it's amazing that he's even willing to do it. [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10445.72s)]
*  But is he also basically [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10447.72s)]
*  holding out for the new CBA, where [[02:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10449.72s)]
*  he'll be able to get [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10451.72s)]
*  like, half a billion dollars? [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10453.72s)]
*  I mean, he hasn't told me this. I'm just guessing. [[02:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10455.72s)]
*  But he's like 28 now. [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10457.72s)]
*  And so, he did a [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10459.72s)]
*  three-year deal, I think. [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10461.72s)]
*  Two or three. Two and an option. [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10463.72s)]
*  So he'll probably opt out. So he's 30, which is [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10465.72s)]
*  he's young enough. The new CBA kicks in. [[02:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10467.72s)]
*  And then the daughter's going to be insane. [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10469.72s)]
*  You don't want to have the five-year deal where [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10471.72s)]
*  now you're 33 and ask him [[02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10473.72s)]
*  for another five years. You're a small point guy. [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10475.72s)]
*  Exactly. And I'm sure you could buy [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10477.72s)]
*  that insurance thing. I don't know if players [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10479.72s)]
*  always did this, but the idea that you could insure [[02:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10481.72s)]
*  against. No, you can and you do. [[02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10483.72s)]
*  That's so smart. Like, the teams pretty much [[02:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10485.72s)]
*  have to insure their top four players. [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10487.72s)]
*  Well, the teams insure for themselves, but the players [[02:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10489.72s)]
*  are starting to insure. No, and they know that. [[02:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10491.72s)]
*  Yeah, they get that. Like, what a smart [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTHmqbbFOQ&t=10493.72s)]
