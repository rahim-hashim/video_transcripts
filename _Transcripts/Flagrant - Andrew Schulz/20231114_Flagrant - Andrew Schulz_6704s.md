*  Uh, ilia toporia versus alexander vulcanovsky in february. Yep. If ilia goes out there and beats volk [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=462.15999999999997s)]
*  I would like to go up to 45. Yeah, so I think that's a big thing. You said you don't really want to fight volk [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=467.84s)]
*  Yeah, but he's saying he would want to go if he wins if he gets the job done [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=473.03999999999996s)]
*  I think volks coming back a little too soon [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=477.2s)]
*  Really from getting knocked out have you have you felt uh, have you felt what what volk was talking about ever where you're like [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=479.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=486.32s)]
*  What is that? I I feel like I I don't feel it too much unless I can't train like dealing with injuries [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=487.44s)]
*  Like if I can go out there and train really hard and grapple and just do it like get that [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=493.03999999999996s)]
*  That uh release of that energy out. I feel fine [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=497.59999999999997s)]
*  But if I was dealing with like an injury and you can't train really hard [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=500.88s)]
*  I feel like that's when I feel it but what is what is the feeling? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=503.59999999999997s)]
*  I think it's just not preparing for a fight. It's just kind of feel like you don't have a purpose. Yeah, but I think that's just I mean [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=507.20000000000005s)]
*  I've always bring it back to meditation, but I do think there's like something in that [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=515.12s)]
*  How was the other thing I was surprised about when we were over when we were in phoenix hanging with you guys? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=519.36s)]
*  was uh [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=523.6800000000001s)]
*  I think that you give the illusion [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=524.96s)]
*  That you're hanging you're smoking you're beating up the dummy in the backyard whatever [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=528.32s)]
*  And then I don't want to give away too much of how the sausage is made [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=532.9599999999999s)]
*  But like you going through like your regimen how strict it is the things you're doing for mental health the things you're doing for physical health [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=535.92s)]
*  It was [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=543.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's no accident. Yeah. No, I think it's a good message to spread and tell people about but [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=544.16s)]
*  It's not sexy like people aren't if it was just that people don't follow that too much [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=550.2399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so I think uh, I like spreading it out a little bit telling people about it [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=554.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good one. There's a platform to put it on. Okay. Championship. Championship. Championship drugs and bitches [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=559.1999999999999s)]

*  Month like tell me how long it lasts the high eventually. I'm sure you start to get into okay [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=577.12s)]
*  I have to prepare for this next fight. How long is a high? What is the high like? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=581.76s)]
*  No, to be honest, I was I was I felt I felt like I was kind of champ before before the belt [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=585.84s)]
*  I really truly believe I was the biggest name in the division. Yeah, my fight versus peter yawn was huge [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=591.2800000000001s)]
*  Yep, my fight versus uh, Pedro Munoz was big didn't play out. You know, it's a big [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=596.08s)]
*  Build-up the expectation for you is always big. Yeah, I felt like I've been champed [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=600.88s)]
*  So when I won the belt in that spectacular fashion though, there was it was nice. But as far as like how did I feel? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=605.2800000000001s)]
*  I [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=611.36s)]
*  Just feel like a fucking normal dude. I want to feel cool as fuck and feel like I'm champ, but I just don't [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=612.48s)]
*  Know nothing still feels like a I still feel like I have so much that I need to do [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=618.0799999999999s)]
*  I have to defend the belt. I think you need to defend the belt for your champ [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=622.9599999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=627.12s)]
*  So I still feel like I have so much to do and so much I want to accomplish that I don't feel like [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=627.92s)]
*  Uh, which is a good thing [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=632.4s)]
*  I think because if I felt like I'm like I did it I fucking did it and didn't have that drive anymore [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=634.16s)]

*  and uh [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=883.36s)]
*  Beating up Cheetos next but as far as business wise goes, how do you how do you how does the Cheeto fight go? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=884.8000000000001s)]
*  What do you think? What do you think? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=888.88s)]
*  I mean, let me think you you think while I talk. Okay, you go you go you go you go [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=893.44s)]
*  I'm gonna do the thinking. Yeah, I think you know stylistically [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=897.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, I and I think about I think this about anybody if i'm gonna be if i'm faster than you that's why the corey [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=901.44s)]
*  Fight so interesting because i'm not I don't know if necessarily faster [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=906.48s)]
*  I think it's pretty equal but I feel like if i'm faster than someone it's gonna be [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=909.9200000000001s)]
*  I can i'm gonna beat him and uh, I think you know, i'm just be fast too fast for cheeto. He's he's [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=913.1999999999999s)]
*  He's he's tough. He's very durable. Yeah, you know, I'm cardio is great cardio is good [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=919.84s)]
*  I'm not taking anything away from his hard fight. Does he great dresser? Yeah [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=924.24s)]
*  Uh a lot of things. Yeah [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=930.16s)]
*  Is there a mental component going into a fight with someone that technically beat you even though there was a obviously a body malfunction [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=931.84s)]
*  Maybe if if he would have beat me in like a three round fight and went to decision and he's just like beat my ass [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=938.4s)]
*  That'd be like that'd be different. That'd probably be harder like for cheeto to fight corey again [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=942.9599999999999s)]
*  Like remember when corey fucked cheeto up like for five rounds bad remember that [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=946.9599999999999s)]
*  You guys all remember that yeah [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=952.64s)]
*  So i'm saying like if that would have happened like it would have been doubted like fuck like going into a rematch would be tough [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=954.4s)]
*  But I just like the fact that I watched the fight back [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=958.56s)]
*  I was smoking him kick that fucking nerve roll my bitch ass ankle like four times [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=961.28s)]
*  And I was still piecing him up with one foot. Yeah, I blitzed him hit him with a seven piece [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=966.1600000000001s)]
*  I stepped back and my ankle goes whoop [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=971.2s)]
*  Whoop. Oh, wow. Yeah. Yeah my ankles gave out and fucking [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=973.6s)]

*  You know battle any demons. Yeah. Yeah [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=982.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the mental part of seems seems I thought I assumed it would be tough [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=985.2s)]
*  But I feel like technically you'll be able to edge him out. I rewatched that fight today [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=988.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and seeing you even battling through the nerve going you could tell when it happened bro [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=992.32s)]
*  Yeah, what happens then are you like a fuck or you were like, you know what? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=997.2800000000001s)]
*  I think because it's happened to people in the past but they're they're the nerve comes back [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=1000.1600000000001s)]
*  My my ankle wrap was too tight and I remember having my coach in the back telling him before we walked out [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=1004.48s)]
*  I'm like, hey, we try to loosen this up. This shit was so fucking tight [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=1008.8800000000001s)]
*  So when you kick that nerve, I just don't think it was like able to come back [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=1012.1600000000001s)]
*  I didn't know it comes back in the same day. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's happened to it happened [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=1016.0s)]

*  Um, so if I think if I could have made it to the end of the round [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=1037.68s)]
*  I think it might have came back but my ankle wraps were so fucking tight that I think it just shut it off [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=1040.8s)]
*  So who don't want some smoke, huh? He says he does bro [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=1046.24s)]

*  I just love telling him [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=1055.28s)]

*  Out of two did he go for two shots? He did [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=1085.36s)]
*  So I told henry if you want to work out some wrestling like [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=1088.3999999999999s)]

*  He probably wouldn't like he's gonna find out he wouldn't like it. Yeah, he's not gonna like that [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=1212.16s)]

*  Yeah, I guess I don't really know what's going with that [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=1258.8s)]
*  He's just sitting there though, you know what I mean? [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=1262.64s)]
*  I have another technical ufc question. Is there a mental component going into this fight knowing you kind of got fucked up by a stand-up comedian? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=1264.72s)]
*  Well, I mean I don't I don't want to bring it up because you guys are both here [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=1272.88s)]

*  Exactly, you know what's gonna suck. What's that is if he hits it again? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=1295.36s)]
*  My shit goes numb again. Well, then i'll accept that first loss. What are you gonna do to stop that? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=1298.9599999999998s)]
*  Well, it hasn't happened again [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=1304.08s)]
*  Do you do anything differently or it's just you don't think it's gonna happen again, right? It was so lucky [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=1306.8799999999999s)]

*  Okay, so it's not gay for me. Thank you. Appreciate that [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=1998.8s)]
*  half [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=2001.76s)]
*  Meeting him in the middle is half. Come on. How many times did he try until you finally you're more like the receiver when you think about [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=2004.24s)]
*  This is a great question. If it was less than three son [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=2010.0s)]
*  He went from the middle of the couch to the end of the couch it was exactly thrice [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=2013.28s)]
*  He tried twice and then he got it under the third time [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=2018.24s)]
*  I just accepted I said hey your feet cold. He said yeah, they're pretty chilly. Do you think he's cute? [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=2021.28s)]

*  He's a soccer guy. Yeah, he's cute though and I don't warm him up. I don't think that's that gay though [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=2031.84s)]
*  And it's not that gay. It's definitely gay but grappling in your underwear. I feel like he's gayer [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=2036.88s)]
*  Right if you're wearing under yo, that was a good point. That was a good point [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=2042.0s)]
*  I would never do that with my boys. I personally [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=2046.48s)]

*  Yeah, that's enough. I think you're just a lot of betas if two alphas are going out [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=2059.12s)]
*  It seems to kill each other. I think it's pretty fucking well [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=2063.12s)]
*  I think killing has to be part of the equation if they live that's pretty gay [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=2065.28s)]
*  You can kill him then you decide not to because you're that because you want to fuck him do it again [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=2069.04s)]
*  Yeah, but when you're practicing is just like that is kind of gay. I need it. It's like catch and release with the fish [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=2073.28s)]
*  That's what you're releasing. That's what jujitsu is is catching releasing. It's fucked up especially when you're fucking fish's mouth. Yeah [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=2079.84s)]

*  I have a question and we could cut it if you don't like it [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=3905.88s)]
*  But have you heard the conspiracy that the ufc is rigging fights for people like you and patty [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=3908.3599999999997s)]
*  They need more faces of the we definitely don't have to cut it. I mean i'm living it right now [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=3914.2s)]
*  So if someone's rigging it [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=3918.12s)]
*  I mean, I guess [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=3920.4399999999996s)]
*  Like so what who would be the one to rig it? Wait, what's the what's the conspiracy? [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=3922.2799999999997s)]
*  So it's like they don't have enough faces of the organization. So it's like they're trying to prop [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=3926.4399999999996s)]
*  Um [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=3931.64s)]
*  They're really not a cell fight so is the argument that they would have paid al joe to [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=3933.96s)]
*  I don't know. I just saw the conspiracy online [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=3939.0s)]
*  I feel like you see that [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=3941.48s)]
*  I feel like that's always kind of been a thing every once in a while when something happens [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=3942.52s)]
*  They're like, oh that's crazy. But the you the thing you're right about ufc needing stars right now [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=3945.7200000000003s)]
*  That's why I feel like i'm in such a fucking good position because I do feel like [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=3949.32s)]
*  I mean who you could argue there. I'm not the number one guy right now [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=3954.12s)]
*  But I think once this next fight happens plays out I win I will be the biggest [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=3957.88s)]
*  Guy in the ufc and by the end of the year i'll be the biggest [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=3962.28s)]
*  Athlete in sports by the end of 2024, but I do think I I definitely don't think the ufc's rigged [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=3965.72s)]
*  I don't understand how that would be. Um [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=3970.84s)]
*  but [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=3973.8s)]
*  They need stars and i'm right fucking there [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=3974.92s)]
*  All right guys, we're gonna take a break real quick because you see what's in my hand right now [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=3976.76s)]
*  This that freeze pipe for the smoothest way to enjoy canibis [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=3980.28s)]
*  You got to try a freezeable piece from freeze pipe if you're tired of inhaling harsh smoke [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=3984.38s)]
*  I got asthma so that hurts my chest coughing attacks all the little [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=3989.1s)]
*  Tiny baby rips you got to take because you don't want to hurt yourself. That's what I do [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=3993.58s)]
*  It's time for this bad boy right here [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=3997.02s)]
*  Every freeze pipe comes equipped with a freezeable glycerin chamber that cools smoke by over 300 degrees [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=3999.2599999999998s)]
*  That's damn near a juvenile album [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4006.06s)]
*  Simply pop the glycerin chamber in the freezer for one hour [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4008.78s)]

*  So they just just fucking drape you with love. Yeah, you and you look at your mom [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4251.28s)]

*  I'll go out there. I'll know what time like when she gets tired [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4281.74s)]
*  Like if she's not tired, she's not gonna take a nap [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4283.86s)]
*  But when she gets tired, we'll go out there and swing back and forth and she'll take a nap like 30 minutes on my chest [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4285.74s)]
*  It's like knocked out. Yeah, that's the best shit [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4291.9s)]
*  That tops everything that's like very peaceful [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4295.9s)]
*  That's the best. Yeah, did she surprise you like when she knows something or says something you're like, where the hell did you learn? [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4299.139999999999s)]
*  She said what the heck the other day that was funny [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4304.7s)]
*  So repeat things that you've said. Oh, yeah Danny Danny said she said something [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4307.82s)]
*  She said she said she said something today. I forget what it was [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4312.58s)]

*  Yeah, and it makes sense why you're not streaming as much like what you're just saying [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4336.54s)]
*  Because if you're basically like, okay, I'm gonna stream for three hours make I'm gonna go on this swing and just swing [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4339.78s)]

*  She'll run around or watch like she can go sit back in the back and watch Coco melon or something [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4350.9400000000005s)]

*  Yeah, you know just take her with me sit in the car get in her little car seat and hang out with her [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4358.06s)]
*  Yeah, and they learn everything from absorbing it. It's just watching [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4362.78s)]
*  I always say that like I don't think my parents told me much but I observed them [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4366.38s)]
*  No, but like it's one of those things where I was like wow, yeah, they didn't really discipline [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4375.06s)]
*  They didn't tell me how to be a person. I just kind of watch them [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4380.14s)]
*  So anything you tell them it just goes one near the other they're just gonna see how you treat Danny [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4382.74s)]

*  So she'll do that as far as fighting boxing MMA. I mean if it's her passion [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4525.38s)]

*  But that's kind of like being a lot of the guys game plans kick my legs. I think he's just gonna [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4571.38s)]
*  Hope this cardio outlasts mine and just be durable and [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4579.620000000001s)]
*  And try to get a finish later in the fight probably will be his game plan what's the most exhausted you've been in the fight [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4584.26s)]
*  Peter [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4590.58s)]
*  Either Peter or my UFC debut [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4592.66s)]
*  My debut was crazy. Yeah, I was fucking bro. That's crazy [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4595.0599999999995s)]
*  You think it was just the fact of your first fight or the nerves maybe made you my time [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4599.54s)]
*  I think well I was I was eating a vegan diet at the time and I wasn't eating I [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4602.98s)]
*  Wasn't eating how I should have been for a UFC fighter. I should have I should have been [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4608.42s)]
*  Should have been eating more [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4613.86s)]
*  and [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4615.86s)]
*  It was my first fight that went through five minute rounds as a pro when all it went the distance [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4617.179999999999s)]
*  and I just you know, I [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4623.22s)]
*  Trained as hard as I could at the time but looking back say I could have done a lot more [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4626.22s)]
*  But that fight was crazy like the first round I thought it was that for my UFC debut [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4629.86s)]
*  It begins Terry on where is one of my favorite fights to go back and watch it was so entertaining [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4634.78s)]
*  I was hitting such sweet shit and the first round of peace and I'm doing something crazy second round completely [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4637.98s)]
*  gassed out just like was dead tired and then the third round I hit a second wind [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4642.98s)]
*  Came up back on and finished that fight that fight. I was though. That was one of my favorite fights though [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4648.82s)]
*  Yeah, how would it difference? I'm sorry good. What is a [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4653.66s)]
*  Just from just from you know doing a little boxing like sparring back in the day [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4658.5s)]
*  there is nothing more demoralizing and vulnerable than having no cardio and [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4663.379999999999s)]
*  Two more minutes left. Oh, yeah. What is that? Like in the professional fight the cardio is gone. You're exhausted [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4669.06s)]
*  Where is your brain going? [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4676.34s)]
*  um, I [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4678.9s)]
*  Feel like I've trained I feel like you prepare in those camps you get there in training you get that time [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4680.54s)]
*  So you're comfortable with the exhaustion. Yeah, you're comfortable having nothing left. Yeah, well, it's either you quit or you keep going and [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4687.9s)]
*  What do you go? Okay, I'm just defending right now. I'm just protecting well [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4694.820000000001s)]
*  Sometimes the best, you know best way to kind of get a break is be offensive kind of you know [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4698.42s)]
*  Hmm, but it's not like fear taking over anything like that. It's a comfortable state [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4703.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's tricky. It's like I [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4708.58s)]
*  mean, it's hard to think about how you're thinking because you're just in survival being yeah, you fight or flight and [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4712.06s)]
*  I've all I feel like I always knew I had the dog in me or some people [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4718.74s)]
*  You don't know if they do or not [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4723.74s)]
*  And I that was a big question for me go or for a lot of people going into that Peter Yon fight [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4725.26s)]
*  Oh you like does he have that dog when he gets when he gets in a bad position? [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4728.860000000001s)]
*  Is he gonna still fight which I thought I proved when I broke my foot in my second fight [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4732.3s)]
*  I snapped the top my flat a list Frank surgery. I was hopping on one foot [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4737.1s)]
*  I thought that was enough to prove that I had the dog in me, but I still wasn't very popular at the time [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4740.9800000000005s)]
*  So I don't think a lot of people saw that fight [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4745.34s)]
*  But that Peter Yon fight yeah, I gotta show that cuz he you know he rocked me hard in the second round [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4747.22s)]
*  That fight was a war [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4752.5s)]
*  I'm gonna prove it. How much does the camp change when you're adding two extra rounds like five versus three? [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4754.1s)]
*  Yeah, that was an interesting camp last camp especially cuz I was dealing with a rib injury [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4759.9800000000005s)]
*  So it was like I wasn't even able to do I thought I was gonna be able to do five fives [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4763.5s)]
*  In sparring in MMA. I did five fives just kickboxing [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4769.1s)]
*  I was able to kickbox, but I wasn't able to do any MMA for the like last six weeks, so I didn't actually [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4773.3s)]
*  Go in I didn't do the five fives [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4778.9800000000005s)]
*  But I would add extra rounds hitting mitts or extra sprints than I would have if it was a three-round fight [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4781.74s)]
*  So it was just more more work. Mm-hmm. That's how bad does the injury have to be to call it off I? [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4787.820000000001s)]
*  Assume every half injured in every training camp yeah [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4793.900000000001s)]
*  If I wasn't if I if I wasn't the main event and that fight wasn't that was Boston that fight was meant for me [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4797.58s)]
*  That fight was the sugar show [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4803.679999999999s)]
*  So if it wasn't that I might I probably would have pulled out I couldn't grapple at all for six weeks [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4806.0199999999995s)]
*  And you're going up against a clinch whose competitive advantage against you should strongest guy grappling division [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4811.42s)]
*  Well, I know I hate bringing that up because it looks like I don't know it just sounds douchey [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4817.259999999999s)]
*  but it was just that was the reality of it I couldn't grapple and [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4821.94s)]
*  It was yeah, so I broke your rib not a break my rib is just like a muscle strain in there [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4825.62s)]
*  Yeah, so it's like you literally have you ever hurt your ribs. Yeah, it's tough [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4830.58s)]
*  My muscular you can't move at all you can't breathe with that pain. It is horrible [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4835.379999999999s)]
*  I couldn't I could hit me it's like a kickbox. I just couldn't do any kind of clinch any touching [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4839.62s)]
*  so I probably would have pulled out if it wasn't the main event and [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4844.74s)]
*  Is it nervous in the locker room going into a fight really calm [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4848.9s)]
*  That's why I'm so excited that documentary to come out [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4853.339999999999s)]
*  Because they were in the back the whole time with me are you ever surprised at how calm you are you were like [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4855.7s)]
*  Oh, I should feel more nervous when I'm actually locked in right now [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4859.42s)]
*  No, I'm just call. I just think I just know that's where I need to be mentally. Yeah, you perform my eyes love [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4862.66s)]
*  I heard you say you'll get like a meditative state during a fight, and you don't exactly know what's going on [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4868.299999999999s)]
*  Can you just walk us through? [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4873.36s)]
*  Exactly what that is because that sounds so fucking cool, but it's also kind of vague the way you say it [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4875.18s)]
*  Can you just give us? [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4880.38s)]
*  What's yeah? Yeah, so fight day with it. This was a weird fight day too cuz I didn't even fight Saturday [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4881.66s)]
*  I wait in Friday morning didn't even fight Saturday. I fought Sunday morning [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4887.18s)]
*  So that whole day Saturday is just fucking waiting around chilling, but I'm just very in tune with my breath the whole time [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4890.3s)]
*  So when you're constantly just following your breath your your heart rates lower. You're just kind of at a calm state [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4895.860000000001s)]
*  So all day, I've just kind of you know following my breath very calm all day like not exerting any energy [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4901.5199999999995s)]
*  Other than like a little workout blow up my lungs, but they're very calm so in the back same thing [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4908.36s)]
*  Just following my breath listen to the calming music until you know about 20 minutes before the fight [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4913.44s)]
*  And then you kind of turn up the music, but still very calm [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4918.94s)]
*  It just comes all comes out just following your breath like constantly. I'm just trying to follow my play with my breath like I'll do long [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4922.36s)]
*  Ass-holds I'll play I'll do like fire breathing with a long exhale [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4928.5s)]
*  I'll just do I'll play with it's like a game. You can just get this relationship with your breath play with it [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4936.900000000001s)]
*  It's just like Wim Hof. It kind of yeah, there's Wim Haw. It's just yeah, I mean it was just breathing is playing with it [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4941.22s)]
*  Well, I'll do long holds really really just get oxygen to all my muscles my entire body open up my lungs get my lungs prepared [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4948.06s)]
*  to you know be tired and have to [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4954.900000000001s)]
*  Just be able to move that oxygen, but uh yeah walking out to the fight I [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4958.54s)]
*  Always have that conversation with myself from my heart [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4964.66s)]
*  I'm just gonna let my let my higher self take over let all the work that I've put in take over whatever happens happens [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4966.82s)]
*  Mm-hmm truly go into that fight if I lose I [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4972.34s)]
*  Lose that's cool. It's like I'm not [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4976.22s)]
*  My life's not over. I've heard Connor talk about that like his perspective walking into the ring [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4978.5s)]
*  He's like okay. I put in all this time in this camp [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4983.12s)]
*  I work so hard non-stop training thinking about the opponent going to kill him and the second I walk in have fun [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4985.18s)]
*  I'm sparring. Yeah, I'm just gonna let loose. I'm gonna stop thinking about all these technical little details [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4990.66s)]
*  I prepared for myself and just exist. Yeah, what's going on? Sorry? What's going on in your brain? [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4995.6s)]
*  Is it just a reaction like move left duck what swing here? Yeah, I would say [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=4999.62s)]
*  There's very few thoughts going yeah going on and on in my mind [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5005.66s)]
*  It's probably what like those monks and the Buddhists like get to and they're enlightened [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5010.82s)]
*  Yeah, or they're just kind of they're feeling the wind or listening to sounds like I feel like it's a lot of that [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5015.16s)]
*  I don't really have very many [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5020.38s)]
*  Vivid memories of what actually like how'd you feel when you hit it like flow state? [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5022.9s)]
*  Yeah, and you can see it when you're starting to get off yeah, then it feels like everything is [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5029.0199999999995s)]
*  You know leading into another like every strike is connected to another one. It's not this like oh, here's a potch [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5034.54s)]
*  Let me hold my breath and wait each thing is connected to another thing [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5040.82s)]
*  Yeah, you've seen that with Connor too early in his fights like he would there's this like wheel kick that he would bust out every [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5044.62s)]
*  Once in a while, but the wheel kick came off of changing the direction of the opponent. Yeah, you know and it was just like [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5049.94s)]
*  Oh, wow, this is everything is a piece by piece setup. It's almost like chess match [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5055.46s)]
*  Well, you guys pre feel when you're performing on stage [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5059.9s)]
*  It's the same thing just in a different art form. Yeah, I really think it is like my feeling my worst sense [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5062.42s)]
*  I'm thinking about every little joke that I'm gonna do and the best sets is like just flowing crowd work thing here this joke here [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5068.3s)]
*  Move this joke. That's why I like crowd work because I can't think as much [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5074.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, and whereas sometimes you I don't know if this happens probably can't happen because it's life or death for you [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5078.7s)]
*  But like there's times where I feel like I'm watching myself kind of on autopilot [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5083.38s)]
*  The words are my that's what I'm the most mad at myself. I try to get into that and I did it just to core [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5086.78s)]
*  That's where I feel like the breath comes in. Yeah, that's why I feel like I show up every time [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5091.820000000001s)]
*  I know how to get into that flow state right through the work thing that you did [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5095.56s)]
*  This is like it's a different breath for a thing breath or thing [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5100.240000000001s)]
*  It's like your body has the trauma and then you breathe in it's like I mean, it's all the same really [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5103.68s)]
*  I feel like breath work. Yeah good for you. But as far as sparring goes like I definitely I don't think of fights is like [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5108.18s)]
*  Oh, it's just nice day sparring because in sparring. I'm not trying to kill this guy [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5114.34s)]
*  I don't I don't really want to hurt my partner. I really don't genuinely don't want to knock him out [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5117.34s)]
*  But in the cage I want I want to put his lights out. Yeah bad. Maybe I misquoted Conrad [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5122.76s)]
*  No, no, you're good. It's a lot of people do refer to it's like it's like sparring some people spar like that [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5128.240000000001s)]
*  I think they do that also to not make it too big. Yeah. Yeah. What do you want it big as I want it life or death? [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5133.080000000001s)]
*  I want to feel like I want that. Yeah, what do you think of that? [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5138.200000000001s)]
*  In gone with fury fight. I [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5141.8s)]
*  Thought Tyson won the boxing match. That's why I know he got dropped. He lost that round 10-8 [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5144.68s)]
*  I know he got pieced up in there later on but it's just I thought he he did enough that he out boxed him [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5149.68s)]
*  Yeah, and then [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5154.96s)]
*  But it was very impressive. I mean France crazy boxing IQ was so impressive. It was good even landing that hook [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5156.96s)]
*  Well, yeah, but he caught the one too. Like Tyson comes in with that one, too [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5163.72s)]
*  Yeah, every single that's his movie is these great faints. Oh, he was looking sharp in the beginning [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5167.8s)]
*  I was not at the very beginning of the fight. We landed like a big all it's like this like almost overhand, right? [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5172.04s)]
*  Little bit too much [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5177.84s)]
*  He just stood there. That is a Tyson looked at him like whoa, bro. That was scary [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5179.4800000000005s)]
*  I didn't realize he was 37 that is wild to [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5184.96s)]
*  Francis yeah, I've heard that on the [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5188.64s)]
*  Fuck 30 more MMA guys can I don't have so I do I think there is crazy levels to boxing [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5192.360000000001s)]
*  Hey guys, you know, there's one thing sugar Sean and I have in common only one probably on the entire planet [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5198.96s)]
*  And that's it. We both fucked with fucks with prize picks and if you use the promo code [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5204.2s)]
*  Schultz at sign up at price picks they'll match your initial deposit up to $100 [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5209.5199999999995s)]
*  That means if you put in a hundred you a hundred dollars for free [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5213.8s)]
*  You're already winning and if you're listening to the Akash locks, you might be winning you might also be losing [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5215.8s)]
*  Here's what I say though this week. You've got to go Patrick Mahomes. They're playing the Eagles [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5220.16s)]
*  I'm not sure the Chiefs will win, but I think [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5224.4s)]
*  He's gonna tear up that Eagle secondary. So you got to trust Patrick Mahomes with more also [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5227.2s)]
*  I'm gonna go Josh Allen less the Jets defense is still really good [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5232.04s)]
*  You just got to trust the Jets defense and if Kenny Pickett is offered less [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5235.6s)]
*  He's playing the Browns and he's Kenny Pickett and the Steelers keep winning games, but it's not because of him [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5241.2s)]
*  It's in spite of him. Those are the Akash locks go make some money price picks.com [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5246.18s)]
*  Promo code Schultz. Let's get back to the show. What did you think about the Sean Strickland? [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5251.4400000000005s)]
*  Is he fight that was crazy? I was not expecting that Sean Strickland proved [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5256.64s)]
*  You know a lot of people wrong me. I thought he was gonna piece him up [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5261.88s)]
*  I thought was a perfect fight for Izzy. I think a lot of us thought that but is his boxing style just really underrated. I [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5264.4800000000005s)]
*  Think so too. I think it was a mixture between I think you know that fight plays out different [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5271.2s)]
*  Obviously if they fight again, it's every time it's gonna be different. I don't I think [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5276.24s)]
*  Yeah, Sean showed up is maybe a combination of both. Maybe is he didn't take him as seriously but also [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5280.8s)]
*  Sean's boxing ackerman was higher than people thought. Yeah, I'm [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5286.68s)]
*  I don't know. I thought it was a very interesting fight. I would like to see Sean box some boxers. I'd be crazy [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5292.04s)]
*  It'd be really interesting. I wish we I wish it wasn't such a big deal [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5297.12s)]
*  I wish you could go box a little bit and [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5300.32s)]
*  It wasn't it didn't have to be a big deal. You don't think that they would let you do that [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5302.64s)]
*  I think I'm I will do that since you want Hank, right? Oh, yeah, I still want that fight [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5305.68s)]
*  I'm gonna I'll get that fight someday. You want tank. Yeah genuinely. Yeah, I'm gonna get that fight somebody [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5309.72s)]
*  I really really the same way I would have sat here and told you I'm probably did [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5315.360000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna be champ like the same feeling I have is like I'm gonna I don't know if it's gonna be tank [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5318.86s)]
*  I don't know Ryan Garcia could be so I think [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5323.259999999999s)]
*  That I will have a big boxing but you also look at tank and you're like this guy's an exceptional boxer [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5325.58s)]
*  Yeah, of course and like like a bud Crawford, for example [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5330.58s)]
*  Exceptional. Yeah. Yeah, you just said how skill [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5334.78s)]
*  Yeah, and then you said it's not to take away from your skill [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5338.5s)]
*  But it's you can acknowledge that these guys are absolutely devastatingly good at boxing. Yeah, okay [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5341.62s)]
*  And I could still win. Yeah, I'm not saying you could yeah, but you acknowledge that [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5347.84s)]
*  It's not a walk in the park like it might be no shot. Yeah, of course not [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5352.0s)]
*  I don't think it's got me. I'm gonna but I say I could I could you could also clip them and then drop [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5355.32s)]
*  That's the game. I that's the game. I I'm a fucking sniper [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5360.400000000001s)]
*  So know how to punch so this is what I would say and a your way [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5364.24s)]
*  We'll ask so tall if people asked before this Francis and Gano [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5367.16s)]
*  Tyson fury fight if people ask who's a better striker pound for pound [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5371.32s)]
*  Sean O'Malley or Francis and Gano I [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5376.68s)]
*  think [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5380.4800000000005s)]
*  Nine out of ten people would say Sean O'Malley and they'd be right and and they would probably be right technically after this fight [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5381.4800000000005s)]
*  after shaker a boxer just [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5389.360000000001s)]
*  Boxer just box. Okay, just boxer even boxer. I think not a telling day. Oh, yeah, his hands are crazy [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5392.24s)]
*  After this fight, I think a lot of people go I think we underestimated Francis boxing [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5397.52s)]
*  Take away from you, but I never thought Francis was this high IQ with the boxing the decisions he was making [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5402.08s)]
*  Yeah [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5407.76s)]
*  I thought he was gonna be like a lot of the MMA guys that go into boxing that they have two or three strikes [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5408.24s)]
*  And then they freeze [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5413.04s)]
*  Francis was at moments of this fight in control of who I think is the best heavyweight boxer of all time [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5414.84s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's different a heavyweight too because one punch just not that I don't have one punch [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5421.08s)]
*  But my one punch has to be right on the chin [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5427.4s)]
*  I have you can hit him with either hand you get up two hands and boxing and he could throw and just land and drop [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5429.4s)]
*  So it not to take away from how impressive it was. Yeah, but I just think a heavyweight is different [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5436.0s)]
*  Yeah, and the interest in it was crazy [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5441.759999999999s)]
*  I mean the UFC's got to look at that and be salivating and go okay if tank agrees to a fight against our champ [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5443.32s)]
*  We'll see the UFC they said, you know, they're like, yeah, we'll see if they they they're half the big [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5450.96s)]
*  They don't they don't look at him as a star right now. Wait, wait, they don't think tank is a star. Yeah [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5457.4s)]
*  what [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5463.28s)]
*  What? [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5465.28s)]
*  They said Ryan Garcia was a star is a star they said Ryan Garcia carried that I [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5468.48s)]
*  I'll be honest if you look at the tanks this is what they said, of course [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5474.12s)]
*  But if you look at tanks past few fights, if you just look at the gate [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5477.679999999999s)]
*  Whoever tank fights it sold tank has the hood like there's certain boxers that that have [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5480.48s)]
*  Different cultures. Yeah Oscar had Mexicans Latinos. He also had women that was another thing back in a day [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5487.5599999999995s)]
*  Floyd had everybody you either want him to lose you want to win, but you also have black Americans [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5493.5599999999995s)]
*  They're like, you know, this guy's gonna win. We're riding with this guy tank has black Americans. I think he's getting there [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5498.639999999999s)]
*  I don't know. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm telling you bro. He's been there for four fights [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5503.08s)]
*  But what I'll say is when you go watch a UFC fight, there is so much more value on that card than watching a box [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5506.679999999999s)]
*  That's what I wanted to say like when I go watch [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5512.5199999999995s)]
*  If I watch you headline right not only do I get to watch you I might pay for you [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5514.96s)]
*  Yeah, but I'm gonna get at least a couple bangers three or four other fights that I'm interested in. Yeah, even a casual [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5519.16s)]
*  I'm a super casual. I will know both fighters and at least two fights on every UFC card. Yeah boxing [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5526.719999999999s)]
*  I will know one box. Have you been in whoever he's lifting? [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5532.5599999999995s)]
*  Jake Paul, it's he actually have you been to a boxing man? [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5536.879999999999s)]
*  Jake's box it if [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5541.280000000001s)]
*  If you go to if you go to a boxing match, it is an empty arena until the minute they walk into the ring [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5543.68s)]
*  Yeah, if you go to UFC fight, it is absolutely packed from beginning to the prelims. Yeah [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5550.68s)]
*  It's a better product. Yeah, but the money doesn't lie [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5556.92s)]
*  Because what they're doing is to go out of business sale in boxing. They're doing business poorly [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5560.8s)]
*  Yeah, it benefits the top of the top [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5564.88s)]
*  But it kills the brand of box [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5567.16s)]
*  Yeah [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5569.04s)]
*  and then with UFC they're able to build a brand and the cost of building that brand is [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5569.28s)]
*  reinvesting into the business that builds it [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5576.52s)]
*  Yeah, and I know that's frustrating for you guys and I want you guys to make all the fucking money [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5578.32s)]
*  Don't get me wrong and I hope it at the top you guys make all the money [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5581.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, but the way that you [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5584.24s)]
*  Basically move past boxing is by doing exactly what you guys did. It's what Amazon did Amazon didn't make any profit [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5586.84s)]
*  They just dump everything back into the business back into the business [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5593.4s)]
*  So the fact that UFC has gone from this like weird like hairy Billy fringe sport [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5596.48s)]
*  Yeah, where you're seeing like fat dudes fight sumo wrestlers to the number one [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5602.92s)]
*  Who's the guy I'm thinking of the big fat black karate guy [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5610.48s)]
*  Yeah, I fought hoist Gracie back in the day or whatever. Anyway, like to the number one fight sport. It takes reinvestment [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5613.78s)]

*  Yeah, I think that's something that's kind of missed and people middle class here none [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5629.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, but the main event in boxing they make crazy money main event. Yeah, but boxing as a whole sucks [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5633.6s)]

*  That's kind of what I fuck with with the UFC is is like if they really wanted to protect you they wouldn't feed Judy [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5798.36s)]
*  Yawn putting you up against yawn is like, let's see if this kid got it [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5804.32s)]

*  I mean, I don't I guess I don't know who else you give him why there's just not much upside [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5845.860000000001s)]
*  I mean you beat I don't know. I guess if you go out there and he does beat Tony Tony [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-YXd1N6NLA&t=5849.6s)]
