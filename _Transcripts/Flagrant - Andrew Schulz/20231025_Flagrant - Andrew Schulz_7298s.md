# Israel & Palestine Conflict, UFC 294 Reaction, & Schulz Tour Recap
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [October 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o)
*  This is Arabic tobacco. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=0.0s)]
*  You ever tried this before? [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1.76s)]
*  I could barely hit a vape pen without vomiting. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  It's legal, you can buy this at a gas station. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4.48s)]
*  Gas station drugs are the best. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6.32s)]
*  All right, you hit it. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=8.64s)]
*  No, you got to hit it first. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=9.36s)]
*  It's no fun if I hit it first, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=10.24s)]
*  because then you know what you're going to feel. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=11.6s)]
*  Out of here. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=12.88s)]
*  How many bite people got set up with that one before? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=13.52s)]
*  No big deal. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=19.84s)]
*  God damn it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=28.0s)]
*  Are you going to hit? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=30.0s)]
*  No, I'm not going to hit it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=30.8s)]
*  Come on, just take one little hit on the Medouac. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=37.76s)]
*  Oh, all right. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=44.16s)]
*  What's up, everybody? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=49.68s)]
*  Welcome to Flavorant. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=50.72s)]
*  We just got back from Abu Dhabi. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=51.6s)]
*  For some reason, Tonya and Dov are still there. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=56.0s)]
*  We're still figuring out what the issue with that is. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=59.76s)]
*  We're doing our best to get them back over. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  They had some more questions for them while they were there. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=64.88s)]
*  What do you think that was? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=66.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=68.32s)]
*  We had to start a podcast. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=68.72s)]
*  We are already probably a day late on this. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=69.84s)]
*  Apologies. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=73.2s)]
*  But we're here, and we're in touch with the embassies and everything, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  and we're going to hope that they'll be back. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=77.92s)]
*  So in the meantime, if you have any questions about Israel, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=80.8s)]
*  Palestine, now is the time to ask, and we'll get to the bottom of it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=82.8s)]
*  No, no. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=86.24s)]
*  We're out in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=86.64s)]
*  That's the last destination. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=89.36s)]
*  Obviously, we did the European tour as well, and it was awesome, man. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=90.56s)]
*  It was really... [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=94.24s)]
*  The show in Abu Dhabi was insane. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=94.96s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=99.92s)]
*  It was insane, and I didn't edit anything. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=100.56s)]
*  That's what I wanted to ask. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=103.28s)]
*  How were they about flagrancy? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=104.32s)]
*  Oh, they were loving it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=106.64s)]
*  There was one joke that I was concerned about, and I don't want to say it, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=108.24s)]
*  but I'm sure if anybody's seen the Life Tour, they're probably aware of it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=114.4s)]
*  There was one joke, and in the moment, I was like, I don't know. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=118.56s)]
*  I was like, fuck it, I'll just do it, and they fucking exploded. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=126.64s)]
*  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  Not like that. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=127.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, good point. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=128.56s)]
*  They exploded. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  There's no more anti-itabrit. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=131.36s)]
*  Be more sensitive, dude. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=132.16s)]
*  Come on. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=133.36s)]
*  No, no, it was crazy, and the Emirates is just... [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  It's really interesting. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  Everybody there, all the locals, they went to school in America somewhere, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=138.88s)]
*  or they went to school in England. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=142.8s)]
*  So they're fluent. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=144.24s)]
*  English is perfect, and they are aware of all the cultural stuff. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  They've experienced the cultural stuff. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=149.6s)]
*  So that was probably our most fluent American audience. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=151.12s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=156.0s)]
*  In American culture. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=157.12s)]
*  In American culture. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=158.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=159.28s)]
*  London as well, but I was shocked, because I think we all went into it going, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=160.16s)]
*  I don't know what they're going to find funny. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  I don't know what's going on. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  You also have the guys in the robes, the condor, as they're called. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=166.48s)]
*  So you're thinking, okay, are they going to get all these things? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=169.2s)]
*  But all those dudes went to school in America, and they didn't go to school in New York. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=171.6s)]
*  They went to school in Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=176.32s)]
*  So they're really aware of it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=180.88s)]
*  It was fun. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=184.24s)]
*  I didn't edit anything. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  Fire. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=186.32s)]
*  It was really cool. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=186.88s)]
*  I'll get hit up sometimes, be like, hey, you got to come to Dubai to do a show. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=188.64s)]
*  And I'm like, no, that seems crazy. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=191.6s)]
*  What would I do? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  That seems dangerous. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=194.0s)]
*  And they will always say, no, you don't get it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=195.2s)]
*  They were way more down than you think. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=196.88s)]
*  It's cool to know. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=198.32s)]
*  Yeah, it was fire. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=199.12s)]
*  I think way more down. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=200.0s)]
*  Because they don't get it necessarily. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=201.28s)]
*  They don't get that type of thing. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=202.96s)]
*  Not that many people go there. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=204.0s)]
*  And the people that do go there, I think, go in with this conception. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=204.96s)]
*  They're terrified. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=207.12s)]
*  This is a very conservative Muslim country. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=207.84s)]
*  You can't do the certain things you would normally do. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=210.16s)]
*  And so I think people probably button it up. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=212.56s)]
*  Whereas they're like, yo, we- [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=214.72s)]
*  And they also tell you, there's five different versions of what you can or can't say. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=220.96s)]
*  The promoters are saying one thing, but the promoters might be from outside of the Emirates. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=221.76s)]
*  So they're worried about their reputation. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=226.72s)]
*  So they're like, don't touch about these things. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=228.16s)]
*  And then you talk to the people there on that side. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=229.6s)]
*  They're like, yeah, yeah, kind of say whatever you want. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=231.51999999999998s)]
*  They're like, listen, don't trash Islam. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=234.16s)]
*  That's not a good idea. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=235.84s)]
*  But have jokes, do whatever. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=236.96s)]
*  But the audience is like, I mean, like women hijabis. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  Women in the hijab just fucking die laughing and playing with jokes. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=242.16s)]
*  So it was very cool. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=245.28s)]
*  People are people, bro. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=246.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=247.76s)]
*  People are people. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=248.48s)]
*  They just like jokes. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=249.04s)]
*  It was funny, but it's just funny. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=249.92s)]
*  Yeah, to what you said, I do think there's a thing where the more constrictive a culture is, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=250.88s)]
*  the more the comedy club is the haven. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=256.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=258.64s)]
*  Everybody can come laugh. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=258.88s)]
*  It's different, but we talk about Portland. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=260.0s)]
*  And you'll say the audiences love the offensive jokes because outside, none of that is allowed. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=261.92s)]
*  So we go to this place where now, oh, I can finally hear it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=267.04s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=270.0s)]
*  I'm dying. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=270.48s)]
*  Especially if it's with love. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=272.8s)]
*  You did a good job, though. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=272.96s)]
*  You didn't go up and just be like, hey, here are my jokes. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=273.92s)]
*  The first 15 minutes, he's talking about deep cut, I'm sure you're gonna put clips out from it, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=276.96s)]
*  right? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=281.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=281.52s)]
*  But you talk about deep cut things that you only know if you grew up in Abu Dhabi. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=281.76s)]
*  Like even people from Dubai were like, wait, it's so nuanced, it's so niche. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=286.8s)]
*  There's a guy sitting in front of us at the show while we were watching. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=290.88s)]
*  And the whole time, he's just like, how does he know this? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=293.44s)]
*  He's touching the people next to him, he's like, how did he figure this out? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=296.32s)]
*  Speaking in Arabic words that they were like, this is insane. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=301.28s)]
*  So you did a good job of being inserted into the culture. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=303.76s)]
*  And I think if they see that, then they know that you're not coming there just judging them [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=306.24s)]
*  and basically criticizing all their shit that's different from yours. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=310.48s)]
*  They're like, okay, you took a little second to absorb what's going on. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=313.76s)]
*  And then I think they give you the longest leash, they're the most open about anything [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=316.8s)]
*  else you say, because you're not coming through with that critical lens. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=324.48s)]
*  Yeah, right, right, right. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=327.36s)]
*  The intention is good, he took the time to learn about us. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=328.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it was fun, so I'll put some clips out for it, but there was some fun shit. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=330.0s)]
*  It was fire, bro. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=335.76s)]
*  Our hotel in Abu Dhabi was literally in the middle of the F1 track. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=336.56s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=340.8s)]
*  The hotel was built and there was my bathroom where I would take a shit, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=341.76s)]
*  I look out the window and that's where the F1 car and everything goes. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=346.4s)]
*  And we got on the fucking F1 track. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=349.68s)]
*  Yeah, that was fire. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=350.8s)]
*  That was crazy. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=351.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=352.32s)]
*  Side of roosters, you just hear, and I wake you up. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=352.8s)]
*  You think it's awesome, you get to like, dude, we're on the track. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=356.8s)]
*  And then like 10 AM, it's just, yeah. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=358.88s)]
*  We could move the schedule a little bit. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=362.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=364.15999999999997s)]
*  But dude, it was so cool. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=364.48s)]
*  Are we gonna share some of the people that came to the show? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=365.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=368.24s)]
*  I don't know what the rule of that is, but before the show starts, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=369.36s)]
*  there's one of the promoters that's there. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=371.36s)]
*  And I'm going through all my jokes being like, is any of this funny? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=372.64s)]
*  Is any of this gonna work? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=375.12s)]
*  Do they know what this means at all? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=376.08000000000004s)]
*  I'm like so stressed. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=377.76s)]
*  I'm only doing like 12, 15 minutes, but I'm just like so, so anxious. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=378.64s)]
*  And I talked to the promoter and she looked super nervous. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=381.6s)]
*  And I'm like, wait, what's going on? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=383.84000000000003s)]
*  And she's like, well, one of the members of the royal family [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=386.08000000000004s)]
*  that's a little bit higher up in the family than we anticipated. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=390.40000000000003s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=393.52000000000004s)]
*  Showed up tonight. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=394.0s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=394.8s)]
*  And we didn't anticipate them to be here. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=395.12s)]
*  We expected some of the lower levels of the family to be here. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=396.64s)]
*  Did you know this? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=399.04s)]
*  No. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=399.76000000000005s)]
*  We didn't tell them. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=400.24s)]
*  No one told them because we were like, fuck, this is gonna be an issue. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=400.88s)]
*  And so they're like, yeah, one of the members of the royal family. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=403.04s)]
*  And again, United Arab Emirates is controlled by basically one royal family. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=405.28000000000003s)]
*  Every different emirate has a royal family. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=410.08000000000004s)]
*  Like kingdom. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=412.32000000000005s)]
*  Seven different tribes, they got organized by one guy. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=412.88s)]
*  And that guy was from Abu Dhabi. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=416.32000000000005s)]
*  Abu Dhabi is where all the real money is. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=418.16s)]
*  They have oil still, they have gas still. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=420.56s)]
*  Dubai doesn't have any oil or gas. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=422.40000000000003s)]
*  And their whole bet in Dubai was, yo, let's turn it into like a tourism hub [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=424.16s)]
*  because we're gonna run out of the oil and gas. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=427.28000000000003s)]
*  But originally these were all their individual tribes. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=428.88s)]
*  And they're organized by Zayed, what's his name? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=431.6s)]
*  Sheikh Zayed. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=434.96s)]
*  Sheikh Zayed. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=435.6s)]
*  And he convinced a bunch of these other tribes to lock in. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=436.96s)]
*  Now there's a few that didn't. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=440.56s)]
*  I don't think Oman decided not to. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=441.52s)]
*  They're like, we'll do our own thing. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=443.12s)]
*  It's like Stringer Bell for oil. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=443.84s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=445.6s)]
*  The wire. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=446.32s)]
*  Qatar and Bahrain. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=446.64s)]
*  Qatar, Bahrain, they decided not to, but then the other ones got down. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=447.52s)]
*  But so we're sitting there, I'm talking to the girl. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=450.32s)]
*  I'm like, okay, on level one being the biggest dude and 10 being a lower level person, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=451.84s)]
*  what would you rate it? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=455.84s)]
*  She was like, probably like three or four. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=456.4s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=458.8s)]
*  So we're like, okay. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=459.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=460.56s)]
*  And so we're going through the jokes. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=460.88000000000005s)]
*  He's going through jokes like, should I say this one? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=462.24s)]
*  Should I do this one? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=463.68s)]
*  And then no one says anything. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=464.48s)]
*  I don't know if it's gonna be expats or locals. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=465.04s)]
*  And by locals, that means you have to be born as an Emirati. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=467.44s)]
*  You're not born there. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=470.48s)]
*  Like you have to be part of the family. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=471.6s)]
*  An expat, people who move from the US too, right? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=472.64000000000004s)]
*  No. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=476.24s)]
*  The opposite. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=476.8s)]
*  So you have to be like from there. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=477.36s)]
*  You're a tribal from there. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=479.36s)]
*  And then an expat that moves there is not considered a local. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=480.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm saying. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=483.28000000000003s)]
*  And an expat is someone who comes from somewhere else. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=484.24s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=486.40000000000003s)]
*  So then we do the show. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=487.04s)]
*  The show's amazing. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=487.76000000000005s)]
*  Then afterwards, the promoter like kind of comes up to Dove and Andrew. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=488.40000000000003s)]
*  And they're like, members of the Royal Family would like to meet you. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=491.36s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=494.08000000000004s)]
*  What are you thinking in this moment? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=494.40000000000003s)]
*  Because you didn't even know they were there. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=495.52000000000004s)]
*  Anybody I see in the condorra, I assume is the Royal Family. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=496.64000000000004s)]
*  It's really amazing. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=500.88s)]
*  No, it's an amazing way that like when everybody puts on the outfit, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=502.56s)]
*  you just kind of assume. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=507.12s)]
*  So you don't know. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=508.8s)]
*  And the Royal doesn't get like a stick or anything to let you know that there's, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=509.52000000000004s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=513.84s)]
*  Like the crown or anything like that. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=514.4s)]
*  So it's actually kind of cool in that way where anybody you see is dressed the same. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=515.92s)]
*  So the flex happens in another way, not just the clothing, right? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=519.76s)]
*  Where like obviously, you know, in America or something else, like we're flexing, right? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=522.88s)]
*  They don't have a bunch of logos on there. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=527.52s)]
*  But you would think. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=529.12s)]
*  On their rolls and shit like that. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=529.8399999999999s)]
*  You would think. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=530.4799999999999s)]
*  Supreme condorra. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=530.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=531.76s)]
*  So I was giving royal treatment to some bums, probably. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=531.92s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=534.0799999999999s)]
*  I'm seeing the condorra. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=535.68s)]
*  I'm like, what's up, man? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=536.56s)]
*  How you doing? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=537.36s)]
*  And- [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=538.4799999999999s)]
*  Bro, it's nerve wracking. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=539.12s)]
*  Yeah, the rules are going to come back. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=540.3199999999999s)]
*  We're not allowed to say no to them if they want to meet you. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=541.4399999999999s)]
*  Like that's kind of the rule. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=543.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=544.64s)]
*  Imagine saying no. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=545.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'm good. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=547.0400000000001s)]
*  So they're coming back right now and yeah, they would like to speak with you. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=547.9200000000001s)]
*  And then the dude comes back and what happens? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=551.44s)]
*  I think, yeah, I think that. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=553.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think it was just, it was vibes. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=554.32s)]
*  It was fun. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=555.6800000000001s)]
*  The nicest guy. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=556.4s)]
*  He's like 20 year old dude, super sweet, huge fan of comedy, love Schultz, had the best time of the show. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=557.2s)]
*  Brought all his boys and we just had- [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=563.28s)]
*  It was just, yeah, it was fun. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=564.96s)]
*  And all of these things that I made up in my head of like, oh, they're going to be this and conservative. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=566.32s)]
*  They were just like- [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=570.4s)]
*  They're kids. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=570.8000000000001s)]
*  We just like jokes. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=571.6800000000001s)]
*  We just like hanging out with the boys. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=572.32s)]
*  They're just kids. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=573.84s)]
*  Yeah, it was crazy. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=574.96s)]
*  We went out to get some food. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=576.0s)]
*  They're like, hey, do you want to come back to our pals and play FIFA? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=576.96s)]
*  And we're like- [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=581.6800000000001s)]
*  This is Mark's dream, dude. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=582.24s)]
*  Bro, immediately. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=583.12s)]
*  Yeah, we would like to do that. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=583.52s)]
*  I started Instagraming. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=584.88s)]
*  A lot of fun. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=585.6s)]
*  I started Instagraming, dude. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=586.24s)]
*  We were talking shit. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=587.12s)]
*  I was like, dude, I'm going to watch you in FIFA. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=588.1600000000001s)]
*  If I beat you in FIFA, I get citizenship. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=589.52s)]
*  I'm going to sports watch you. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=590.8000000000001s)]
*  Bro, it was crazy. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=594.1600000000001s)]
*  It was so fun. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=594.88s)]
*  And then he had one of the most insane comebacks in FIFA history. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=595.52s)]
*  Oh yeah, I couldn't let them beat me, bro. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=598.24s)]
*  You can't do that, dude. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=599.9200000000001s)]
*  I mean, he beat me, but it was penalty kicks, bro. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=601.0400000000001s)]
*  It was penalty kicks. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=604.8s)]
*  When you were bragging about a loss here? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=606.0799999999999s)]
*  But it was a good comeback, though. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=607.76s)]
*  That's a Schultz win. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=609.68s)]
*  It is a Schultz win. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=613.28s)]
*  It is a Schultz win right there. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=613.92s)]
*  No, it was just fun. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=615.5999999999999s)]
*  It was cool learning little things about the spot. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=616.7199999999999s)]
*  I didn't understand the whole license plate shit. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=620.16s)]
*  Have you heard about this thing where license plates are incredibly expensive there? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=622.4799999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=625.5999999999999s)]
*  So the smaller the number, it's like- [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=626.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=628.3199999999999s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=628.64s)]
*  The higher they are or- [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=629.28s)]
*  Or it's just more expensive. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=630.48s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=631.8399999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=632.24s)]
*  And it's like if you buy, someone bought number three for like $10 million or something like that. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=632.5600000000001s)]
*  And I was like, yo, what's the deal with this? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=637.6s)]
*  Because I didn't understand it. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=639.04s)]
*  I was like, it seems like such a flagrant waste of money. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=640.16s)]
*  And one of the kids was like, yo, when everybody has a G-Wagon, it ain't a flex. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=643.04s)]
*  And people are going to find their ways to flex outside of just having a G-Wagon. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=648.72s)]
*  So it's the license plate number. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=652.5600000000001s)]
*  And then he was like, and now what's happening is if people don't want you to know who they are, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=654.8000000000001s)]
*  they buy a shitty number. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=660.64s)]
*  So if you've got real money, the way of kind of like making your identity a little bit more obscure [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=662.96s)]
*  is to not have the low number. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=667.84s)]
*  And is that its own flex? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=669.44s)]
*  Like people who buy designer clothes in America and they're like, I don't want the logo on it at all. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=670.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=674.08s)]
*  Whereas when you first get money, you're like, I want the logo everywhere. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=674.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=676.64s)]
*  I've got this. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=676.88s)]
*  And you gotta say, like, they're first getting money. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=677.44s)]
*  We're talking about like, they've been rich for 50 years. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=679.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=683.6s)]
*  They've only been in country for like 70. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=684.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=685.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=686.16s)]
*  So like they're still learning how to deal with money, what to spend it on, where you invest, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=686.72s)]
*  what kids are going to do with their life. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=691.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=694.16s)]
*  It was just a very interesting thing. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=694.48s)]
*  I had no expectation really going into it. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=695.92s)]
*  I was like, okay, it's just going to be big glitz, glamour, hotels are crazy, super flex, et cetera. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=699.36s)]
*  And then just getting into like the nuances of the culture I thought was kind of cool. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=704.88s)]
*  Can you explain that some people had a license plate more expensive than the car? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=708.4s)]
*  Like some people had a Nissan. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=712.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=713.6s)]
*  They told me that like back in the day, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=715.04s)]
*  that during the war, like they sided with Kuwait, I guess, against Iraq. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=717.84s)]
*  And the guy who had like the Nissan dealership rights in the country basically gave the army [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=723.92s)]
*  Nissans. So now Nissan is like a beloved brand there. So everybody gets these Nissans as a way [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=729.76s)]
*  to just show respect. But then you put the super high license plate on it. So you let people know, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=737.2s)]
*  like, yo, I don't have to have a Nissan. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=741.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=743.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? I got it. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=744.08s)]
*  And probably they were saying like dating is wild. Like you can't just take a girl to your house [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=745.36s)]
*  because obviously it's strict Muslim rules. Like your mom is going to tell their mom, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=750.16s)]
*  there's only a million Emiratis. So what they do is they'll like have their first dates and [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=754.8s)]
*  they'll fuck in like mall parking lots. So you basically get the SUV that can get folded back. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=760.4s)]
*  And then you go to a mall parking lot and that's your fucking date. And you can't go to the hotel [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=767.36s)]
*  because every hotel you got to show your ID and that will get back to mom and pops. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=770.9599999999999s)]
*  So they got to find all these workarounds for the system. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=774.8000000000001s)]
*  That's so funny. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=777.0400000000001s)]
*  They're not banging out Russian hookers and shit. Yeah. Yeah. No, it was cool. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=777.44s)]
*  Bro, it was awesome. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=781.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=782.32s)]
*  Shamakis, can you explain that? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=782.48s)]
*  I don't even know how to get into it. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=784.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, we'll put out all the clips and everything like that. But yeah, it was really [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=785.44s)]
*  cool. I'm excited for everybody to see it. But it was good that I think that was like our last stop. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=788.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=792.8000000000001s)]
*  It was so cool. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=793.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was really, it was really fun. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=793.76s)]
*  And it was an arena. Like we watched the UFC fight in the same place the night before. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=795.84s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=799.36s)]
*  That was dope too. UFC fight was crazy. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=800.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=802.4000000000001s)]
*  Did you guys watch that fight? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=802.96s)]
*  I did. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=803.84s)]
*  I saw the fight too. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=804.1600000000001s)]
*  Thoughts? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=805.0400000000001s)]
*  I mean, I've all took the fight on such short notice. I just hope he's doing okay. I love him. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=806.32s)]
*  It was obviously we hate to see him lose, but it was just like, fuck dude. I hate that he took [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=810.5600000000001s)]
*  that fight on such short notice. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=813.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And he was very transparent in the post fight interview. I don't know if you saw it. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=814.8000000000001s)]
*  No, I didn't see it. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=819.6800000000001s)]
*  But he was getting a little emotional. He was just like, hey man, you know, in between fights, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=820.08s)]
*  like I didn't have a fight and I was kind of doing my head in like, and he goes, and I know [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=823.84s)]
*  I shouldn't like I have a beautiful family and I have my lovely children and everything, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=826.8000000000001s)]
*  but it was still really hard for me. So I like to stay busy. But it was, I think he was like [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=830.4s)]
*  explaining something that a lot of athletes probably go through. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=834.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=837.28s)]
*  Which is, you know, dealing with the fact that you're not happy when you have everything you want. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=837.68s)]
*  You're recognized as one of the greatest to ever do it. You have a beautiful family, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=843.04s)]
*  a beautiful children, you have money and you're still kind of struggling. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=846.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=849.36s)]
*  And, and him taking the fight, I think that was like part of that. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=849.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=853.36s)]
*  I need this goal. I need something to work towards. I need to be in the game and having him like open [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=853.6s)]
*  up about that. It was like almost like tearing up. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=859.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=861.76s)]
*  Yeah. That's very cool. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=862.0799999999999s)]
*  But yeah, so it was a bummer to see him losing and Kamaru, I thought Kamaru beat, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=863.28s)]
*  I thought he won. I had a two one. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=868.48s)]
*  Really? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=870.56s)]
*  I didn't think he won, but I thought it was a great fight. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=871.28s)]
*  I thought either way. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=872.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=873.68s)]
*  Or even. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=873.92s)]
*  I had him winning the second round and then obviously Tremont winning the first round and [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=875.84s)]
*  the third round could have gone even. But like Kamaru was starting to get the better of him. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=879.6s)]
*  Yeah. I thought he'd gone five rounds. I again, I don't know much. I thought Kamaru lost the [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=883.84s)]
*  third round, but I think if it had gone five, he would have won. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=888.48s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, he was coming on. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=890.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=892.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=892.4s)]
*  I mean. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=892.88s)]
*  Watching it on TV, could you guys hear Andrew screaming? He don't want it from Tremont. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=893.12s)]
*  Tremont, Tremont's dad is like three rows behind me. The second this decision gets announced, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=899.2s)]
*  his dad is like laser beam eye or uncle or somebody goes in fucking Russian. I don't know [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=905.2s)]
*  what that is. And no smile, nothing. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=910.64s)]
*  Yeah, they don't fuck around. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=918.16s)]
*  Dead serious. Didn't say nothing during the fight though. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=919.04s)]
*  Because he was waiting. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=922.3199999999999s)]
*  Because he wasn't confident. But you know who won me over? Tremont won me over, bro. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=923.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=927.68s)]
*  Like afterwards. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=928.16s)]
*  Even the embrace they had afterwards was great. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=928.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=930.64s)]
*  Beautiful. I think he's one of those dudes where it's like he's a very nice, sweet, sensitive, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=931.04s)]
*  kind person that happens to be one of the most talented people on the planet at hand-to-hand [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=939.6s)]
*  combat murdering people. And like. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=945.76s)]
*  That whole culture is like. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=948.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=949.6s)]
*  Bro. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=949.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=950.0s)]
*  All of them. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=950.48s)]
*  Kind, thoughtful, sweet, nobody's an asshole. Nobody's, but they understand what they have to [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=951.12s)]
*  do to like sell the fights. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=955.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=956.88s)]
*  Which is kind of like antithetical to how they're raised. So they do it to sell the fights. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=957.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=961.2s)]
*  But outside of that, like. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=961.4399999999999s)]
*  Naturally humble. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=962.56s)]
*  Humble, chill. Yeah. Yeah, it was fucking, it was really cool. The energy was really cool. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=963.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=969.4399999999999s)]
*  Your twin was cool. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=969.68s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=970.56s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=971.6s)]
*  That's insane, dude. Bro, I go up to meet. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=972.16s)]
*  He knew. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=974.8s)]
*  I saw Zlatan, right? I go up to meet, you know Zlatan? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=975.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=977.8399999999999s)]
*  And remember we posted that clip about the Lebron James jersey. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=978.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=981.4399999999999s)]
*  Where Lebron sends him a jersey, he signs it back, sends it to him. I go up to me and I was like, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=981.6s)]
*  hey man, I just want to say hello. Like a big fan, really appreciate you. And he looks out to me, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=984.8s)]
*  he goes, you like that jersey thing, don't you? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=989.68s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=991.92s)]
*  Of course I saw it. And I was like, dude, I love it. He goes, yes, if he come to me with the jersey, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=995.4399999999999s)]
*  obviously I don't do this. I give him a jersey, we try, but to mail me a jersey, not to the person. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1000.16s)]
*  Who does he think he is? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1004.72s)]
*  That's so fire. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1005.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm Zlatan. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1009.52s)]
*  Bro, it was amazing. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1010.24s)]
*  That's so fire. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1011.36s)]
*  Yeah, it was amazing. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1011.6800000000001s)]
*  Bro, he is Zlatan the whole time. Even like as we were leaving, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1012.1600000000001s)]
*  Dove was like, oh, you should come do standup. And he's like, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1015.0400000000001s)]
*  you'd be lucky if I showed up to the show. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1017.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1018.96s)]
*  No, no, no, wait, hold on. We offered to come on the podcast and he's like, why? Why would you do [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1019.44s)]
*  this? You have to give him something that he hasn't done. We're like, look, open up for Schultz, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1024.32s)]
*  two minutes, and then his eyes lit up. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1028.48s)]
*  Maybe we work on this. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1031.1200000000001s)]
*  And then he goes and starts speaking different languages. He says, I could do it in any language. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1032.8000000000002s)]
*  He goes Italian. He goes, what else did he Swedish? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1036.24s)]
*  No, it was fire. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1039.76s)]
*  Bro, legends. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1040.48s)]
*  Yeah, it was cool. Just meeting Dana and Hunter and all the guys, it was really cool. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1041.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1044.64s)]
*  It was really cool. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1044.88s)]
*  And shout out to Rogan, man, setting it up with the tickets, bro. That was, that was fun. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1046.16s)]
*  Yeah, legends. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1049.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we rolled deep. That's the other thing. We rolled deep. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1050.0800000000002s)]
*  Whenever I ask for tickets, it's an asshole thing to do. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1053.3600000000001s)]
*  How many do you need is my least favorite question again, because it's a lot. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1056.64s)]
*  And then he made it happen. It was really fucking cool. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1060.96s)]
*  That's very cool. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1063.68s)]
*  Announcement. The Life Tour is coming back to America. Okay. We announced the first three [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1064.72s)]

*  We added a second show. Melbourne. That was insane. Show is officially sold out. Thank you [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1094.56s)]

*  the Life Tour back home in the States coming very soon. Stay tuned in for those. Peace. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1120.72s)]
*  I'm going to be in DC January 26 and 27th. Salt Lake City, Utah. Get those tickets at AkashSingh.com. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1146.48s)]
*  Awesome fight card. Let's go to another awesome fight card. You were at the Logan Paul fight. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1169.1200000000001s)]
*  Yes. So that was awesome. Yes. Yeah. No. Yeah. I mean, the KSI Tommy Fury fight [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1173.12s)]
*  sucks, man. It was just so bad. Tommy Fury is really not good. Yeah. He's like really bad. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1180.9599999999998s)]
*  He's really bad at boxing. And like- Well, compared to what? [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1186.4799999999998s)]
*  At this point, we don't know, but like- Professional boxer. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1190.4799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Compared to what he should be, which is a professional boxer. Especially when your brother's [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1192.8s)]
*  going to him. He comes from a legacy of like boxing. Like he's just been around it his entire [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1197.12s)]
*  life. He should absorb it. And listen, here's the thing. KSI has this really weird style, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1201.6s)]
*  which actually makes sense for how little he's been boxing. He has power and he has speed. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1206.32s)]
*  So you curate a style that works for what you have. He's not going to outbox a guy who's been [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1211.9199999999998s)]
*  boxing for 15 years by standing in front of him. You have to curate a style that maximizes the [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1217.4399999999998s)]
*  things that you do well. So he was doing this karate kind of stance and really creating [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1222.08s)]
*  distance then lunging in. Tommy could do absolutely nothing to mitigate it. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1227.12s)]
*  Yeah. Like there was no adjustment made. What do you think the adjustment is? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1232.08s)]
*  You beat him to the punch with a straight right. Okay. Or you get the jab going. He kind of stuck [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1236.1599999999999s)]
*  the jab a little bit and then kind of stopped, but no change happened. I think Tommy probably [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1240.8s)]
*  won the fight. It was close, but it shouldn't be close. Yeah. KSI's got 15 other fucking jobs. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1246.0s)]
*  And I don't know why Tommy was like staying with the grab because that only helps KSI. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1250.8s)]
*  Push him off you and box it. He was just like, no, it was bad. Yeah. That was a shitty fight [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1257.12s)]
*  to watch. And the other one was worse. Actually, that was the only fight of the night, really. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1263.36s)]
*  You can't even call that a fight. Bro, the Logan fight went exactly how we thought. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1269.52s)]
*  Yeah. It was a decision Logan. And then obviously I didn't think that Dylan was going to outbox him. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1273.6799999999998s)]
*  I thought Dylan would box. I actually thought Dylan would win because he sat so confidently [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1279.12s)]
*  in this seat and was like, I'm fucking going. I thought he was going to do a little bit more [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1283.52s)]
*  of what he did. At least I called it. I knew he was going to do some UFC shit. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1287.12s)]
*  That was figured. Because I know he's like, hey, I don't want to take an L. So I'd be like, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1291.36s)]
*  nah, I stopped because I started fighting. That's what I figured. But I didn't think he would not [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1295.84s)]
*  throw punches for five and a half rounds or whatever. And then just try to, and even to get [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1300.8799999999999s)]
*  the take down. But he's also sad to watch. Yeah. I mean, you got to give Logan credit for him not [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1304.8s)]
*  wanting to engage as much. Logan boxed well. Logan did box well. He was landing punches and [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1309.6799999999998s)]
*  Dylan kept pressuring him the entire fight. It's not like Dylan just sat in the corner. It was [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1317.52s)]
*  running. Dylan kept pressing, but he couldn't get off. He couldn't get off. Logan's coach, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1321.9199999999998s)]
*  you got to thank him because he was just throwing crazy punches in the beginning. If he would have [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1326.56s)]
*  stayed doing that, he would have tired out. He would have made a mistake. And that's- [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1331.28s)]
*  Oh, and what? Logan's coach said chill. Yeah. Logan's coach is like, yo, chill. Don't make a [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1334.56s)]
*  mistake. Pick your spot. And that's what he made that adjustment and it was a wrap. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1338.56s)]
*  Because Dylan was just hoping that he would just got tired out. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1341.76s)]
*  Yeah. And then he was going to land something big. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1344.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Dylan wore those punches though. He took big shots and walked them down. That was impressive. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1346.24s)]
*  I kind of expected that he wouldn't get knocked out, but the level of shots, even body shots, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1353.2s)]
*  it just kept on walking. It just kept coming forward. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1357.36s)]
*  Yeah. I just thought he would throw, I don't know, three punches. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1359.28s)]
*  Yeah. No, you want him to be more active and throw more, but you got to give Logan credit [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1362.72s)]
*  for that. Listen, if punches aren't landing on you, it's very easy to throw punches. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1366.08s)]
*  But when they are landing on you, you're worried about that defense. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1370.3999999999999s)]
*  You're worried about getting caught. And he got caught in a second. I thought Logan was [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1373.52s)]
*  going to drop him in a second. This motherfucker ain't going down. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1376.8s)]
*  You got to think Dylan's calculation though is don't get knocked out. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1378.96s)]
*  Yeah. If you don't get knocked out, it's a draw. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1381.36s)]
*  His win is not getting knocked out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I guess. I don't know. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1383.36s)]
*  He had to fight. He didn't fight. I thought if he lost like a warrior, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1387.6799999999998s)]
*  just based on the way he presented the fight, all right, cool, man. You went out, you got hit. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1392.96s)]
*  You did your fucking thing. And I don't know much, but I just saw this weird defensive stance, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1396.4s)]
*  didn't throw any punches. And that's where I was like, dude, what is this? This is wasting my life. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1401.68s)]
*  I'm 39. I don't know how long I'm going to live. This is life that I could be living. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1406.8s)]
*  Doing anything else, watching a blank screen. I'm not going to lie. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1411.8400000000001s)]
*  I just feel meditative. He owes you 18 minutes. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1414.8s)]
*  You owe me 18 minutes, Doug. But the Logan, the Logan, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1417.04s)]
*  Dana's fight was interesting and entertaining. The crowd was into it. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1420.16s)]
*  Yeah. To you. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1423.3600000000001s)]
*  No, not to me. To everybody there. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1424.4s)]
*  Yeah. The energy was insane to everybody there, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1426.72s)]
*  because there was action. You have to understand, even if Dylan's just getting pounded by Logan, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1430.96s)]
*  that's still what people are there to see. They're there to see a fight. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1436.0800000000002s)]
*  The KSI Tommy fight was hugging the whole time. Yeah. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1439.0400000000002s)]
*  Maybe a punch, but that was beyond boring. So interesting you say that. It's probably just [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1441.76s)]
*  it's different being in the room, because watching that on TV, it's like the Logan, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1446.16s)]
*  Dana's fight was boring as fuck. Really? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1450.72s)]
*  Like that's how, yeah. At least with the KSI shit, it's like, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1452.96s)]
*  all right, he's trying. He's not, doesn't look good, but he's trying. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1455.6000000000001s)]
*  Completely opposite in the arena. Because like, snooze fest for the second one, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1459.2s)]
*  people starting to look at their phones, like do other things, like booing. And again, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1464.0s)]
*  this is their hometown. And it was just like, what the fuck is going on here? But Dylan, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1468.0800000000002s)]
*  Logan was like, big shots are getting landed. Oh, wow. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1472.56s)]
*  Big. I see I felt bored watching both. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1475.84s)]
*  Yeah. Interesting. And the second one was a bit more fun to watch. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1477.6799999999998s)]
*  It was more fun, but again, it was more frustrating than boring. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1480.48s)]
*  Yeah. Because it was like, anytime there was action, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1483.84s)]
*  hug, hug, hug, hug. And that was, I guess, frustrating and not boring. The Logan, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1485.6s)]
*  Dylan fight, I found myself bored. Again, maybe I just expected Dylan to throw, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1489.6799999999998s)]
*  and I don't know boxing, so maybe I was an idiot who bought a whatever, got sold a bill of goods [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1494.0s)]
*  by Dylan. But I thought Dylan was going to throw. Logan threw. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1498.56s)]
*  It's so interesting how the narrative changed. The narrative was, he won't even show up. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1501.9199999999998s)]
*  And that changed for you to, well, why isn't he just going in there and beating the shit up? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1510.48s)]
*  Because that's what he said. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1517.04s)]
*  He also said he was going to show up to the other fights and then didn't show up. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1518.8799999999999s)]
*  Before he even came out, I was sitting there and Mike was next to me, he was like, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1523.36s)]
*  do you think he's going to walk out? Wow. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1528.24s)]
*  So there was a moment even before the fight started was, is this fight going to happen? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1530.32s)]
*  Yeah. I got pretty convinced it was going to happen. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1534.48s)]
*  Yeah. But you're still thinking about it a little bit. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1536.64s)]
*  And the narrative is so shifted to now, it's like, yo, why didn't he go there and beat the shit up? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1538.48s)]
*  Yeah. The energy inside the room, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1542.24s)]
*  though, a little bit to me felt like high school, after school fight energy. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1544.32s)]
*  But that makes perfect sense. And that's what all these YouTube [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1549.36s)]
*  fights are going to be about, that because they're not watching for the skill. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1552.4s)]
*  It feels like a little weirder, though. I didn't enjoy the energy as much. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1555.1999999999998s)]
*  Like you go to like a real boxing match, like a UFC fight, and it's like a bunch of fight [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1558.8s)]
*  fans that are ready to see like two warriors really like trying to help. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1561.6799999999998s)]
*  And just high level skill. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1564.08s)]
*  I can see how you get put off by that after enough, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1565.04s)]
*  like you're in it long enough and you're like, you know what, I don't really like. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1567.84s)]
*  Because like a lot of people try to be seen, like a lot of people, like there's fights [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1569.9199999999998s)]
*  breaking out, which is common in fight sports, but like just felt like everyone had cameras. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1573.28s)]
*  Oh, that's a lot of it. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1576.7199999999998s)]
*  Fan six interviews for Andrew. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1577.6799999999998s)]
*  Everybody's trying to get a clip. Everybody's trying to get a clip of something. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1579.36s)]
*  Video taping you and clip it, clip it, clip it. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1584.24s)]
*  Every person coming up to you and Mike is trying to like get you in some sort of weird situation [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1586.96s)]
*  where they have this viral video is from it. Yeah, that I agree. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1591.36s)]
*  And that was an uncomfortable energy to be around, because I never feel that I had a fight. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1595.84s)]
*  Like when I was at the UFC, it's like every single person there was some form of influencer [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1599.52s)]
*  that was going to potentially use me in a compromising situation to get views. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1603.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1608.32s)]
*  And feeling that every person that asks, I'm not someone who says no to pictures. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1608.96s)]
*  No, somebody says no to video. I always say every single time, but every time I went into it, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1612.8000000000002s)]
*  I was like, who is this person and how are they going to try to exploit me? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1616.4s)]
*  Did anybody get you? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1620.0s)]
*  No, like I was pretty sharp on it. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1621.52s)]
*  He was locked in. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1624.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1625.44s)]
*  I was like, you see him on stage is the same vibe. Like while people were like coming out to him, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1625.68s)]
*  he's like, hi, okay, this person, he's like triangulating. I don't even know if you drank [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1630.0800000000002s)]
*  at all. You were like. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1635.3600000000001s)]
*  No, I was pretty sharp. And I said the same thing in every single interview. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1636.4s)]
*  Every single interview. This is the Charlemagne tactic that I learned from the red carpet. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1640.5600000000002s)]
*  I was just going to say that. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1644.5600000000002s)]
*  It's like when I was on the red carpet with him and MTV days, he's such a genius. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1645.52s)]
*  He would have his shtick ready for whatever they were going to ask him out because they're [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1649.2s)]
*  going to ask the same question every single time. So he had his bit ready to go. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1652.96s)]
*  And it kind of kills their clip. Like if they're just using you for a clip, it's like, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1657.44s)]
*  oh, they're sick to me saying the same thing. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1660.48s)]
*  The opposite. It gives them a better clip. Here's your funny thing. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1662.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1666.88s)]
*  Here's your funny thing that you could clip. But now it's on my terms, not your terms. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1667.4399999999998s)]
*  And your terms are always going to be the most lo-fi. So it's just what is this funny little [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1671.84s)]
*  anecdote that you could give them? So I just had my thing ready to go and I was just like, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1676.56s)]
*  whatever they're coming to ask you. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1679.76s)]
*  After seeing those fights, is there any interest left for [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1680.9599999999998s)]
*  influencer fighters? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1686.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1687.1999999999998s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1687.36s)]
*  KSI Jake, you can watch. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1687.6799999999998s)]
*  Really? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1688.8s)]
*  This is the thing that people- [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1690.4799999999998s)]
*  You want to see KSI. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1691.1999999999998s)]
*  It's not about that. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1692.4799999999998s)]
*  Can I counterpoint? Did you care at all to see Dylan and Jake? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1693.28s)]
*  Dylan and Logan, before they started doing promo. These guys are also entertainers by trade. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1697.04s)]
*  They're great at promoting their fights. So every fight, pretty much, when it was announced, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1701.28s)]
*  for the most part, I've been like, eh. And then by the end, I'm like, all right, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1705.28s)]
*  I want to see how this goes. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1708.6399999999999s)]
*  So maybe Jake is probably the only one because we actually see him getting better, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1710.6399999999999s)]
*  but the others aren't necessarily getting better. It's like- [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1715.44s)]
*  Yeah, but look at your metric for interest. Your metric for interest is skill. You're like, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1719.36s)]
*  they're getting better at the skill and I want to see skill. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1724.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1726.08s)]
*  It's a high school, after school fight. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1726.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1730.56s)]
*  Which I'm interested in every single time. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1731.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1733.36s)]
*  Right? If I see two people on the subway arguing with each other and I think it's going to- [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1734.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm locked in. And once that is your expectation, and the more you're invested [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1738.08s)]
*  in one of those sides, the more you're going to see it. So it's not about the skill. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1742.6399999999999s)]
*  It's about these two people that you really care about, you either really love or really hate, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1746.1599999999999s)]
*  and you want to see justice. Right? And- [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1749.84s)]
*  If I switched my outlook, then maybe I can appreciate- [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1753.28s)]
*  You liked fighting before this. A lot of these kids that are watching, I think, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1755.6s)]
*  weren't fight fans. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1758.6399999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1759.6s)]
*  I think they grew up in YouTube spaces. They're watching streaming. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1760.6399999999999s)]
*  It's not surprising, but you go there and you're like- [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1764.7199999999998s)]
*  Much younger crowd. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1766.08s)]
*  14-year-olds, 15-year-olds. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1766.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1768.48s)]
*  Like, oh, not you. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1768.56s)]
*  Yeah. And so it's like they grew up watching soccer. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1770.0s)]
*  Like, being a fight fan doesn't happen unless you're like a legacy fight fan. Like, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1773.6799999999998s)]
*  my dad got me into fighting early. You don't get into fighting until a little bit later. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1776.9599999999998s)]
*  Maybe as an adult, you start to box for exercise and you're like, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1780.8799999999999s)]
*  this is kind of fun. You start watching some boxing matches, et cetera. Or you have a friend [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1783.52s)]
*  who's really into it. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1786.8799999999999s)]
*  That's because we had Mike Tyson. So it's like- [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1787.52s)]
*  We had this golden age of fucking boxing that we came up in. And even then, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1789.44s)]
*  it's not even the biggest sport. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1794.72s)]
*  To me, it felt like if it was a Mike Tyson fight, everybody stopped what the fuck they [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1796.8799999999999s)]
*  were doing that night and had the TBO. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1801.52s)]
*  Or if they had what you could call YouTube culture surrounding, which is like those 24-7s. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1803.52s)]
*  So HBO did those 24-7 series and all of a sudden, exactly. You're like, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1810.32s)]
*  now I'm invested in this person. That's what these streamers are doing all the time. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1813.36s)]
*  That's what these YouTubers are doing. They're getting you invested. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1816.1599999999999s)]
*  So if you're going to see the person that you love go into a situation where they could get [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1818.4799999999998s)]
*  knocked out, I kind of watch. So I don't think it affects it at all. I mean, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1821.76s)]
*  the shit was sold the fuck out. It was crazy. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1825.9199999999998s)]
*  Oh, yeah. They made some money. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1827.84s)]
*  Yeah. And they were there early. Like, it wasn't, they just like, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1830.08s)]
*  with regular boxing, people show up for the last fight. That shit was packed when we showed up. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1833.12s)]
*  No word. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1836.9599999999998s)]
*  Packed. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1837.6799999999998s)]
*  Wow. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1838.08s)]
*  Yeah. So I think it's just about making sure there's a reason to see people fight. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1839.04s)]
*  Like if Jake wanted to fight Logan right now, you don't think that that would do crazy numbers? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1844.1599999999999s)]
*  That one we need to see. That's the one we need to see, but I don't think we're ever going to see that. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1848.1599999999999s)]
*  I think we could see that. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1852.32s)]
*  I don't think we see that. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1855.76s)]
*  I think we will see. I think we will see that. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1856.8799999999999s)]
*  I don't think we see that. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1858.8799999999999s)]
*  I think we will see that. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1859.6s)]
*  Do we want to see that? Logan? [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1860.96s)]
*  I don't want that. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1862.24s)]
*  Logan don't want that. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1863.12s)]
*  This guy's trying to gas it up. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1864.48s)]
*  I'm just saying. Logan's biggest op. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1866.8799999999999s)]
*  Logan don't want no problems. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1869.4399999999998s)]
*  I think at the end of the day, these guys are entertainers. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1870.8s)]
*  He fixes fights. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1872.6399999999999s)]
*  And they know what will make money and what will sell. They sell very well. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1873.76s)]
*  And nothing will sell better. No fight, maybe in history, will sell better than that. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1877.28s)]
*  I'm not saying there'll be the best fight or even necessarily a good fight. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1881.4399999999998s)]
*  No fight will have as high stakes as that ever. I'm fighting my brother. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1884.56s)]
*  I mean, who the fuck is not interested? [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1889.76s)]
*  Logan ain't gonna do that. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1892.64s)]
*  You saw after that fight, he's like, Ray Mysterio, I got you, bro. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1894.96s)]
*  That's what he want. He want a five-foot Mexican. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1901.04s)]
*  Anybody else still a little high? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1905.04s)]
*  No. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1906.88s)]
*  Come on, Aka. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1907.38s)]
*  Do you think Dylan goes UFC? [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1909.52s)]
*  You see him, he pulled out of Bellator, I think. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1912.0s)]
*  Yeah, he said he won't release from Bellator. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1914.3200000000002s)]
*  I mean, that's the most logical move for him. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1916.16s)]
*  But he needs to get training and he needs to train the hands, too. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1919.28s)]
*  The Jiu-Jitsu is nice. He's gonna be in the UFC and he's gonna be better than everybody [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1923.76s)]
*  in the UFC at Jiu-Jitsu. You have that. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1926.96s)]
*  But we've seen people who are nice at Jiu-Jitsu, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1928.4s)]
*  when they go up against guys that can mitigate the Jiu-Jitsu and have hands, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1930.56s)]
*  they have real fucking problems. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1933.76s)]
*  So he needs to get in there, take it serious and do it. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1935.28s)]
*  Now, if you're the UFC, you go, this guy can sell the fuck out of a fight. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1938.0s)]
*  He just sold a million pay-per-view. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1942.4s)]
*  And people were not tuning in for KSI Tommy. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1943.92s)]
*  They're tuning in for Logan and Dylan. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1946.32s)]
*  So he can sell fights. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1948.8s)]
*  So if it's not UFC, maybe it's another one of these fledgling [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1950.88s)]
*  promotional companies that wants to get after it. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1955.28s)]
*  And they could give the bag to a guy who could sell the fuck out of a fight. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1957.84s)]
*  So let's see if he wants to do it. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1962.24s)]
*  Three things. Did they drop the lawsuit? [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1963.68s)]
*  I don't know. That's a good question. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1966.96s)]
*  I gotta ask. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1968.48s)]
*  Why is Logan not fighting him in the MMA? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1969.6000000000001s)]
*  Because he shook hands and said he would fight him if he shows up to the fight? [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1973.84s)]
*  Or I don't know if he gives his purse away. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1977.9199999999998s)]
*  If he gives his purse away. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1979.52s)]
*  So it's like both of them need to honor their... [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1980.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. That's interesting. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1983.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think Logan should do that. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1985.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's going to be tough. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1987.36s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think he should do that. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1989.12s)]
*  I mean, he shouldn't, but he said he was going to do it. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1990.1599999999999s)]
*  And well, there's a perfect example. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1992.6399999999999s)]
*  People will pay for that fight. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1994.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1995.36s)]
*  Because now it's like you even it up. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1997.6s)]
*  You got power, you got height, you got reach, but he got the grab. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=1999.6799999999998s)]
*  You want to do a crazy fight right now? [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2002.8799999999999s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2004.6399999999999s)]
*  Let me get into my promotional... [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2005.76s)]
*  I'm kidding. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2007.2s)]
*  You ready? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2007.7s)]
*  Same night. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2008.88s)]
*  Nate Diaz versus Jake Paul, MMA. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2011.76s)]
*  Logan versus Dylan, MMA. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2014.56s)]
*  Truth. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2016.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's fine. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2017.3s)]
*  Yeah, I'm paying for that. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2017.68s)]
*  I'll go. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2018.8s)]
*  We're going. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2019.3s)]
*  We're going. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2020.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2020.9s)]
*  We're going. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2021.52s)]
*  Perfect example. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2022.72s)]
*  You can keep dancing with this thing and keep making crazy money. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2023.52s)]
*  And as long as the guys are walking out and they're okay, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2027.3600000000001s)]
*  like the bare-knuckle thing is different. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2030.0800000000002s)]
*  You see what someone looks like after a bare-knuckle fight. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2031.44s)]
*  That's true. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2033.3600000000001s)]
*  It's rough. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2034.16s)]
*  Yeah, you're different. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2035.3600000000001s)]
*  Your face is different. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2036.16s)]
*  I wonder if you take less damage in an MMA fight if you get choked. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2036.72s)]
*  Yeah, they say that with MMA, it's like less cerebral damage. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2039.92s)]
*  With boxing, it's just constant. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2044.88s)]
*  It's like you're an offensive lineman or something like that. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2046.32s)]
*  It's just constant power. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2048.08s)]
*  Fight through concussions or whatever you call it. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2049.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2050.7200000000003s)]
*  But yeah, that would be... [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2052.32s)]

*  That is cage right there. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2054.56s)]
*  That's one. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2059.52s)]
*  Yeah, that'd be crazy. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2060.08s)]
*  All right, guys. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2061.12s)]
*  We just talked sports, so you know what that means. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2061.52s)]
*  It's prize-picks times. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2063.28s)]

*  They got embarrassed last week in Philly. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2076.0s)]
*  It will not happen again. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2077.6s)]
*  They will bounce back. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2078.4s)]
*  And Adam Thielen will get less than 68.5 yards receiving. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2079.6800000000003s)]
*  I just don't believe it. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2083.84s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2084.96s)]
*  I love you, Adam Thielen, but I don't believe in it. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2085.92s)]
*  So those are your prize picks. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2088.48s)]

*  Manchester was cool, man. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2107.1200000000003s)]
*  We had a good vibe. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2108.56s)]
*  It's cool to see like tribal white people. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2109.44s)]
*  Because y'all aren't allowed to do that here. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2112.8s)]
*  Well, the only- [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2114.1600000000003s)]
*  Not that cool to see that. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2115.28s)]
*  The only- [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2116.0800000000004s)]
*  It's not that cool. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2116.4s)]
*  It's a couple January 6th. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2118.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, you look that. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2120.88s)]
*  What? [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2121.92s)]
*  The only tribal white- [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2123.04s)]
*  January 6th looked pretty fun. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2124.3199999999997s)]
*  We can be completely objective here. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2126.7999999999997s)]
*  Fun, not fun? [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2128.7999999999997s)]
*  Didn't seem not fun. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2130.08s)]
*  All right, baby. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2131.04s)]
*  You wouldn't get the pay-per-view to watch the January 6th? [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2132.24s)]
*  You wouldn't just watch it from home? [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2134.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2135.7599999999998s)]
*  Watch fucking Pelosi running around. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2137.44s)]
*  Yeah, it'd be awesome. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2139.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2140.64s)]
*  It was just, when you're in England, you get to see like tribal whites. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2142.88s)]
*  And in America, you only see like Italians that are like that, really, like culturally tribal. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2146.56s)]
*  The Irish a bit, but I think the Irish are like so mixed in general. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2150.96s)]
*  So it's like you go there and within 30 minutes distance, they speak completely differently. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2156.48s)]
*  Liverpool to Manchester, the accents are completely different. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2162.0s)]
*  They're culturally different. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2164.88s)]
*  The way they identify is completely different. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2166.2400000000002s)]
*  The way they relate to the crown is completely different. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2168.56s)]
*  And yeah, you get how like the soccer teams and the football teams are a manifestation of that tribalism. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2171.36s)]
*  So everything you feel about your town, you get to express through this game. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2178.24s)]
*  And when you're playing against this other town, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2182.72s)]
*  that probably thousands of years ago, you guys used to fucking go to war with and shit. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2184.4799999999996s)]
*  That's why they'll fight. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2188.7999999999997s)]
*  What are they, the hooligans? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2189.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2190.9599999999996s)]
*  And they are distinctly different. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2192.4799999999996s)]
*  Like an hour away. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2195.04s)]
*  Like in New York, there's an accent from the Bronx to Brooklyn, like a little bit different. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2197.12s)]
*  The way that the scouts speak in Liverpool is for one hour different. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2201.52s)]
*  It is the same as from Texas to Mexico. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2209.04s)]
*  No, bro. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2214.16s)]
*  It is crazy. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2216.64s)]
*  But they look the same. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2218.3199999999997s)]
*  They just sound the same. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2219.2s)]
*  Dress the same, act the same. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2220.56s)]
*  And then they say the word chicken. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2222.0s)]
*  Chicken. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2225.52s)]
*  Chicken. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2227.9199999999996s)]
*  Coke. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2229.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2232.3199999999997s)]
*  That's Liverpool. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2233.8399999999997s)]
*  That's Liverpool. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2234.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2235.7599999999998s)]
*  So it was like, I don't know, it's cool to go see that. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2236.64s)]
*  And then obviously going up to Scotland was the shit. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2239.28s)]
*  Oh yeah, we linked up with your family. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2241.36s)]
*  Yeah, my family all came out. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2242.8s)]
*  That's fire. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2244.1600000000003s)]
*  Doing a show in fucking Scotland. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2244.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2246.56s)]
*  And yeah, it was just, that was an honor. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2247.2000000000003s)]
*  That was really fucking cool. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2249.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's amazing. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2250.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2250.96s)]
*  Now I want to ask you also, Royal Albert Music Hall? [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2251.84s)]
*  Royal Albert Hall, yeah. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2254.88s)]
*  Royal Albert Hall. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2255.76s)]
*  It's like a historic venue, Burr filmed a special there. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2256.88s)]
*  What was that like? [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2259.04s)]
*  Oh, that was crazy. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2259.84s)]
*  I mean, like that venue was just... [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2260.8s)]
*  That's one of the bucket lists of dream venues. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2262.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's beautiful. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2265.44s)]
*  It was beautiful. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2266.56s)]
*  This is like this gigantic organ in the back and like, it's stunning. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2267.44s)]
*  It's like massive, but also intimate. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2270.8s)]
*  And yeah, it was just unbelievable to be there. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2273.44s)]
*  And you know, Emma's whole family was there. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2276.64s)]
*  That's the first time they've ever seen me. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2278.4s)]
*  Holy shit, that's a pretty good way to meet. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2279.92s)]
*  So there was another expectation. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2281.36s)]
*  And this hour anybody's seen is like by far the most intimate and personal hour that I've ever done. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2283.12s)]
*  So like it raises the stakes when they're there. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2289.44s)]
*  But it also lets them meet you, get to know you, and see you being successful. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2293.76s)]
*  Or all in an hour without you having to do it right here. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2300.0s)]
*  So it's kind of nice if it goes well. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2303.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean, the risks are there, but if it goes well, great, we're good. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2304.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it was so weird. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2307.6000000000004s)]
*  It's like I wasn't nervous. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2308.2400000000002s)]
*  I was just hyper aware of anything sexual. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2309.1200000000003s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2312.0800000000004s)]
*  Like I was confident it would go well, but anytime that they were like sexual references, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2312.7200000000003s)]
*  I was like, oh wow, her family is here. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2320.64s)]
*  Whereas if I'm doing it in Ireland, I didn't even thought about it. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2323.44s)]
*  Do you ever change stuff with your girl's family? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2329.12s)]
*  Has her family seen you? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2331.2s)]
*  Her mom has seen me perform, her dad has not, and I definitely softened it a bit. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2332.64s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2338.0s)]
*  I don't, yeah, even stuff about her, my mother-in-law loves her. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2338.48s)]
*  But I definitely softened it a bit. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2344.48s)]
*  Did you soften it a bit? [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2345.68s)]
*  Come on, let's see. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2347.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2348.24s)]
*  This guy, I was there when you did it too. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2349.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2351.52s)]
*  That was so weird. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2352.16s)]
*  It was my family was there. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2353.2799999999997s)]
*  My mom was there. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2354.8799999999997s)]
*  My whole shit. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2355.52s)]
*  And then it didn't work or something like that? [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2356.8799999999997s)]
*  No, it did better, it did way better. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2358.56s)]
*  Standing o, I think. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2361.2s)]
*  I think it was a standing o. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2362.16s)]
*  I'm pretty sure. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2363.44s)]
*  Oh, we gotta talk. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2364.3199999999997s)]
*  Bro, dude, we gotta talk. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2366.16s)]
*  Okay, so we're in the Netherlands, right? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2367.9199999999996s)]
*  And the Netherlands is like, we're gonna show on Amsterdam, beautiful city, unbelievable city, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2369.44s)]
*  but the Netherlands, these are like the most literal people you'll ever meet in your life. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2373.52s)]
*  This is fun, this is fun. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2378.32s)]
*  And like a very literal people, right? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2379.92s)]
*  And they actually have like a history of American comedy being there. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2382.1600000000003s)]
*  There's this show called Raymond is Lot, like late night with Raymond or whatever, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2384.7200000000003s)]
*  he would bring American comics. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2387.76s)]
*  So they're aware of like American comedy and they've been fans for like decades. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2388.8s)]
*  So good place to go perform, but understand very literal. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2392.4s)]
*  Like I was even joking around with the guys, but this is a 100% serious thing. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2396.6400000000003s)]
*  Like I was in the hotel, this is how literal. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2399.28s)]
*  I'm in the hotel and I walked by a guy and I was like, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2400.88s)]
*  I was like, hey, what's up, man? [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2403.2000000000003s)]
*  How you doing? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2404.4s)]
*  Just like that's what we would say to somebody as you walk by them. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2404.96s)]
*  And he goes, I'm a little sad today. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2408.56s)]
*  Things will go better, like literally told me how he's doing. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2416.0s)]
*  So I know this because I performed in Amsterdam, we did the special like I'm [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2420.64s)]
*  aware of what I'm gonna get. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2424.2400000000002s)]
*  And Mark, before he goes on, he goes, yo, I have an idea for a joke, can I throw it by you? [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2425.6s)]
*  Yeah, I've never been to Amsterdam. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2429.84s)]
*  And so I had this Anne Frank joke that I normally do. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2431.52s)]
*  And then I had another thing is Anne Frank was from Amsterdam. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2434.0s)]
*  Her home is still there. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2437.2s)]
*  So like I was trying to do this idea that I thought would be funny. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2438.4s)]
*  And like after you do the set so many times, you're like, yeah, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2440.8s)]
*  I just want to do something new, something local, something fun. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2442.72s)]
*  So I was like, okay, it's interesting to me that like two of the most famous [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2444.72s)]
*  people from Amsterdam is Vincent van Gogh and Anne Frank. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2447.84s)]
*  Vincent van Gogh famously cut off his ear. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2451.68s)]
*  And it's just funny to me that two most famous people, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2454.72s)]
*  one of them can't hear anything and the other one can't speak. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2456.48s)]
*  Van Gogh, Anne Frank. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2459.52s)]
*  I was like, this would be kind of a funny idea we could play with. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2460.4s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2462.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2463.04s)]
*  Now, so I go, let me tell you something. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2463.28s)]
*  Van Gogh can, this is how Van Gogh can hear. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2468.7200000000003s)]
*  He just doesn't have an ear. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2471.84s)]
*  And Anne Frank can speak, she just shouldn't. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2473.76s)]
*  And that's how they're going to interpret this. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2477.36s)]
*  They're not going to be able to like remove it a little bit. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2480.32s)]
*  And you know what I mean? [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2483.52s)]
*  Like, oh, I see what you're doing. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2484.56s)]
*  They're literally going to be like, that is incorrect. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2487.36s)]
*  Anne Frank could speak all the time. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2491.04s)]
*  She spoke a lot. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2492.64s)]
*  So they made me go riff on it. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2493.44s)]
*  So I was like, all right, that's good input from Andrew, you know, hater. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2494.56s)]
*  And so I was like, let's go ask some Dutch people and see what they think. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2497.52s)]
*  So I asked like two Dutch guys and they're like, yeah, they laughed. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2500.16s)]
*  Yeah, that makes sense. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2502.4s)]
*  Like you could probably do something with that. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2503.12s)]
*  So I went up and did that shit. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2504.56s)]
*  They took it very literally. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2507.44s)]
*  So literally. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2511.04s)]
*  And then afterwards, the guy goes, hey, the joke worked. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2513.3599999999997s)]
*  And we're like, no, it didn't. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2515.8399999999997s)]
*  And then we're like, what did you think he meant? [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2517.44s)]
*  I go, what do you think he meant when he goes, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2520.16s)]
*  Anne Frank can speak? [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2521.76s)]
*  He goes, oh, well, because she's dead. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2522.6400000000003s)]
*  When you're dead, you can't speak. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2529.2000000000003s)]
*  That is literal. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2531.92s)]
*  God damn it, dude. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2534.6400000000003s)]
*  It was fun. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2537.0400000000004s)]
*  Yeah, Amsterdam was cool. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2537.76s)]
*  And we just went for a walk, dude. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2539.2000000000003s)]
*  We just kind of just walked around. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2540.6400000000003s)]
*  Oh, yeah, hit that red light. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2542.1600000000003s)]
*  What did you do? [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2544.96s)]
*  Did you do anything? [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2545.44s)]
*  No, you just. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2546.1600000000003s)]
*  Substances? [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2546.7200000000003s)]
*  No, substances while you're out there. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2547.36s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2548.6400000000003s)]
*  Just drink, whatever. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2549.5200000000004s)]
*  You can't really. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2550.56s)]
*  That's actually good. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2551.2799999999997s)]
*  What did Dove and Vala do? [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2552.16s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2553.6s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2555.2799999999997s)]
*  You can't really? [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2556.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2556.96s)]
*  You can't smoke while you're walking around. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2558.7999999999997s)]
*  Vala did smoke. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2561.2799999999997s)]
*  That was too fast. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2561.92s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2562.64s)]
*  It was too quick. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2562.96s)]
*  Because I know another day. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2563.6s)]
*  I thought you meant like, actually, like real drugs, not like weed. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2564.64s)]
*  Yeah, you can say red. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2568.08s)]
*  Yeah, come on. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2569.36s)]
*  We know what we're talking about. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2570.08s)]
*  Dove was negotiating. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2571.2799999999997s)]
*  He's not going to rate just to see what the deal was. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2572.32s)]
*  He just wanted to know the deal points. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2574.4s)]
*  We were window shopping. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2575.68s)]
*  That's the truth. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2576.64s)]
*  I mean, it is so much fun. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2577.44s)]
*  I get why women do it. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2579.04s)]
*  If they look at clothing the way we look at pussy, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2581.04s)]
*  it makes total sense to just go out to stores. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2583.44s)]
*  Just see what they have. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2585.84s)]
*  Because that's what we did, and I could have done that for six hours straight. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2587.6800000000003s)]
*  Walk by the horse rooms. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2590.6400000000003s)]

*  And all, not all, but like bad. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2599.52s)]
*  Not like. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2603.04s)]
*  That's what Blat was saying. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2603.44s)]
*  I was telling us that. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2604.2400000000002s)]
*  Bad. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2604.88s)]
*  We're not talking about just like American street horse. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2606.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2609.28s)]
*  They look like that's what they have to do. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2610.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2611.8399999999997s)]
*  They human track the crop of the creme, the creme of the crop. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2612.3199999999997s)]
*  Oh, whatever that fucking. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2615.52s)]
*  I got it. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2616.48s)]
*  I got it. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2616.96s)]
*  It's almost. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2617.2799999999997s)]
*  It's regulated. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2618.16s)]
*  They're getting money from it. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2618.72s)]
*  What was it? [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2619.8399999999997s)]
*  The crop of the creme was crazy. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2620.48s)]
*  Cream of the crop. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2622.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2622.96s)]
*  There we go. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2623.52s)]
*  The cum of the crop. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2624.0s)]
*  That's what it technically is. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2625.2799999999997s)]
*  So if you like. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2626.16s)]
*  Now, what does that even mean? [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2628.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2629.52s)]
*  The cream of the crop. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2630.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2630.72s)]
*  You know, our crops are creamy. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2631.3599999999997s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2634.0s)]
*  It doesn't mean anything. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2634.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2635.6s)]
*  You're right. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2635.9199999999996s)]
*  I know you're actually right about that. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2636.3999999999996s)]
*  It's a stupid saying. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2638.0s)]
*  You got it wrong, but you're right. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2639.36s)]
*  I'm from the acidity. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2640.7200000000003s)]
*  You're so literal. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2642.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm literal. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2642.8s)]
*  I should know that. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2643.28s)]
*  Crumbs on the creme. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2643.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2644.4s)]
*  No creme on these crops. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2644.6400000000003s)]
*  Interesting place because they don't have religion, right? [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2645.76s)]
*  Religion plays no part in their daily life or the decisions that they make at all. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2650.2400000000002s)]
*  So it doesn't play any part in how they create laws. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2654.4s)]
*  Right? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2658.6400000000003s)]
*  You know, in America or in other countries, if you're religious, [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2658.96s)]
*  the laws kind of need to reflect the laws of God. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2663.2000000000003s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2666.56s)]
*  So without that, you can create laws that just protect the people, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2667.76s)]
*  even if they're kind of immoral. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2672.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2675.92s)]
*  Okay? [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2676.4s)]
*  Which I love. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2677.6000000000004s)]
*  Which is interesting because you can make laws that are the lesser of two evils. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2678.6400000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2683.36s)]
*  In America, you can't really do that because there'll be certain religious groups that go, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2684.2400000000002s)]
*  well, this is wrong and this is wrong. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2687.76s)]
*  Even if this is less wrong, they're both wrong, so they have to be illegal. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2690.2400000000002s)]
*  Don't compromise with you. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2693.92s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2695.04s)]
*  Can you give an example? [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2695.6s)]
*  Horse. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2697.04s)]
*  So human sex trafficking is more evil than legalized prostitution. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2698.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2703.92s)]
*  They feel like people are going to pay for pussy no matter what. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2704.3199999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2707.04s)]
*  If we legalize it, maybe there'll be less human sex trafficking. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2707.36s)]
*  These women can make money. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2711.04s)]
*  They don't have to deal with these violent pimps. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2712.48s)]
*  They will be protected. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2714.7999999999997s)]
*  And also the people that have sex with them will be safer [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2716.16s)]
*  because now we're going to make sure they get tested every week, etc. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2719.36s)]
*  So they go, this is the lesser of two evils. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2722.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2724.56s)]
*  We'll make this legal even though it's wrong and then our society will be safer. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2724.88s)]
*  And I love that because you don't fight against human nature. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2729.6s)]
*  Human nature, guys are going to go out and solicit sex workers, girls too, I guess. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2732.0s)]
*  So what is the safest way that you can curate your culture? [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2735.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2739.76s)]
*  Drugs. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2740.2400000000002s)]
*  They will test your drugs to make sure that you don't OD. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2742.2400000000002s)]
*  Because humans will never stop doing drugs. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2744.8s)]
*  We're going to do drugs. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2746.32s)]
*  So what is the lesser of two evils? [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2747.6s)]
*  That you at least are safer when you do the drugs so you don't OD [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2749.44s)]
*  and then put this crazy weight on our medical system that we're all paying for anyway. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2752.64s)]
*  So when you're in that environment, and this is a weird thing because I've never felt this in [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2757.12s)]
*  America, you kind of start, and I'm not trying to do this thing like, [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2762.08s)]
*  Europeans do it better and I fuck them. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2764.64s)]
*  But here's the thing, you start to feel like everything there is a little bit safer for you [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2766.3199999999997s)]
*  and that the government is looking out for you. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2774.0s)]
*  Like for example, if I was going to get food somewhere, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2775.92s)]
*  I would assume that the food is good for me. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2779.52s)]
*  Mm-hm. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2782.3999999999996s)]
*  Doesn't mean that the candy is good for you, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2783.12s)]
*  but I would assume there's not going to be something crazy in the food that's going to [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2785.52s)]
*  give me cancer. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2788.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2789.2s)]
*  Where in America, everything that I eat, I go, probably going to give me cancer, [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2789.52s)]
*  but it is what it is. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2792.7999999999997s)]
*  But over there, I would assume the government will go, you know what? [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2794.3999999999996s)]
*  This is going to be bad for the people if we legalize these. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2797.7599999999998s)]
*  We were literally talking about this before the podcast. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2800.3199999999997s)]
*  Food in Europe is much more regulated than America. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2802.16s)]
*  They won't have like, my wife bought Sour Patch Kids out there. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2804.56s)]
*  There's some colors that just don't exist in England where she bought it. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2807.68s)]
*  It was like licorice flavor. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2811.68s)]
*  The flavor has to be somewhat natural. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2813.44s)]
*  We can't just make Red 40 and pump it in everything or whatever. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2815.44s)]
*  Skittles could cause cancer that are banned in California. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2818.3199999999997s)]
*  They're not banned in the other 49 states. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2820.8799999999997s)]
*  We don't give a fuck. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2822.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2822.96s)]
*  You go to Europe, they're going to have a version of skittles that won't cause cancer. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2823.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2826.3199999999997s)]
*  Which they do, yeah. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2826.72s)]
*  Again, I think that's, not everything they do is better, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2828.08s)]
*  but that's a big thing they do better. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2830.56s)]
*  Yeah, it was kind of, and it was cool feeling to have while I was there. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2832.24s)]
*  And I understand why they're a little bit more obedient when it comes to rules. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2835.04s)]
*  Because they assume that the rules benefit them. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2839.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2843.36s)]
*  Like Vala said when the announcements were happening before the show, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2844.4s)]
*  they're like, guys, there'll be no filming. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2847.92s)]
*  Put your phones down. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2849.44s)]
*  You'll be asked to kick out. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2850.24s)]
*  He said he saw a hundred people take their phones and put in their pockets. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2851.52s)]
*  He's like, I've never seen that happen before. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2854.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2856.56s)]
*  Everybody hears it. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2857.04s)]
*  And then the intro, they want to get a video of it and then they keep their phone out. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2858.24s)]
*  And I think that, yeah, I would be, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2861.92s)]
*  it's like being obedient almost with your parents. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2864.8s)]
*  It's like, if you trust your parents, have your best interests at heart. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2866.5600000000004s)]
*  Okay, you're going to listen to them a little bit more. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2868.96s)]
*  And I think they had that relation. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2871.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2872.5600000000004s)]
*  That's kind of cool. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2872.8s)]
*  Yeah, we're hanging out with these Dutch guys and they said that when they came to America, [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2873.76s)]
*  they spent some time driving around the Midwest and stuff. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2877.1200000000003s)]
*  The thing that they just saw everyone thought was so funny is this phrase, it's the law. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2880.2400000000002s)]
*  They would say to them over and over, it's the law. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2884.0800000000004s)]
*  Buckle up. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2886.0800000000004s)]
*  It's the law. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2886.7200000000003s)]
*  Don't text and drive. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2887.6000000000004s)]
*  It's the law. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2888.48s)]
*  And they're like, there's this reinforcement of the law, [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2889.36s)]
*  but yet Americans love to break the rules. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2891.92s)]
*  Whereas in Amsterdam or Europe or in the Netherlands, [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2893.92s)]
*  everything's kind of legal and when there are rules, everyone follows them. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2897.84s)]
*  So it's like sort of the opposite. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2901.52s)]
*  Because you can do pretty much anything. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2902.0s)]
*  So when we say don't do it, don't fucking do it. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2904.08s)]
*  It must be bad. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2907.52s)]
*  Yeah, they're looking out for me. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2908.56s)]
*  Whereas here, we love breaking rules. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2909.6s)]
*  I always thought, and this is probably part of it, but I always thought America, [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2911.12s)]
*  it just glorified rebellion because that's how our country was founded. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2914.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2917.52s)]
*  So rebellion is like, and it should, in that case, it should be, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2918.0s)]
*  but it's a beautiful thing to rebel against. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2920.56s)]
*  It's all kind of just baked into it. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2923.04s)]
*  Also, everybody here rebelled. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2924.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2925.92s)]
*  Like every immigrant class that came, it's a rebellion against something. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2926.24s)]
*  They're like leaving their whole family. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2928.64s)]
*  It's like in our DNA to rebel. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2930.0s)]
*  To fight back, to push back, to antagonize, it's just who we are. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2932.24s)]
*  Like the family members that didn't come here are the ones that got along with the system. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2935.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2940.72s)]
*  The system says I should do this, I'm going to do this. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2941.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2942.96s)]
*  So yeah, just culturally seeing that was cool. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2943.44s)]
*  And then going, one place that was really interesting was Ireland, Dublin. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2946.7999999999997s)]
*  First show we did, amazing venue. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2952.96s)]
*  I mean, unbelievable. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2954.96s)]
*  I've never been in a venue that big that had that incredible acoustics. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2956.72s)]
*  Really? [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2960.64s)]
*  Usually you get into these venues where you got fucking 7,000 people, there's a little echo. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2961.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2964.7999999999997s)]
*  This was almost none. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2965.2799999999997s)]
*  Really? [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2967.2s)]
*  And I don't know how the fuck they did it, but it was amazing. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2967.68s)]
*  But the entire time we're in Dublin, we're asking people, what should we see? [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2969.84s)]
*  What should we see? [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2972.88s)]
*  Not a single person gave a suggestion of anything to say. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2973.68s)]
*  The entire time, not a single person. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2976.64s)]
*  They all just go. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2978.16s)]
*  The spire, you go see the spire. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2978.72s)]
*  Yeah, there's like this chopstick that's in the middle of town, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2979.92s)]
*  and people go. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2981.92s)]
*  And then there's like a Trinity College or something, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2983.2000000000003s)]
*  some college that looks like any other fucking. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2985.36s)]
*  The oldest book, go see the oldest book, it's over in the library. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2987.12s)]
*  Literally, they have no clue what to do, but they all say go out to the pubs. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2990.32s)]
*  And we're like, what are we going to do? [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2993.28s)]
*  We're going to have some fucking Guinness, go out to the pubs. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2994.64s)]
*  Go out to the pubs. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2997.52s)]
*  Fire. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2998.96s)]
*  We went to some pub, I forget the name of it, there's two guys playing guitar, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=2999.76s)]
*  and people are in the pub. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3004.0s)]
*  And the Irish, they need the drink to open up, to bloom a little bit. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3005.52s)]
*  But once they have it in, during the day, they're kind of reserved, [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3010.64s)]
*  they're a little bit kind of quiet, they're removed. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3013.12s)]
*  When the drink gets in them, it's the lower deck of the Titanic. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3016.08s)]
*  I mean, they are singing, dancing. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3021.92s)]
*  I love you, affectionate. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3024.72s)]
*  It is a beautiful thing. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3026.8799999999997s)]
*  And once you experience that, and that's just one pub. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3028.56s)]
*  There's 100 pubs in the city, they're all doing that. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3031.92s)]
*  We're singing every fucking song together, arm in arm, having this amazing time. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3034.08s)]
*  And once you realize that that's what exists there, [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3038.08s)]
*  you don't need other dumb shit. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3040.56s)]
*  Recover during the day, do whatever you need, [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3042.88s)]
*  because once you guys hit the bar and that music starts, [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3044.56s)]
*  and they're like a musical fucking people, they're like going after it. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3047.36s)]
*  And I would say I was like, maybe that was our most fun night. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3050.24s)]
*  Really? [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3054.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3054.56s)]
*  That's why they do the Irish goodbye, because the love is wearing off. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3054.88s)]
*  I gotta get out of here before I mean again. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3058.7999999999997s)]
*  Or they just forget you said bye to them. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3060.88s)]
*  That motherfucker didn't even say bye, [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3063.2s)]
*  and he without saying bye, no, he said bye, you're too drunk. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3064.56s)]
*  Dude, we got in a fight and then I kissed you and I left. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3066.48s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3068.88s)]
*  I know. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3070.1600000000003s)]
*  Bro, that, yeah, it was that or London, we went to the box and that was crazy. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3070.96s)]
*  I almost wish Derek was here to tell this story. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3076.48s)]
*  But like, you know the box, have you heard of this venue? [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3078.6400000000003s)]
*  So the box that we have one in New York, I think the original one is in London. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3081.04s)]
*  It's basically this like, [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3084.08s)]
*  Like cabaret. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3086.32s)]
*  Like avant-garde, provocative type of performance, right? [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3087.6800000000003s)]
*  The idea is to be as provocative as possible with performance arts. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3091.2000000000003s)]
*  It starts at two in the morning. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3095.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, yeah, it would be like a kind of one of these like very difficult to get into, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3097.04s)]
*  can't have your phone out, like vibes. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3102.0800000000004s)]
*  And so we go to an after party for the show and then we go to the box afterwards. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3105.2000000000003s)]
*  And we walk in and there's a guy on stage dressed as a homeless dude. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3109.52s)]
*  And he's shitting into a silver pan. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3116.32s)]
*  Oh, he's naked, by the way. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3120.6400000000003s)]
*  Oh, yeah, naked, shitting into a silver pan. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3121.6000000000004s)]
*  So there's shit coming out of his asshole. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3123.84s)]
*  He's bending over, shitting into the pan, then he grabs, say again? [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3125.44s)]
*  Big meat? [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3128.88s)]
*  Meat was regs. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3130.0s)]
*  Long balls. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3131.12s)]
*  He's got fake tits. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3131.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah, he had fake tits too. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3133.04s)]
*  Yeah, but real attached. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3134.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, they're like breast implants. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3136.48s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3138.56s)]
*  Dick and shitting into this pan. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3139.28s)]
*  Then he grabs the shit and starts to rub it all over his dick and genitals. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3141.28s)]
*  And I think he even throws some of it at the crowd. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3145.2000000000003s)]
*  That's a fight right there. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3148.48s)]
*  That's good for the brain. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3149.68s)]
*  Well, so anyway, we're watching this, right? [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3150.48s)]
*  And we're watching Derek, and Derek is looking at this, and he's like, [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3155.12s)]
*  what the fuck is going on? [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3158.3199999999997s)]
*  Where did you guys bring me? [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3159.9199999999996s)]
*  No, no, you would think, but he's like shocked and going, is everything OK? [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3162.16s)]
*  And none of us realize it, but earlier, a trans woman, a gigantic fucking linebacker trans woman, [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3165.6s)]
*  walks up to him and just grabs his dick. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3172.72s)]
*  And Derek is like, what the fuck did you just, no, he is not OK. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3175.68s)]
*  Yeah, he was like, he's like, you're acting like a man right now. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3180.4799999999996s)]
*  Only a man would do that. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3183.12s)]
*  I thought he'd be in heaven with that shit. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3185.04s)]
*  No, no. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3186.56s)]
*  He's got dicks and tits. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3186.7999999999997s)]
*  So, but keep in mind, so in his, I thought she knew him. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3187.92s)]
*  I thought she knew him. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3193.8399999999997s)]

*  I thought she was giving him a moment, but none of us knew that that happened. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3196.96s)]
*  We just saw him really disheveled in this environment. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3200.0s)]
*  And I'm assuming it's because he's watching the guy shitting the pan for the first time [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3202.48s)]
*  and running around in his genitals with fake tits, which is a pretty reasonable reaction. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3205.3599999999997s)]

*  Oh no. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3218.8s)]
*  And he's like, I don't want to beat the shit out of this girl and ruin the after party for [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3219.1200000000003s)]
*  everybody, but right now I'm fucking freaking out right now. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3223.92s)]

*  And to recover, there's another trans rubbing shit all over his dick on the stage. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3231.6000000000004s)]

*  They're trying to act weird. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3245.12s)]
*  And he thinks I'm talking about grabbing the dick. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3246.48s)]
*  But I'm talking about the man shitting in the pan, right? [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3248.64s)]

*  I was like, you can't be the white girl offended. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3260.16s)]
*  And he's like, this man bitch grabbed my dick. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3262.16s)]
*  He's not saying it. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3266.7999999999997s)]

*  But when they fight, they're like, hey, let's just pwned each other and then let's go eat after. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3511.7599999999998s)]

*  There are these two guys that came to the show earlier that's in this place. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3529.8399999999997s)]
*  It's like this deli at four in the morning. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3532.88s)]
*  We're all eating. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3534.56s)]
*  We're all tired, kind of drunk, just eating food. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3535.12s)]
*  And then this dude walks in. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3537.12s)]
*  I think he's Scottish or something? [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3538.08s)]
*  No, no. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3539.68s)]
*  He's from England. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3540.08s)]
*  He is? [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3542.4s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3542.88s)]
*  And so then he walks in and he's just talking shit. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3543.44s)]
*  He walks in and we're all joking with him, making fun of him because it's raining. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3546.4s)]
*  Everyone's soaked. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3549.3599999999997s)]
*  And then he starts talking to one of the guys at the booth. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3550.24s)]
*  And the guy at the booth, they start jawing at each other. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3552.3199999999997s)]
*  And then the guy at the booth stands up and he's like, yeah, punch me. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3554.96s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, I will punch you motherfucker. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3557.12s)]
*  And they just start yelling at each other. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3558.56s)]
*  And then she's almost like, just sit down. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3560.0s)]
*  And then both of them are like, that's a better idea. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3561.68s)]
*  And then they both sit down and then they all just eat together. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3564.8s)]
*  We also love bomb the guy. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3567.68s)]
*  The guy needed a little bit of love. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3568.88s)]
*  He had like a chip on his shoulder and then we just started love bombing him. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3570.2400000000002s)]
*  We were like, Patrick, Patrick, Patrick, we love Patrick. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3573.36s)]
*  And he was like, oh, oh, let's get some bread. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3577.84s)]
*  He grabbed his dick and took it. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3580.4s)]
*  From one minute to be like, yo, we're going to fight in this deli. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3584.0s)]
*  If someone threw a punch, it was on to then just eating beans together. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3586.88s)]
*  Two seconds. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3590.2400000000002s)]
*  That is kind of nice. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3591.6000000000004s)]
*  I think we get this different version of British people where we get the Hugh Grant version. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3593.84s)]
*  So we expect they're all these mumbling pussies. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3598.48s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3602.88s)]
*  Nobody is afraid of Hugh Grant. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3603.76s)]
*  Hugh Grant is a bitch for all intents and purposes. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3605.6000000000004s)]
*  That's what his character has always been. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3609.0400000000004s)]
*  I'm talking shit after he leaves. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3610.6400000000003s)]
*  Who, who, who, who? [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3613.12s)]
*  Hugh Grant. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3614.16s)]
*  No, Hugh Grant knows. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3614.72s)]
*  That's the way he's been playing it. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3616.3199999999997s)]
*  Your perception of the British is they are like him, but they're not. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3617.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3620.72s)]
*  I remember the first time I saw Guy Ritchie movie, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Mirrors. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3620.8799999999997s)]
*  I was like, this is England? [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3623.92s)]
*  That's more of England than Hugh Grant. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3625.44s)]
*  Hugh Grant is kind of like the royal idea. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3628.56s)]
*  Like, let's be elegant and simple and have our feelings and be unaware and unsure of ourselves. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3633.3599999999997s)]
*  And the majority of England is like, so you want to fight about this or what? [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3640.24s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3645.9199999999996s)]
*  Like, I don't like your soccer team. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3646.4799999999996s)]
*  You know, like, you want to just fight, maybe we'll stab each other a little bit. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3648.0s)]
*  And then if we live, then we'll do it again next week. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3650.7999999999997s)]
*  When you leave London, you're like, oh, I see how you guys voted for Brexit. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3652.8799999999997s)]
*  Okay, I understand what's going on here. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3656.24s)]
*  I get it. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3658.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I'm surprised they don't vote to further Brexit. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3659.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3662.3999999999996s)]
*  Like, each one of the little areas wants to, wants to Brexit. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3663.04s)]
*  Like, yeah, it's, it's, it's amazing it's kept together. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3665.7599999999998s)]
*  Actually, shout out the crown. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3668.88s)]
*  Shout out the royal family. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3671.92s)]
*  Holding all these guys together is quite impressive. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3672.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3675.52s)]
*  Like, that's a good feat because they're not all on board. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3676.0s)]
*  No, they can't hold their family together. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3679.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3681.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3683.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3684.6400000000003s)]
*  But yeah, yeah, yeah, there's a lot of dissent, put it that way. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3685.28s)]
*  Yeah, it was fun though. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3689.2000000000003s)]
*  It was fun. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3690.8s)]
*  You farted in the, in the lounge and it created a scene. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3691.2000000000003s)]
*  Do you remember that? [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3693.76s)]
*  Yeah, the Indians got all excited, dude. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3694.7200000000003s)]
*  Dude, right as we were leaving, you know how we just farts often? [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3696.4s)]
*  Most of the time he farts and no one says anything. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3700.56s)]
*  But then we were raised, we were leaving, bro. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3702.2400000000002s)]
*  We were in Abu Dhabi, we were sitting in this tiny lounge and he just goes, uh-oh. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3703.76s)]
*  And we all just look at him and it's just, just the loudest fart. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3707.84s)]
*  All of us walk away and then literally some dude from across the thing goes, [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3711.36s)]
*  hey, that's pretty gross. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3714.64s)]
*  You got a picking and flicking situation. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3717.52s)]
*  I did, I did, I did, but I didn't care. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3718.96s)]
*  I leaned the fuck into that. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3720.48s)]
*  But then it became like a convo. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3721.04s)]
*  You guys were like talking about it. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3722.2400000000002s)]
*  You're like, yeah, I do my stomach hurts. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3723.44s)]
*  It is what it is, bro. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3726.64s)]
*  It created a moment. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3727.28s)]
*  I had never seen that before. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3728.08s)]
*  My stomach wasn't ready, bro. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3729.28s)]
*  It wasn't fucking ready. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3731.28s)]
*  What did that guy say? [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3732.08s)]
*  Do you remember? [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3732.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3733.44s)]
*  I thought he liked it though. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3733.76s)]
*  The Indian dude, the old Indian. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3734.64s)]
*  Bro, nobody milks wheelchairs on a plane like fucking Indians, bro. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3736.08s)]
*  And it's goddamn annoying. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3739.2000000000003s)]
*  It takes twice as long to get on a fucking airplane if there's Indians there [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3741.28s)]
*  because every Indian over 45 pretends they're 300 years old [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3744.32s)]
*  and they get in a stupid fucking wheelchair. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3749.28s)]
*  And then like when they have to get out, they exaggerate how slow they have to. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3751.44s)]
*  Like I've never walked before. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3756.08s)]
*  They're 80, dude. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3757.44s)]
*  They just look young because they don't age like white people. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3758.4s)]
*  No, no, they look like shit. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3760.4s)]
*  They look bad. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3761.84s)]
*  They're old. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3763.12s)]
*  No, they look bad. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3763.84s)]
*  But like they're 100 years old. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3764.8s)]
*  All of them, I bet. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3766.56s)]
*  So they are old. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3768.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3768.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3769.6s)]
*  That's what I was saying. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3769.84s)]
*  You said every Indian that's 45 gets in a wheelchair. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3771.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm telling you they're old. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3773.76s)]
*  Oh, god. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3774.64s)]
*  They are 100. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3775.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3776.56s)]
*  Gotcha. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3776.96s)]
*  Gotcha. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3777.36s)]
*  Gotcha. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3777.6s)]
*  Now, but they're doing the old Disney World trick. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3778.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's what they're milking it, dude. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3780.0s)]
*  They're fucking milking it. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3782.08s)]
*  You don't see that even here in the States. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3783.28s)]
*  The best is that they were doing it and Andrew is just seeing like six of them go and unload. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3785.44s)]
*  The best part is they unloaded and so the people that are walking in wheelchairs are now coming [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3791.2000000000003s)]
*  off the sky bridge except then one person behind Andrew, like an old Indian lady, [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3795.6800000000003s)]
*  gets into the wheelchair and turns around to cut Andrew. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3800.88s)]
*  What a hero, dude. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3804.32s)]

*  They don't wear deodorant. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3921.12s)]
*  Why not? [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3922.32s)]
*  They're the first hipsters, right? [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3925.28s)]
*  No, but I think it's because we've [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3926.7200000000003s)]
*  go to Brooklyn. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3928.4s)]
*  They all smell like that. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3929.12s)]
*  No, no, but we've been limited in our abilities [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3930.2400000000002s)]
*  because bullying people is how you kind of get them to assimilate, right? [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3932.8s)]
*  Like you bully them a little bit and then they kind of get on board [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3935.92s)]
*  because they understand like what they're doing is different from [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3938.8s)]
*  whatever the dominant culture is. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3941.6800000000003s)]

*  It's working, bro. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3945.36s)]
*  Dominant culture. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3946.1600000000003s)]
*  This is the dominant culture. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3947.36s)]
*  Okay. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3948.7200000000003s)]
*  They try to make them wear deodorant. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3949.04s)]
*  They invented the brand. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3951.12s)]
*  What is it? [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3952.4s)]
*  Old Spice. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3952.88s)]
*  They were like, dude, these people love spices. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3953.52s)]
*  Let's make a company. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3955.6s)]
*  Still didn't work. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3956.64s)]
*  The Old Spice is the worst. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3958.88s)]
*  I mean, unbelievable, dude. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3960.48s)]
*  I just could not. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3963.12s)]
*  We need to do something about it. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3965.04s)]
*  I think it'll change over time. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3966.96s)]
*  I think actual issue is infrastructure. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3968.2400000000002s)]
*  There's not like supermarkets with deodorant on every whatever. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3970.4s)]
*  So as infrastructure improves, more and more people. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3973.76s)]
*  Do we sponsor someone? [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3976.0s)]
*  But we were in the United Arab Emirates. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3977.36s)]
*  Yes, so just culturally it becomes not. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3979.04s)]
*  You just don't wear it. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3980.64s)]
*  Okay. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3981.52s)]
*  And I remember Richard Pryor had a joke where they think, [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3981.84s)]
*  and he went to Africa and he was like, [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3984.96s)]
*  they think we smell weird with all the deodorant shit. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3986.96s)]
*  So he's like, but that's a joke. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3989.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3991.28s)]
*  He said, but he said, that's not true. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3991.78s)]
*  That is a lie. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3994.48s)]
*  That is a lie. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3995.28s)]
*  He said he emotionally truth that whole thing. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3996.32s)]
*  I think he emotionally, that's an emotional truth. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=3998.96s)]
*  I think it's an emotional truth. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4000.8s)]
*  That is an emotional truth. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4001.76s)]
*  I think there's a seed of truth. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4002.8s)]
*  I think it's the honor of. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4004.08s)]
*  70% is the smell. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4007.92s)]
*  This happened to me. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4010.48s)]
*  I smelled this thing. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4011.28s)]
*  No, because I don't think Africans smell or Indians smell like a rose and they're like, [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4012.16s)]
*  I think they go, oh, that's a beautiful smell. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4016.8799999999997s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4018.96s)]

*  Okay. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4022.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, yeah, all these things are based on fragrances, right? [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4023.44s)]
*  Like the nose knows what smells well. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4025.92s)]
*  I think they smell like a flower and they go, oh, disgusting. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4027.92s)]
*  I don't think they do. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4030.3199999999997s)]
*  Maybe I think they go, this smells great. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4031.04s)]
*  Yes. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4032.7999999999997s)]
*  Maybe it smells fake to them. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4032.96s)]
*  To them, it's like when people who put on too much cologne or perfume. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4034.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4038.56s)]

*  And you probably need a whitening or whatever. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4807.6s)]
*  You really got to tell her no. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4809.12s)]
*  They got me. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4810.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4811.04s)]
*  Always Latinas. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4812.08s)]
*  That's why I hate strip clubs, right? [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4812.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4814.0s)]
*  God damn, I always walk out a lot poorer than when I walk out. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4814.64s)]
*  Make eye contact the whole time. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4818.64s)]
*  She's like, spit here, Poppy. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4820.16s)]
*  Just look at her. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4821.36s)]
*  I was like, oh, she's feeling. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4822.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4823.44s)]
*  Why'd she ask me to sit here? [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4824.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4825.44s)]
*  What else we got going on, Martin? [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4826.8s)]
*  We got some feelings on fact? [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4828.639999999999s)]
*  We've got a bunch of random things, all right? [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4829.76s)]
*  I feel no facts. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4831.12s)]
*  Jon Stewart's show got canceled. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4831.84s)]
*  The problem with Jon Stewart. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4833.76s)]
*  Apple canceled it apparently because of some of the content related to AI in China. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4835.599999999999s)]
*  So what I heard is- [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4842.32s)]
*  I have to W for Jon Stewart. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4843.679999999999s)]
*  Jon Stewart is a fucking goat, by the way. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4844.16s)]
*  He's an absolute goat. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4845.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4847.12s)]
*  What I heard is he was okay with them asking him not to criticize China [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4847.76s)]
*  because he's like, all right, I get it, fine. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4851.68s)]
*  A lot of your products are made over there. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4853.4400000000005s)]
*  It's a spiteful government. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4854.96s)]
*  Whatever. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4856.08s)]
*  I get it. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4856.64s)]
*  I'll pull back on that. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4857.12s)]
*  Then when they asked about the AI criticism, he was like, you know what? [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4858.4800000000005s)]
*  Fuck you. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4861.04s)]
*  I don't need this. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4861.4400000000005s)]
*  You're not going to sit here and police my material. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4862.240000000001s)]
*  That's just not happening. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4864.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4865.04s)]
*  Wow. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4865.4400000000005s)]
*  Fish is so fired, dude. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4865.92s)]
*  Yeah, I love that. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4867.52s)]
*  I get him not doing the China piece because he's agreeing to do a show on Apple. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4869.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4877.6s)]
*  So it's like if you know that you're in bed with- [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4878.08s)]
*  Apple was in bed with China. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4881.5199999999995s)]
*  So are you really going to be critical of them? [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4883.04s)]
*  You're supporting the brand. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4885.76s)]
*  You're building the brand. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4886.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4887.84s)]
*  Right? [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4888.24s)]
*  So I get him going, all right, I could potentially be hypocritical. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4888.8s)]
*  Which is also so cool of him to have that self-awareness and be like, [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4891.84s)]
*  I'm going to give you that one. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4894.639999999999s)]
*  Apple, all right. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4895.44s)]
*  I'm going to give you that one. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4896.08s)]
*  Done. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4896.88s)]
*  Who am I? [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4897.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4897.92s)]
*  But then Jon Stewart's in the I don't need your money land. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4898.16s)]
*  He's got fucking money. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4903.28s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4904.16s)]
*  But there's a lot of people in that land that still take the money. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4904.639999999999s)]
*  And I don't judge them because I could end up being one of them if I had that kind of money. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4906.96s)]
*  Yes. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4910.08s)]
*  But Jon Stewart to truly be like, now this is my ethic and I'm not going to fuck with that, I'm out. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4910.48s)]
*  Now question- [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4915.759999999999s)]
*  The details of the AI story? [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4916.5599999999995s)]
*  No, I don't know. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4918.48s)]
*  Was it something he did do or something that he wanted to do? [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4919.5199999999995s)]
*  I think he wanted to do it. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4922.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4923.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4924.0s)]
*  Now here's the question. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4924.4s)]
*  I'm sure Jon Stewart is the most caring dude. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4925.5199999999995s)]
*  He's dedicated his post-Daily Show career to getting health care to the firefighters that were [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4928.32s)]
*  affected by Natalya. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4934.0s)]
*  This guy clearly cares about people. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4934.959999999999s)]
*  The burn pits thing he talked about on his show. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4936.799999999999s)]
*  He's the man. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4938.799999999999s)]
*  Now I wonder how difficult it was for him to stop the show knowing that there are probably [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4939.6s)]
*  all these people working for the show that depend on it. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4944.96s)]
*  I wonder if he's like, I can't be censored and just become like a propaganda arm for Apple. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4948.8s)]
*  But at the same time, there are all these people I fucking really love and believe in [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4954.96s)]
*  that rely on this. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4959.360000000001s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4960.4800000000005s)]
*  But I think it's going to be a crazy bidding war for that show. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4961.280000000001s)]
*  Oh, so you're saying the show won't stop. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4963.84s)]
*  It will just go somewhere else. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4965.76s)]
*  Somewhere. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4967.04s)]
*  It's like, hey, we'll let you say whatever you want. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4967.52s)]
*  Netflix, now's your time, bro. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4969.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4971.36s)]
*  Netflix, now is your time. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4971.92s)]
*  I mean, look at Jon Oliver. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4974.72s)]
*  Yeah, kills. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4978.400000000001s)]
*  He's with HBO. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4979.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4979.84s)]
*  And they gave him so much more money. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4980.400000000001s)]
*  It's on YouTube. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4981.68s)]
*  But you can watch all of it for free. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4982.32s)]
*  Yep. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4983.84s)]
*  Like, yeah. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4984.56s)]
*  I mean, if I'm Netflix, I go, OK, let's compete with HBO. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4985.2s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4988.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4988.96s)]
*  Put it on YouTube. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4989.2s)]
*  Get the money. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4990.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4991.04s)]
*  Also another cool story about Jon. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4991.28s)]
*  One of our friends wrote for him on another project that he, Jon, decided not to move [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4992.56s)]
*  forward with. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4995.84s)]
*  It was supposed to be like an animation thing and the technology wasn't there. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4996.24s)]
*  He thought about his employees and then he just paid them out for an extra like, [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=4998.96s)]
*  it was like way more than what the standard is. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5003.04s)]
*  Like, here, you guys, this will give you time to figure out what you want to do. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5004.88s)]
*  He just paid them. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5008.32s)]
*  So like, he's the fucking goat. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5009.2s)]
*  What I was wondering, you know who still needs a host for their show? [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5010.96s)]
*  The Daily Show. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5014.8s)]
*  Does he come back? [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5016.08s)]
*  Oh, imagine. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5017.12s)]
*  I mean, yeah. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5018.64s)]
*  Even if he guest hosted for a month, it'd be the craziest. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5020.400000000001s)]
*  The Daily Show needs him really, really bad. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5023.76s)]
*  That would be awesome. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5025.76s)]
*  That would be so fucking cool. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5026.96s)]
*  And then immediately reestablishes it as the brand that it used to be. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5028.8s)]
*  Yes. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5032.88s)]
*  That would be so fucking cool. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5033.68s)]
*  Daily Show, get on it. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5036.320000000001s)]
*  Or if he runs for president. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5037.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5039.360000000001s)]
*  That's my vote. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5039.92s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5040.72s)]
*  A thousand percent. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5041.2s)]
*  I don't think he wants to do politics because he can't. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5042.08s)]
*  He probably feels like he can't be the honest, good person that he is. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5045.68s)]
*  I feel like, you know, that's part, that speaks to his character, [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5048.88s)]
*  but he goes to Washington and he speaks like he's trying to change. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5052.0s)]
*  He's political. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5057.36s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5058.16s)]
*  That'd be interesting. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5059.12s)]
*  Okay, what else we got? [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5060.72s)]
*  Michael Irvin called that his rapper son. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5061.68s)]
*  I love it. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5063.6s)]
*  You see this? [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5064.16s)]
*  Such a funny claim. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5064.72s)]
*  Michael Irvin's the man. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5065.36s)]
*  We need him back, dude. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5066.96s)]
*  Yeah, Michael Irvin. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5068.0s)]
*  Are we letting him play, you think? [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5068.72s)]
*  You think we'll get a clip for it? [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5070.48s)]
*  Is it ESPN? [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5071.52s)]
*  Then yes. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5072.4s)]
*  Basically, just describe it. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5073.36s)]
*  He goes, my son is rapping all this nonsense. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5074.72s)]
*  You grew up in a gated community. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5078.4s)]
*  He says his name. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5079.6s)]
*  He goes, my son is a rapper. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5080.24s)]
*  Tarantino. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5081.84s)]
*  So you out the guy immediately. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5082.72s)]
*  You can't even hide behind it. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5084.08s)]
*  He's like, he's rapping about all these things, lies. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5085.4400000000005s)]
*  He just said he grew up in a gated community. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5087.360000000001s)]
*  You rapping about my life. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5089.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5090.72s)]
*  So fucking art and fire. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5091.6s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5094.320000000001s)]
*  And Michael Irvin's a legend. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5094.8s)]
*  All my... [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5095.6s)]
*  Shitty father, though. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5096.160000000001s)]
*  That's what I'm... [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5097.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5097.6s)]
*  My thing is like, come on, Mike. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5098.400000000001s)]
*  Let him eat. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5099.76s)]
*  Nobody can eat but you. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5100.4800000000005s)]
*  Also, like, talk to him. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5102.240000000001s)]
*  You got his number? [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5103.68s)]
*  Give him a call. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5104.4800000000005s)]
*  You don't got to do it on national television, bro. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5105.360000000001s)]
*  Then I saw a clip of a couple of his son's music videos. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5107.280000000001s)]
*  All in the big mansion. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5111.68s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5112.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5113.68s)]
*  I'm just trying to eat breakfast. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5116.08s)]
*  I got to maneuver the fucking cameras. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5117.280000000001s)]
*  You crazy? [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5119.200000000001s)]
*  That's funny. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5120.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, that was fucked up, bro. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5121.280000000001s)]
*  That's funny. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5122.56s)]
*  What's this? [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5123.120000000001s)]
*  What's this Britney story? [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5123.84s)]
*  Yeah, all this Britney Spears drama is all of a sudden dropping right now. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5125.120000000001s)]
*  She got a book coming out. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5128.08s)]
*  So these are excerpts from the book. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5129.4400000000005s)]
*  And apparently they're not making Justin look great. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5131.92s)]
*  So she's basically... [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5134.88s)]
*  Apparently she said... [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5136.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't know if... [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5138.400000000001s)]
*  I saw this on Twitter. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5139.04s)]
*  I know she said he had a small penis. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5139.76s)]
*  But I think the first... [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5140.96s)]
*  The excerpt from the tweet I saw was the first time they had sex. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5142.4800000000005s)]
*  She said, you can put it in now. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5145.84s)]
*  And he was like, it already is in. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5147.28s)]
*  Is that real? [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5149.04s)]
*  I don't know if that's real. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5150.24s)]
*  Is that possible? [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5151.44s)]
*  It's really funny. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5151.76s)]
*  It's really funny. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5153.76s)]
*  This bitch is crazy, bro. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5154.56s)]
*  Nah, free Britney. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5155.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5156.72s)]
*  Lock that bitch up, bro. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5159.44s)]
*  It's crazy that people are still making money off of her. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5161.76s)]
*  That's what's crazy. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5163.92s)]
*  This girl is absolutely out of her mind and they're signing book deals. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5165.28s)]
*  They're like agents and people maneuvering behind the scenes. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5168.96s)]
*  The pimpin' never ends, bro. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5172.4800000000005s)]
*  Yo, it's fucking insane. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5173.52s)]
*  They're still neat. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5175.4400000000005s)]
*  They gonna eat. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5176.88s)]
*  Now she's off the conservatorship, right? [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5177.84s)]
*  So yeah, it's her money. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5180.320000000001s)]
*  So they could take even more money. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5181.6s)]
*  But she gets the money, at least. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5182.96s)]
*  Hopefully. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5185.52s)]
*  Or does the agent and the lawyer and all these other people siphon it all out, [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5186.160000000001s)]
*  make sure her bills are paid. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5189.4400000000005s)]
*  This feels like some Elvis shit. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5191.12s)]
*  Y'all seen the Elvis movie with the homeboy in it? [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5192.320000000001s)]
*  Major something or something like that. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5195.92s)]
*  What is his name? [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5197.280000000001s)]
*  His manager that took half of his money. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5197.84s)]
*  50% was his money. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5199.6s)]
*  Yeah, but just treat him like a dairy cow. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5200.4800000000005s)]
*  You live here, you perform here, you don't gotta go anywhere else. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5202.64s)]
*  And I feel like that's what they're doing, a dairy cow. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5205.92s)]
*  That's quite a bit of musicians. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5207.84s)]
*  100%. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5210.24s)]
*  But once you know that she's out of her mind, it just feels worse. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5211.04s)]
*  If you're a sane person and you're being taken advantage of, it's fucked up. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5214.88s)]
*  But there's part of you that's going, I really want this fame. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5219.68s)]
*  I really want all these other things. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5221.68s)]
*  So if you're sane, if you're aware of it, [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5222.96s)]
*  you are allowing it because you're aware of it. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5226.96s)]
*  There are people who get stolen from them that don't know. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5228.400000000001s)]
*  That's fucked up. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5230.0s)]
*  But this girl's out of her mind. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5231.12s)]
*  There's two- [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5233.92s)]
*  She's dancing with the knives and shit. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5234.24s)]
*  There's two stories about Jess and let me know what you think of them. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5235.84s)]
*  One is he actually cheated on her twice before she cheated, [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5239.04s)]
*  and then he came out with Cry Me a River. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5244.88s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5246.400000000001s)]
*  Shut up, bitch. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5247.28s)]
*  Who are you talking about? [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5249.28s)]
*  Nah. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5250.08s)]
*  I don't even know. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5250.8s)]
*  Who is that bitch for? [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5251.84s)]
*  I was on your side once. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5254.0s)]
*  Nah, I was on your side for a second, but you just now going to come out with that shit. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5257.2s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5260.5599999999995s)]
*  Because she was looking bad when that whole Cry Me a River shit, [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5261.679999999999s)]
*  and she never once mentioned that he cheated on her first. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5265.36s)]
*  So now you're going to come out 20 years later and say this shit? [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5267.84s)]
*  Fuck that. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5270.24s)]
*  So you don't believe it? [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5271.76s)]
*  I don't believe it. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5272.88s)]
*  Okay. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5273.5199999999995s)]
*  How old were they when they dated? [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5273.84s)]
*  Lock that bitch up. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5274.8s)]
*  How old were they when they dated? [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5276.96s)]
*  They were like 20? [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5277.92s)]
*  No, 17 and 18. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5278.719999999999s)]
*  They started. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5279.76s)]
*  Bro, these are children that are being stupid. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5280.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5283.04s)]
*  They had America in a chokehold, this couple. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5284.64s)]

*  That's a great point. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5943.84s)]
*  Optional 65, 80 is like it's in the soup. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5944.32s)]
*  You got to poison the water, bro. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5947.2s)]
*  You're starting microdosing at 80. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5948.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5950.16s)]

*  Yeah, run it up. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5958.4s)]
*  Yeah, maybe that's a great idea. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5959.2s)]
*  Shit. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5960.88s)]
*  You can't do it before that. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5961.679999999999s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5962.5599999999995s)]
*  That's illegal. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5963.04s)]
*  You got too much to live for. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5964.24s)]
*  70, though. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5965.44s)]
*  Prostitution, legal. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5966.5599999999995s)]
*  You can get it. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5968.24s)]
*  You can give it. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5968.88s)]
*  That's fire. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5970.4s)]
*  Sell that box at 70, huh? [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5971.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5973.2s)]
*  Set your own price. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5973.92s)]
*  Whatever you want, dude. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5974.72s)]
*  70 is a different country. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5976.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5977.2s)]
*  70 is a different country. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5977.76s)]
*  We're solving something here. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5979.28s)]
*  I kind of do like taking care of old people in that way. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5980.08s)]
*  Yeah, you're trying to get dicked down. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5983.52s)]
*  Easy. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5985.76s)]
*  70. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5986.48s)]
*  Do we make, do we, how do I phrase this? [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5986.8s)]
*  We do national service at 18. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5990.32s)]
*  You have to enlist and you can go fuck the old people. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5991.84s)]
*  Well, yeah, but maybe that's a way to get out of jail time. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5993.84s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5997.36s)]
*  Also that. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5998.08s)]
*  So it's like if you're locked up for like a DUI or something. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=5998.8s)]
*  Yeah, you got a year or you can take a plea deal. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6001.84s)]
*  Suck off an old guy. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6003.84s)]
*  That's exactly what happened. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6006.4s)]
*  What were you thinking? [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6007.36s)]
*  That's just prison. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6009.52s)]
*  That's just already prison. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6010.4s)]
*  But not an old guy. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6011.92s)]
*  It's usually like a young viral guy. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6014.16s)]
*  Who will fuck your ass? [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6015.76s)]
*  You just suck this guy's dick. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6017.68s)]
*  I'm saying the women that get locked up. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6019.28s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6021.12s)]
*  And they could basically get a lower jail sentence [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6021.84s)]
*  by sucking off an old guy's dick. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6024.72s)]
*  Yep. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6027.68s)]
*  That works. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6028.4s)]
*  That's what I'm saying, dude. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6029.2s)]
*  I think that's a great scenario. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6030.88s)]
*  You made America greater than it's ever been. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6032.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6034.24s)]
*  You can run on that platform. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6035.36s)]
*  You absolutely, because old people vote. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6036.4s)]
*  And if my platform is y'all can do drugs, fuck hoes. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6038.639999999999s)]
*  But then they stop getting to vote. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6042.16s)]
*  Yep. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6044.799999999999s)]
*  I think once they reach a certain age, we got to stop that. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6045.28s)]
*  Because you aren't really invested. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6048.16s)]
*  You're too drugged up too. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6049.759999999999s)]
*  No, not even that. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6050.96s)]
*  You're not invested in the future of this country. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6051.92s)]
*  You just voting for now, shit. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6055.28s)]
*  We need people who are like, yo, it needs to be nice [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6057.679999999999s)]
*  for the next 30, 40, 50 years. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6059.839999999999s)]
*  You can't drive either. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6061.679999999999s)]
*  Talk to me on that. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6063.839999999999s)]
*  You get the drugs, but you also can't drive. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6064.48s)]
*  You're going to be incapacitated. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6066.08s)]
*  But then they have to get. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6067.36s)]
*  Golf cards is fine. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6068.4s)]
*  Golf cards is fine, but they should have an Uber credit [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6068.879999999999s)]
*  that's part of their social welfare system. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6071.759999999999s)]
*  I like that. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6074.0s)]
*  So they have a way to get everywhere they want without us. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6074.5599999999995s)]
*  Because you don't want to have to, they can't drive. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6077.599999999999s)]
*  Now you got to drive their grandma everywhere. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6079.2s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6081.12s)]
*  We got Yusef for that. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6082.16s)]
*  Yeah, he'll drive them around. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6083.5199999999995s)]
*  Yusef? [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6084.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the Uber driver, Yusef. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6085.44s)]
*  That did feel like a little bit racist. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6088.959999999999s)]
*  Right? [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6090.879999999999s)]
*  Racially charged. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6091.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6092.32s)]
*  Wait, why is that racist? [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6092.879999999999s)]
*  I went to school with a Nigerian dude named Yusef. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6093.76s)]
*  He drives Uber now. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6095.360000000001s)]
*  Oh, God. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6096.08s)]

*  Wow. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6097.12s)]

*  Wow, bro. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6098.56s)]
*  Don't do that. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6099.12s)]
*  It's not making any better. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6099.84s)]
*  In Florida. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6100.8s)]
*  What happened, dude? [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6101.360000000001s)]
*  You just won black frame. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6102.0s)]
*  Let's take a break for a second. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6103.52s)]
*  What the hell? [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6104.8s)]
*  Let's take a break for a second. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6105.6s)]
*  What the hell, dude? [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6106.320000000001s)]
*  Come on. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6107.280000000001s)]
*  Give me the peace pipe. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6107.84s)]
*  Shout out Yusef, bro. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6108.320000000001s)]
*  Pass me the peace pipe. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6108.96s)]
*  All right, we're back. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6110.16s)]
*  Let's do it. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6111.360000000001s)]
*  Let's have the conversation. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6111.84s)]
*  Israel-Palestine. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6112.88s)]
*  It's been a little more than two weeks [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6115.2s)]
*  since the terrorist attack by Hamas, October 7th. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6117.12s)]
*  And I know a lot of people have been reaching out, [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6120.8s)]
*  and they're like, hey, when are you going to talk about this? [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6123.12s)]
*  When are you going to talk about this? [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6124.88s)]
*  I learned something in the Russia-Ukraine War, [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6126.08s)]
*  and it confirmed this quote that exists. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6130.0s)]
*  This quote is, when the war starts, the truth dies. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6133.360000000001s)]
*  And I remember at the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine War, [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6136.72s)]
*  there was that great story of the ghost of Kiev. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6139.12s)]
*  And I got emotional watching videos about it. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6142.16s)]
*  I remember almost tearing up about this man that gets in his plane [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6144.4800000000005s)]
*  after not serving in the military for 20 years, [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6148.4s)]
*  and he hits this guy, and he starts taking out these Russian jets, [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6151.04s)]
*  and the news was covering it. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6154.08s)]
*  Every Instagram was covering it. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6155.839999999999s)]
*  There's YouTube stories about it. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6156.96s)]
*  And then a week later, it turns out it's not true. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6158.32s)]
*  And I think that we've learned that when the war starts, [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6161.599999999999s)]
*  the truth ends up dying, at least on our social feeds, [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6166.4s)]
*  over the last few weeks. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6169.36s)]
*  And the reason why I didn't knee-jerk jump to saying, [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6170.5599999999995s)]
*  hey, let's talk about this and give our opinion and stay. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6174.24s)]
*  One, we're obviously fucking comedians. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6177.04s)]
*  We're not gonna solve a geopolitical crisis [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6178.56s)]
*  that's been going on for 70 fucking years. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6180.24s)]
*  But also because we're reacting emotionally to these things [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6182.0s)]
*  that we don't know exactly if they're true or not. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6184.8s)]
*  And I mean, you saw it. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6188.32s)]
*  You even see it with the hospital bombing. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6190.32s)]
*  We, to this day, still don't know exactly what the fuck happened. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6192.0s)]
*  Both sides are obviously claiming the other side. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6195.28s)]
*  Both sides are obviously using tons of propaganda [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6197.04s)]
*  to support their positions. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6199.44s)]
*  And I think that what a lot of people are going through [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6201.28s)]
*  over the last couple of weeks, [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6203.28s)]
*  especially people who are one bit removed from it. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6205.04s)]
*  Like, obviously, if you're Israeli or you're Jewish, [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6211.04s)]
*  you're locked in your passion. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6212.719999999999s)]
*  If you're Palestinian, you're locked in your passion. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6213.679999999999s)]
*  But those of us who aren't either, [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6215.679999999999s)]
*  I think what we've been going through is just like, [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6217.44s)]
*  what the fuck is true? [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6219.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6220.32s)]
*  What the fuck is going on? [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6220.96s)]
*  I'm getting all this information on my feed [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6222.5599999999995s)]
*  and I'm reacting to it. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6224.4s)]
*  And then I'm finding out two hours later, [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6225.28s)]
*  oh, that was actually a picture from Kosovo. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6226.96s)]
*  And you're like, what is happening here? [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6230.0s)]
*  And I think it took some time [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6233.360000000001s)]
*  and I just want to talk to some Jewish friends. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6237.200000000001s)]
*  I want to talk to some Palestinian friends. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6239.120000000001s)]
*  I just want to understand what both groups were feeling. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6240.64s)]
*  I understand now how unbelievably isolating it is [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6246.4800000000005s)]
*  to be both of them in this scenario. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6252.160000000001s)]
*  So let's just take, for example, the Jews, right? [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6254.240000000001s)]
*  You're a Western Jew. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6256.240000000001s)]
*  You've raised your entire life with your history, [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6257.6s)]
*  with the stories of your victimization [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6260.4s)]
*  and your oppression, right? [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6263.04s)]
*  Jews have been kicked out of every single fucking country [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6264.0s)]
*  they've ever been in. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6265.84s)]
*  I mean, literally, you go to a country, [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6266.5599999999995s)]
*  even on this tour, [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6268.4s)]
*  I'd be doing some research of the city we're in [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6269.76s)]
*  and then I just come across the date [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6271.84s)]
*  that the Jews were kicked out. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6273.76s)]
*  And I was like, oh shit, King George did it [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6275.12s)]
*  to the fucking Jews in year 1000 or whatever in England. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6276.8s)]
*  I didn't even know that happened. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6279.5199999999995s)]
*  It like every single country. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6280.4s)]
*  So you're listening to this information. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6282.48s)]
*  You're as a Western Jew, you're hearing about it. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6284.5599999999995s)]
*  Your grandparents, [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6288.08s)]
*  your private grandparents, [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6288.88s)]
*  if I have the Holocaust, 100% tells you about it. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6289.76s)]
*  100%. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6292.0s)]
*  People are gonna try to exterminate us. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6292.72s)]
*  100%. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6294.16s)]
*  They're telling you this constantly. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6294.8s)]
*  They're saying, hey, you're different [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6296.24s)]
*  and just let you know it could happen again. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6297.28s)]
*  We gotta be very careful. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6299.2s)]
*  You gotta be on your Ps and Qs. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6300.24s)]
*  And you're a Western Jew that grows up in fucking New York. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6301.68s)]
*  You grow up in LA or something, you're like, [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6303.84s)]
*  I'm just American. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6306.48s)]
*  I'm like a white kid from America. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6307.68s)]
*  What are they talking about? [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6309.04s)]
*  You hear about the anti-Semitism will pop up sometimes, [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6309.84s)]
*  but you're like, I'm American. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6312.32s)]
*  It is my parents. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6313.5199999999995s)]
*  That was like my parents' time. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6314.72s)]
*  And then October 7th happens, [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6317.28s)]
*  disgusting act of terror from Hamas, [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6319.68s)]
*  terrorist organization in Gaza [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6321.92s)]
*  and kills over a thousand Jews. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6326.72s)]
*  And you think the reaction is gonna be empathy [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6328.88s)]
*  and sympathy and concern for you [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6332.16s)]
*  and what your people just went through, [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6334.24s)]
*  this disgusting act. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6335.599999999999s)]
*  But all of a sudden you see the next day [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6337.5199999999995s)]
*  they're like people in the streets [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6338.96s)]
*  seemingly like excited about it. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6340.08s)]
*  And there are sections, there's not everybody, [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6342.64s)]
*  but there are people that are like chanting [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6344.32s)]
*  horribly anti-Semitic things. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6346.4s)]
*  Yeah, truly anti-Semitic things. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6348.0s)]
*  100%. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6349.92s)]
*  And that's not everybody, of course, [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6350.88s)]
*  but there are documented sections [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6352.719999999999s)]
*  of the people that were doing it. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6355.2s)]
*  But enough that it confirms all of a sudden [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6356.0s)]
*  that voice that you quieted your whole life [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6358.48s)]
*  because you're like, that's just my grandparents being crazy. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6360.48s)]
*  You're like, holy shit, is it true? [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6362.4s)]
*  This is the worst case scenario. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6363.679999999999s)]
*  We are different. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6364.719999999999s)]
*  They are out for us. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6365.84s)]
*  They do hate us. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6366.88s)]
*  And they hate us because we're Jewish. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6368.48s)]
*  That's the conclusion that you would logically come to. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6371.28s)]
*  They want to exterminate us. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6374.24s)]
*  They want us gone. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6375.44s)]
*  You hear these chants. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6377.04s)]
*  So I understand what a Jewish person feels like [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6379.36s)]
*  in that moment, especially a Western Jewish person [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6381.759999999999s)]
*  who is somewhat removed from the conflict. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6384.08s)]
*  Obviously everybody there has family members, [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6386.5599999999995s)]
*  family members who have lost their lives. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6388.24s)]
*  You're aware of it, but you're living in the West. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6389.679999999999s)]
*  And you hear this thing and you're like, [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6392.719999999999s)]
*  oh my God, it is true. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6394.16s)]
*  It is true. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6395.679999999999s)]
*  We are different and people are out to get us. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6396.08s)]
*  Shit, when we were in fucking Amsterdam, [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6397.919999999999s)]
*  tell the story. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6400.5599999999995s)]
*  You guys are walking around at night. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6401.12s)]
*  Yeah, walking down the street. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6402.32s)]
*  And then this dude comes out to dove [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6403.28s)]
*  and he's like hammered walking through the streets Amsterdam. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6404.72s)]
*  And he just seemed like a regular dude. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6407.280000000001s)]
*  He was like fist bumping everyone and being all fun. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6408.400000000001s)]
*  And he looks at dove and he's like, oh, where are you from? [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6409.92s)]
*  And dove was like, oh, I'm Moroccan. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6412.240000000001s)]
*  He's like, are you Jewish? [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6413.4400000000005s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, I'm a Moroccan Jew. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6414.400000000001s)]
*  And he goes, oh, what do you think about what's going on? [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6416.0s)]
*  And like gets in his face and like starts to like size him up. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6418.320000000001s)]
*  And dove literally is just like, look, peace for everyone. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6420.8s)]
*  We just want everyone to be happy. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6423.04s)]
*  We love everyone. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6424.08s)]
*  And he goes, yeah, we don't fuck with Israel around here. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6424.72s)]
*  We don't fuck with Jews around here. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6427.360000000001s)]
*  Your kind isn't welcome here. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6428.88s)]
*  And kind isn't welcome here is where it gets like, oh, now it's hate. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6430.4s)]
*  And then we all step in and we're like, bro, chill. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6432.96s)]
*  What are you doing? [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6434.639999999999s)]
*  The guy's like hammered. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6435.12s)]
*  He's fucking in a blackout. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6436.32s)]
*  He's like, typical Jew. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6437.5199999999995s)]
*  You always run. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6439.04s)]
*  Like you always get other people to fight your battles. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6439.92s)]
*  Typical Jew, blah, blah, blah. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6441.599999999999s)]
*  And then that was it. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6442.96s)]
*  I'd never seen anti-Semitism. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6443.679999999999s)]
*  Out in the open. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6445.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, just walking down the street in Amsterdam. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6446.4s)]
*  Yeah, you hear about it on a fucking Call of Duty. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6447.76s)]
*  You see it on comments, but you've never seen like the actual hate in Vitriol. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6450.639999999999s)]
*  And you could see how fucking isolating that must be if you're Jewish in that moment, [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6455.2s)]
*  where you're expecting the sympathy and empathy of the world for losing over a thousand innocent [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6459.84s)]
*  people. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6465.76s)]
*  We're not talking about like two armies colliding. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6466.0s)]
*  We're talking about innocent people that have died. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6468.08s)]
*  Like innocent people should never bear the cost of this ever. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6470.08s)]
*  Still hostages. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6472.8s)]
*  Still hostages to this day. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6473.76s)]
*  And then you don't feel like, oh my God, I'm fucking isolated. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6475.2s)]
*  And not only are they not giving you sympathy, some people are celebrating. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6477.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh, exactly. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6480.96s)]
*  And that's when I was reaching out to my Jewish friends. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6482.08s)]
*  I was like, oh, I don't ever think I've acknowledged that anti-Semitism is a thing still. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6484.64s)]
*  Because I think we see it like, now you're right. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6489.84s)]
*  It's not like that for a sizable percentage of human beings. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6492.4800000000005s)]
*  Also a majority, but enough that it's significant. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6496.4800000000005s)]
*  And also in the West, like you often see Jews and you're like, oh, they're doing well. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6498.8s)]
*  They're making money. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6502.24s)]
*  You'll be all right. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6503.04s)]
*  It's like you guys are like, well, you guys are doing well, but it's like, yeah, we go [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6504.24s)]
*  through racism too, but we're also struggling. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6508.72s)]
*  So I don't think there is the same sympathy or empathy given to Jews. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6511.84s)]
*  Like here in the West, it's like they'll call out anti-Semitism for it's like, oh, [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6516.160000000001s)]
*  they own the banks or whatever. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6521.200000000001s)]
*  And you're like, give me that. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6522.4800000000005s)]
*  How do I get that? [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6525.84s)]
*  So I understand that, right? [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6527.92s)]
*  And then you look at the Palestinian side. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6529.92s)]
*  And I can also see how unbelievably isolated they, isolating it is for them, where the [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6532.4800000000005s)]
*  only time they're ever talked about and their plight is ever discussed is when they're the [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6540.96s)]
*  terrorists. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6547.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6548.24s)]
*  So imagine how infuriating that is where every single day you're living, I guess, in an open [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6549.36s)]
*  air prison in Gaza. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6554.08s)]
*  Every single day there's an occupation. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6555.36s)]
*  This is not the first time buildings have been bombed. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6558.4800000000005s)]
*  This is not the first time there have been Palestinians killed. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6560.32s)]
*  Nobody's talking about it. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6562.64s)]
*  Now they're talking about, and they're talking about you guys as terrorists and rightfully [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6563.92s)]
*  Hamas, absolutely terrorist, disgusting act. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6566.72s)]
*  Nothing justifies it. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6568.400000000001s)]
*  Nothing that happened before. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6569.52s)]
*  Justify what happened to those innocent people. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6570.56s)]
*  Right. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6572.400000000001s)]
*  That's true. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6572.64s)]
*  Okay. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6573.04s)]
*  And an Israeli kid that's eight years old doesn't know what the fucking word occupation [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6575.04s)]
*  even means. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6579.120000000001s)]
*  There's no way you can justify the murdering of them. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6579.68s)]
*  Right? [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6582.400000000001s)]
*  But I can understand why these Palestinians are like the only time the media in the West [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6582.88s)]
*  ever talks about us is when we're terrorists. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6588.080000000001s)]
*  And what about our innocent people who got killed? [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6590.080000000001s)]
*  What about our innocent people? [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6591.76s)]
*  You don't ever mention that. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6592.88s)]
*  What about our innocent kids? [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6594.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6595.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6595.92s)]
*  What about what we go through on an everyday basis? [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6596.56s)]
*  Do we not have humanitarian concerns for us at all? [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6599.76s)]
*  Where the fuck is it? [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6602.32s)]
*  Where's the attention? [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6603.04s)]
*  Where's the concern? [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6603.76s)]
*  It feels like nobody cares about you. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6604.5599999999995s)]
*  That same feeling that the Jews felt on October 7th. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6607.2s)]
*  Nobody cares about us. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6610.0s)]
*  They're feeling that nobody cares about us. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6611.44s)]
*  And then when something does happen, when Hamas is this disgusting act of terror, [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6613.68s)]
*  not only does nobody care about us, now we're going to label you all as terrorists. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6617.5199999999995s)]
*  So we're already view, they're already like, hey, we're victims here. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6620.96s)]
*  Now, not only are we not victims, you stripped our victimhood. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6624.48s)]
*  We're the oppressors? [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6627.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6629.04s)]
*  While we're being oppressed? [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6629.52s)]
*  We're getting pushed off our land and then one action makes us oppressors and terrorists. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6631.04s)]
*  This has been going on for decades. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6635.12s)]
*  You guys haven't done anything. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6636.56s)]
*  And when I saw this, and I'm talking to my Palestinian friends, [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6638.8s)]
*  talking to my Jewish friends, I've realized there's this gigantic chasm that exists with this issue. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6641.84s)]
*  First of all, the casuals, the people who are not involved in it, right? [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6648.96s)]
*  Let's say the us. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6651.68s)]
*  We're still trying to figure out what the history of this is for the last 70. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6653.12s)]
*  The average person doesn't even know that they hear these buzzwords, settlements. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6657.52s)]
*  I'm the average person. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6661.4400000000005s)]
*  Occupation of part-time. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6662.320000000001s)]
*  They don't get along. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6663.68s)]
*  They can't have a Tuesday. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6664.64s)]
*  They be. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6666.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6666.72s)]
*  Literally what it is, right? [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6667.4400000000005s)]
*  And then the people that are involved, every one of them has a cousin who died, [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6668.8s)]
*  a brother who died, a family member who is fucking died. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6672.080000000001s)]
*  So they are locked in, right? [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6674.72s)]
*  And I see this chasm, I'm like, I have to understand what both sides are feeling, [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6677.200000000001s)]
*  but most importantly, what they're feeling about specific things. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6681.6s)]
*  And the distance between both sides is so far, you would think there are two different conflicts. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6684.72s)]
*  If you speak to an Israeli or a Jew about this, and you speak to a Palestinian, [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6690.400000000001s)]
*  there's no way you guys are speaking about the same conflict. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6694.400000000001s)]
*  If you open your social media, it looks like two different. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6696.16s)]
*  Two completely. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6699.280000000001s)]
*  Because, for example, there's the word that you see thrown around all the time, [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6700.56s)]
*  Zionism, Zionism, this idea, this concept that there should be a Jewish state, right? [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6704.240000000001s)]
*  Zionist is used as a pejorative. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6710.320000000001s)]
*  If you're Palestinian, calling someone a Zionist, that is a negative word. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6712.24s)]
*  Like you say, are you a Zionist, right? [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6715.36s)]
*  If you ask a Jewish person if they're a Zionist, they're just interpreting that as, [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6717.5199999999995s)]
*  do I believe that Israel should exist? [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6721.679999999999s)]
*  Well, yeah, of course, I believe Israel should exist. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6723.679999999999s)]
*  But what does the state of Israel mean to a Palestinian? [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6726.48s)]
*  It means you're pushing me off my land, you're gonna keep taking away my rights. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6729.76s)]
*  It stands for the oppression, it stands for the occupation, right? [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6732.5599999999995s)]
*  It's like asking, it's like, I'm a patriot, I love America. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6736.32s)]
*  A Native American has a different interpretation of my patriotism. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6740.24s)]
*  My patriotism represents the eradication of their people and the removal of them from their land. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6746.0s)]
*  So if a Native American asks me, are you a patriot? [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6752.24s)]
*  I go, hell yeah, I fucking love America. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6754.88s)]
*  They're like, how could you love America? [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6756.32s)]
*  You're a terrorist to them. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6758.32s)]
*  I'm, exactly. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6759.28s)]
*  As a black man, if I hear make America great again, I was like, wait, how far back? [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6760.5599999999995s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6765.28s)]
*  Literally that, 100%. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6765.92s)]
*  And to them, a lot of them, it means, hey, we used to have manufacturing jobs, [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6767.04s)]
*  my parents used to have a job. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6770.48s)]
*  That's the America I'm thinking about when I think make America great again. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6772.0s)]
*  I'm not thinking about you guys being subjugated, but obviously that's all y'all. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6774.96s)]
*  But how could you not think of it? [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6778.24s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6779.28s)]
*  So it's even the support the troops thing, Mark. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6780.16s)]
*  Like, break down that example that you had about the, [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6783.68s)]
*  like as an American, we're like, yeah, we support our troops. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6786.72s)]
*  What does that mean to the places that our troops are banging away at? [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6789.36s)]
*  Yeah, bomb the wedding that my uncle was at. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6792.8s)]
*  Those are the troops you support? [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6795.599999999999s)]
*  You're like, well, that's not what I thought. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6796.5599999999995s)]
*  When you asked me to support the troops, I support my brother-in-law. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6797.68s)]
*  That's in the Navy. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6800.96s)]
*  I support him. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6801.92s)]
*  So the words that are a sense of pride for one side are the source of oppression for another. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6803.5199999999995s)]
*  How can they even begin to have a conversation about what's going on [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6811.5199999999995s)]
*  if they can't even agree on the definition of a word? [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6815.2s)]
*  And both of them are understandably right about it, right? [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6817.599999999999s)]
*  So, so far apart, once I'm seeing like how far this chasm is, [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6822.8s)]
*  I'm like, what else is going on here? [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6827.92s)]
*  And I'm like, okay, the problem it seems like everybody's talking about currently right now [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6829.6s)]
*  is Hamas. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6834.16s)]
*  How do we get Hamas out of Gaza? [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6834.8s)]
*  Because if we could get Hamas out of Gaza, then Gaza could live free [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6837.52s)]
*  and everything would be good. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6840.400000000001s)]
*  It's Hamas, this terrorist organization that's subjugating their people. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6841.2s)]
*  And every Palestinian I've ever spoken to is like, yes, Hamas is horrible. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6844.8s)]
*  Horrible, disgusting, absolutely disgusting what they did in that terror attack. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6847.92s)]
*  It's disgusting what they've done before. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6851.2s)]
*  And it's disgusting how they've oppressed us within Gaza, right? [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6852.56s)]
*  Every single person I've ever spoken to, just like every single Jew I've ever spoken to, [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6856.160000000001s)]
*  is like, yeah, we want a two-state solution. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6859.360000000001s)]
*  We want them to be able to live free. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6861.04s)]
*  We want to be able to live free. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6862.64s)]
*  We don't want this at all. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6863.68s)]
*  Every single Jewish person I've spoken to is like, we don't even want the settlements. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6865.200000000001s)]
*  Why are we keeping to do the settlements? [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6869.04s)]
*  You're just aggravating this fucking situation. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6870.320000000001s)]
*  These people on both sides- [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6872.240000000001s)]
*  Don't like the Israeli government either. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6873.84s)]
*  Bro, there was huge fucking like there was like riots and there was these huge protests [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6875.76s)]
*  in Israel before up to for like six months up to October 6th about how divided the country was [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6879.76s)]
*  about, you know- [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6884.56s)]
*  I went to Israel with Weezy and almost everyone we spoke to like and younger kids around our age. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6885.92s)]
*  It's like all don't like the government exactly. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6891.12s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6893.84s)]
*  And I think it's probably no different for like American intervention strategies where [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6894.24s)]
*  it's like, I don't think that's representative of American sentiment. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6897.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6900.96s)]
*  I don't think if you ask the average American like, yeah, we should fucking be in Afghanistan [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6901.2s)]
*  for 25 years. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6904.4800000000005s)]
*  That's what we need. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6905.2s)]
*  We're like, no, we're like so far removed from it. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6905.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6909.04s)]
*  But if you're an Afghanistan, if you're a person from Afghanistan, if you're Afghani- [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6909.84s)]
*  Afghan. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6913.52s)]
*  If you're an Afghan, you're like, how could I separate you from your government? [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6914.16s)]
*  How can I? [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6919.6s)]
*  Like it's your government that's doing this to me and you vote them in, right? [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6920.4800000000005s)]
*  Isn't it a democracy? [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6924.0s)]
*  And then you just claim ignorance? [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6924.64s)]
*  Fuck you. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6925.84s)]
*  You're taking my rights. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6926.8s)]
*  You're killing my family members and you're somehow removing that. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6927.84s)]
*  No, fuck you. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6930.56s)]
*  You vote these people in. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6931.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6931.92s)]
*  And then I mean, and there was this guy Bassem Youssef that was on Pierce Morgan. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6932.64s)]
*  He had this interview and he brought up an interesting point. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6937.12s)]
*  He's like, people bring up this thing about Hamas all the time. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6939.04s)]
*  But Hamas is the issue. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6941.68s)]
*  And he goes, there's no Hamas in the West Bank and Israel continues to occupy. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6943.04s)]
*  There's a apartheid state and they continue to expand these settlements. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6949.84s)]
*  You can't tell me. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6953.44s)]
*  He's basically saying, what is the excuse for that? [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6955.2s)]
*  Like why isn't there this dreamlike scenario over in the West Bank if there's no Hamas, [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6958.48s)]
*  if Hamas is the only issue? [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6963.28s)]
*  And I understand that frustration as well. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6965.12s)]
*  I understand that frustration for the Palestinian people who are like, hey, [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6967.2s)]
*  yeah, let's agree. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6971.76s)]
*  Let's get Hamas out of here. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6972.48s)]
*  But where is the good faith? [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6973.76s)]
*  Show us the good faith that it will be different. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6975.679999999999s)]
*  How can I believe, if you're Palestinian right now, you're like, how can I believe [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6977.679999999999s)]
*  it's gonna be a different scenario than the West Bank if we have the scenario without Hamas [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6980.0s)]
*  and there's still people that are living and struggling under the occupation? [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6984.4s)]
*  I get that frustration. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6988.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6989.36s)]
*  Israel needs to show that proof that with the scenario without Hamas, is it better? [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6990.4s)]
*  Of course. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6996.4s)]
*  But are they still living? [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6996.799999999999s)]
*  Is it still occupied? [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6998.16s)]
*  Is it still an apartheid state? [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=6999.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7000.719999999999s)]
*  They need to prove that. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7002.16s)]
*  They're the ones in control. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7003.5199999999995s)]
*  They're the ones in charge. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7004.639999999999s)]
*  I think it's their burden of proof. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7005.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7007.679999999999s)]
*  Those you think? [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7008.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7009.04s)]
*  But yeah, I don't think we're here to necessarily offer a solution, [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7010.4s)]
*  but just to empathize with both sides that are- [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7013.28s)]
*  Yeah, there's no way we could. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7016.08s)]
*  ...the biggest thing that's lacking across the board. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7017.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7019.679999999999s)]
*  I think if both, and not geopolitically, but person to person, if both sides just [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7019.92s)]
*  acknowledge, yeah, man, what happened to you is fucked up, [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7025.12s)]
*  I think they would be way more receptive to hearing the other side. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7027.92s)]
*  If Palestinians are like, hey, man, I understand a lot of people are anti-Semitic [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7031.04s)]
*  and that probably sucks and historically you have been oppressed, that sucks, [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7034.24s)]
*  then I think Israelis would be like, yeah, also what's been happening to you guys [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7038.0s)]
*  doesn't justify the terror attack, but you were oppressed for decades [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7041.6s)]
*  in your own homeland and that's fucked. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7046.48s)]
*  I think, yeah- [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7048.96s)]
*  It's just so hard, I imagine, for both sides to even begin to offer the olive branch when [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7049.6s)]
*  you feel like you're being stepped on. It's like, yeah, it's just, it's, look, again, [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7054.72s)]
*  like you said, we're not here to offer a solution, but we are here to offer that [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7061.12s)]
*  observation that there is this gigantic chasm between both sides and even how they're [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7064.72s)]
*  interpreting the same, not only events, but reaction to those events. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7069.12s)]
*  I can't even imagine the frustration you must feel if you're Palestinian. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7076.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7082.64s)]
*  And there's not a peep about anything you're going through until your side commits an act of terror. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7083.12s)]
*  And I can't even imagine the frustration of Jews, that innocent Jews, a thousand of them [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7088.8s)]
*  are fucking murdered and there are people in the streets seemingly supportive of it. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7093.84s)]
*  Really, chanting some crazy things and like, fuck. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7097.2s)]
*  Yeah, and we're not even bringing in the geopolitical chess moves that are being made [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7101.5199999999995s)]
*  outside of their situation, how this is really a proxy in a lot of ways for what other countries [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7106.48s)]
*  are trying to either stop or how other countries are trying to bring attention away from certain [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7112.48s)]
*  things. Like Russia has everything to gain from America putting money into this struggle, [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7118.0s)]
*  from America bringing warships into this struggle. What happens if we start pulling money away from [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7122.959999999999s)]
*  Ukraine and that support and Russia takes that immediately. So if I'm Russia, I want to bolster [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7127.679999999999s)]
*  this as much as I possibly can fan that flame. If you're Iran, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Israel, [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7132.4s)]
*  we're about to sign a deal that they're going to be friends publicly. First time, I think in [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7138.24s)]
*  history. If I'm Iran, I'm like, I can't let that happen. I got to do something right here. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7142.32s)]
*  I have to support something that's going to make Israel behave in a way that's going to make Saudi [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7147.92s)]
*  Arabia not able publicly to sign some sort of agreement or accords with them because they have [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7152.24s)]
*  to save face. It's, yeah. And like most wars, rich and powerful people will probably benefit [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7160.639999999999s)]
*  and poor innocent people will probably suffer. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it is just, anyway, [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7166.4s)]
*  it's super tragic and I know a lot of people were asking us to talk about it. I'm sure that [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7172.08s)]
*  we'll continue to, but I think it was important for us to take a moment and really digest what [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7176.48s)]
*  was going on so we could be thoughtful about it. A lot of people reach out, hey, you need to talk [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7183.76s)]
*  about Palestine. You need to talk about Israel. You need to show your support. You need to show [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7188.08s)]
*  your support. And it's like, what they're really saying is you need to echo my feelings. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7191.44s)]
*  And that's not what we have to do. Right? We have to look at this, digest it and talk about it in a [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7197.2s)]
*  way that we feel represents our feelings on it and is most honest. Yeah. I think the thing we can all [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7203.679999999999s)]
*  agree on is that what's happening over there is tragic. Yeah. Like the killing of innocent people [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7210.5599999999995s)]
*  is horrible. This is- Yeah. On both sides, no justification for it. Yeah. And if we miss something, [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7215.44s)]
*  don't kill us. We just want peace. Yeah. A hundred percent. And hopefully that, [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7221.04s)]
*  yeah, hopefully that will be- Shit, man. At this point, I'm like, yo, just cease fires. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7228.0s)]

*  hopefully we get that and then we get some sort of pause on this. It feels like that's [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7243.36s)]
*  the only thing that's been happening over the last 70 years. This is pause, pause, pause. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7249.6s)]
*  But yeah, at a certain point in time, yeah, at a certain point in time, [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7256.8s)]
*  something needs to happen. I don't know what that is. I don't even know how you begin to [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7263.6s)]
*  solve a situation like this. Yeah. I don't think we're gonna solve it. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6SDzhvVA3o&t=7270.4800000000005s)]
