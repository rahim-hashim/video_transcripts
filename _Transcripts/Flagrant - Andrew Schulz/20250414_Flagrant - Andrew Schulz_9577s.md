# Triple H: WWE Champs are Selfish, John Cena’s Heel Turn, & How Vince McMahon Never Loses
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [April 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A)
*  Guys, I'm sure you're all familiar with the old proverb, everything is wrestling. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=0.0s)]
*  Politics, business, entertainment, every industry thrives on character development, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4.38s)]
*  storytelling and building an audience. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9.02s)]
*  Wrestling is a mirror for whatever is happening in culture. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=10.68s)]
*  So if you want to understand culture, just watch wrestling. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=13.8s)]
*  And no one understands the art of storytelling and [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=17.6s)]
*  brand building better than our guest today is a 14 time WWE world champion, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=19.68s)]
*  a two time world rumble winner. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  And now he's behind the scenes running world wrestling entertainment. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=25.16s)]
*  He's a man of many monikers, terrorizing Jean Paul Leveque, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=28.78s)]
*  Hunter Hearst Helmsley, the game. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=32.56s)]
*  But today we're gonna call him Triple H. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=35.56s)]
*  Give it up for our guest. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=37.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=38.04s)]
*  Okay, first question, I'm doing some research on you. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=40.64s)]
*  And I come across this story, I don't know if it's legend, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  you can break it down for us. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=46.28s)]
*  But basically, one of the worst moments in your career, you get punished unjustly. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=47.28s)]
*  And because of that punishment, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=52.6s)]
*  one of the greatest superstars in the history of wrestling is created. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=54.08s)]
*  Tell us how we get there. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=58.32s)]
*  Yeah, I'll just, I'll lead you into what's supposed to happen. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  So at that point in time, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=62.28s)]
*  I'm starting to get some momentum going in my career. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=64.2s)]
*  And there's a plan in place that I am going to win a very, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=68.84s)]
*  especially at the time, was a very prestigious tournament called the King of [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=74.2s)]
*  the Ring. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=77.48s)]
*  I would be crowned King of the Ring, which would then launch me into a program or [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=78.6s)]
*  an angle with Shawn Michaels, who was champion. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  Or I think at the time when they brought it up, he was either champion at that [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=88.16s)]
*  time or was going to be champion by that time. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=91.6s)]
*  And I was going to sort of escalate myself up into that higher level of being [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  a heel, a bad guy. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=99.72s)]
*  And Shawn was a baby face champion. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=101.44s)]
*  So we were gonna go into this program into that year. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=103.16s)]
*  So it would have been a huge, what we would call push for me in the business. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=107.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it just would have really been the thing that launched me. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=111.76s)]
*  Also, this is years into the business. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=115.44000000000001s)]
*  This is not early. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=116.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's years into the business, but early for me in WWE to a degree. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=117.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=121.76s)]
*  And at that same point in time, the business was going through transitional [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=122.68s)]
*  changes, right? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=127.76s)]
*  So at that time, I'm still Hunter Helmsley, I'm the Blue Blood Snob. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  There's still, everybody's gotta have sort of gimmicks and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=132.0s)]
*  characters that are not necessarily just like you're a wrestler. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=136.36s)]
*  You're a fireman or a cop or the clown. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=140.72s)]
*  Long out with the two by four. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=145.28s)]
*  Yeah, whatever it is, the gimmicks are larger than life, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=146.84s)]
*  sort of cartoony characters. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=150.0s)]
*  But backstage, there's a group of us that hang out together that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=154.04000000000002s)]
*  were known as the clique. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=157.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=158.24s)]
*  Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, Shawn Waltman, Shawn Michaels, myself. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=164.32s)]
*  And I was kind of, they were kind of just friends that all hung out together. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=165.2s)]
*  Sort of Luger gave them the name The Clique, cuz they were always together. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=171.8s)]
*  I sort of come in at that same time. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  For whatever reason, I get along great with those guys. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=177.4s)]
*  We all end up as a group, we're known as The Clique. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  Now, you're known as a group backstage. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=181.32s)]
*  Backstage, but not on- [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=183.56s)]
*  Because onstage, some of you guys are baby faces, some of you guys are heels. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=184.6s)]
*  Yes. And from my understanding, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=187.48s)]
*  the heels and the baby faces never even really hung out that much backstage. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=189.4s)]
*  They would never ride around together. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=192.88s)]
*  To a degree. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=195.0s)]
*  Slightly before that, you go a generation before that, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=196.6s)]
*  nobody even associated with each other. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=199.83999999999997s)]
*  If they walked into a bar and there was a bad guy in there and [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  a good guy walked in the bar, you'd just leave. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=206.16s)]
*  So you basically keep the K-Fabe going. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=207.79999999999998s)]
*  Keep it going all the time. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=209.83999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=211.88s)]
*  And that was at a period of time where guys were getting into fights over, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=212.39999999999998s)]
*  if somebody came to you and said, that stuff's fake, whatever, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=217.12s)]
*  try to criticize it, or you'd get the shit kicked out of you. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=220.67999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and there was a lot of badasses in the business at that time that [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=224.04s)]
*  were not afraid to do that. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=228.16s)]
*  You had guys like Harley Race and things like that that would really, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=230.48s)]
*  they were legitimate badasses. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=236.48s)]
*  And if somebody questioned the business, they'd end up being up, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=238.04s)]
*  knocked out, broken leg, whatever. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=242.16s)]
*  And the idea is that you have to protect the business because [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=244.64s)]
*  without the business, there's no job. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=247.0s)]
*  And it's all predicated on this idea that this is 100% real, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=249.28s)]
*  not scripted, and people need to believe. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=253.2s)]
*  Yeah, though as you move forward out of that, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=255.48s)]
*  I think people became accepting of, it's just great entertainment. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=257.52s)]
*  Yeah, so I wanna get to this later because I don't wanna throw up this story. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=260.8s)]
*  But I think one of the coolest things that I've learned now, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  especially different from when I was a kid watching wrestling, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=267.56s)]
*  is how aware the average wrestling fan is of what's going on. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=269.4s)]
*  And it's become really meta. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=274.0s)]
*  To click away. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=275.4s)]
*  Yeah, to click away. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=276.96s)]
*  All the information. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=278.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=279.35999999999996s)]
*  And what's fascinating about our business is, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=279.88s)]
*  as interesting as the characters we put on TV, right? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=283.35999999999996s)]
*  So there's a moment where there's some people that are just interested in what [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  they see on TV. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=291.08s)]
*  There's some people that are just as fascinated, if not more so, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=292.32s)]
*  with what happens behind the scenes. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=295.67999999999995s)]
*  The sort of the, who that person is in real life, the politics of it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=297.59999999999997s)]
*  They make up their own stories in some manner of the things that are going on. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=302.47999999999996s)]
*  I know that guy hates that guy and they don't get along at all. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=306.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=308.84000000000003s)]
*  You know, we will even perpetuate that through the internet and [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=309.36s)]
*  things like that where it might not have anything to do with a story that is [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=314.6s)]
*  happening on the show, but we'll perpetuate that partially. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=318.2s)]
*  As we get into this, I think that's important that you brought that up because [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  I think that's a huge game changer that I hope you get credit for in wrestling. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=326.16s)]
*  And blurring the lines of what's happening backstage and on stage. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=332.8s)]
*  So part of that translates into, or relates to this story. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=336.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=341.0s)]
*  What you're talking about. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=341.52s)]
*  So that group, the clique, were all very tight backstage. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=342.28s)]
*  It's not like common knowledge. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=346.24s)]
*  I wouldn't say everybody knows it, but there's a section of fans that at that [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=348.68s)]
*  time, you know, this is before the internet, are really beginning to [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=353.59999999999997s)]
*  understand what goes on behind the scenes and who's really tight and who's not. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=358.03999999999996s)]
*  These guys are friends and that guy isn't and they don't like this guy and [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=361.72s)]
*  there's politics with that, whatever. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=364.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=365.8s)]
*  So Kevin Nash and Scott Hall make a deal with WCW to leave. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=366.92s)]
*  The rival league who's throwing money around at this point, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=374.96000000000004s)]
*  signing away a bunch of people. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=377.16s)]
*  There's a thing, a Monday night war going on. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=378.12s)]
*  Vince is coming off of trials and all this stuff where the business is sort of down. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=381.12s)]
*  WCW goes on the attack and one of the things that they do is they start really [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=387.0s)]
*  coming after talent with big checks. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=391.32s)]
*  Whereas Vince sort of puts you into a position where you are participating in [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=394.12s)]
*  the revenue of the business. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=399.84s)]
*  So if we went to Madison Square Garden and it was sold out, the gate is this. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=401.64s)]
*  There's a percentage of that gate that gets paid to talent. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=405.8s)]
*  That's divvied up amongst the talent. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=408.68s)]
*  There's percentages. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=410.44s)]
*  So if business is good, you make more money. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=411.71999999999997s)]
*  If business is down, you make less money. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=413.84s)]
*  And that's why you protect the business. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=415.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=417.12s)]
*  And so WCW, they were just paying guys money. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=417.96s)]
*  Guaranteed. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=421.32s)]
*  So Scott Hall decides he's leaving shortly thereafter. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=422.52000000000004s)]
*  Kevin Nash goes through this big thing where he doesn't want to leave, but [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=427.88s)]
*  they're offering him so much money. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=432.52000000000004s)]
*  And our schedule in WWE was at that point in time, we were working 200, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=434.16s)]
*  250 days a year, around the world all the time. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=439.64s)]
*  Physically grueling. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=442.28000000000003s)]
*  Yes, just nonstop. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=443.48s)]
*  Just the travel wears out a comedian. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=445.48s)]
*  If I see travel to sit on a stool on stage, I'm exhausted. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=447.64000000000004s)]
*  You guys are flying through cages. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=451.40000000000003s)]
*  And in the same business, the best part of what you do is when you're on that stage, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=453.40000000000003s)]
*  when you're in that ring. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=458.28000000000003s)]
*  And that other 23 hours and 20 minutes of the day is the shit you put up with to get [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=459.48s)]
*  to do your job. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=464.04s)]
*  But guys are doing it. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=466.52000000000004s)]
*  It's grueling, it's relentless. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=469.32000000000005s)]
*  And Kevin gets in a place where they're offering ridiculous money, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=470.68s)]
*  but he still doesn't want to go. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=474.92s)]
*  There's a moment where he tells me, right when he has to give the answer, I'm home, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=476.44s)]
*  he calls me and he's like, I'm not going, I'm staying, I can't do it. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=480.52s)]
*  And then two days later, we're at TV and he's like, I just gave Vince my notice. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=483.79999999999995s)]
*  I'm like, I thought you weren't going. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=488.52s)]
*  And he's like, basically my wife said, you don't either take that money. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=489.55999999999995s)]
*  I'm not raising this kid by myself with that schedule anymore. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=494.52s)]
*  You take that money. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=498.28s)]
*  So they shrunk the schedule for WCW. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=499.23999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, WCW was working, they would mostly just do it on TV. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=501.47999999999996s)]
*  They were doing some live events, right? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=505.88s)]
*  But probably the schedule was half. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=507.64000000000004s)]
*  How are they able to give out bigger checks if they weren't doing as much? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=510.92s)]
*  That's why they're out of business. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=514.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it was Ted Turner, it was TBS, a lot of money, a lot of... [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=519.48s)]
*  And there's a certain point in time where when you're just paying a lot of money [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=524.2s)]
*  and the revenue's not coming in, like, well... [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=529.16s)]
*  It's a time bomb. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=533.16s)]
*  Any fool can run a business in the red. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=534.68s)]
*  Don't take a genius to do that. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=537.9599999999999s)]
*  Kevin and Scott are leaving, Sean and I are staying. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=542.76s)]
*  There's another guy in the group, Sean Waltman, but he isn't at Madison Square Garden. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=546.8399999999999s)]
*  But we're doing a show at Madison Square Garden. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=550.1999999999999s)]
*  It's their last time at Madison Square Garden. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=552.76s)]
*  They're leaving shortly thereafter. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=555.16s)]
*  And Sean comes to me during the day and he's like, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=557.4799999999999s)]
*  hey, I mentioned something to Vince about us all going out at the end of the show [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=562.68s)]
*  and having a moment together. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=566.3599999999999s)]
*  And I said, what did Vince say? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=568.92s)]
*  And he was like, yeah, I guess if that means a lot to you or something like that. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=570.28s)]
*  And so it was kind of very vague. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=574.68s)]
*  But what was weird about it was... [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=577.16s)]
*  It's funny, that's not how... [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=578.5999999999999s)]
*  So what's weird about it is, to the business, is [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=582.12s)]
*  Scott and I are going to wrestle earlier in the show, like a street fight. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=588.4399999999999s)]
*  And I beat Scott and the whole thing. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=593.3199999999999s)]
*  And then Sean and Kevin are going to work a cage match for the WWE title, whatever, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=595.72s)]
*  in the close of the show. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=606.1999999999999s)]
*  So us coming out there to have a moment together is sort of contrary to the show. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=609.16s)]
*  Of course. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=613.4s)]
*  Now when the time comes to do this, Scott and I wrestle earlier. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=614.76s)]
*  We have this knockdown, drag out street fight, and then now Kevin and Sean go in there. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=621.0s)]
*  And we're kind of at the end of the show. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=625.08s)]
*  And the way the Garden was set up in the past, there's a side vom that [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=626.44s)]
*  guys would always stand at to watch the show. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=632.5200000000001s)]
*  Vince would stand at this curtain. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=634.44s)]
*  His dad would stand at that curtain. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=636.2800000000001s)]
*  That's where they would watch from. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=637.8000000000001s)]
*  And Scott and I were standing there and they kind of get to the end of the match. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=639.48s)]
*  And Sean is kind of looking back at us. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=642.76s)]
*  And Scott says to me, are we supposed to go out there? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=647.24s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know, dude. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=649.56s)]
*  And then Scott looks at Vince and he goes, are we supposed to go out there? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=650.68s)]
*  And he's like, we're all unsure. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=653.24s)]
*  And then Scott's like, fuck it, I'm going. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=656.4399999999999s)]
*  And he just goes. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=659.08s)]
*  And I think in his mind, I'm quitting. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=660.28s)]
*  Yeah, I'm out of here anyway. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=662.4399999999999s)]
*  He means no cost to him. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=663.56s)]
*  Fuck it, I'm going. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=664.76s)]
*  And I'm like, well, fuck then. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=665.64s)]
*  They were kind of looking, waving back at me. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=668.04s)]
*  And I'm like, shit, all right, here I go. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=669.56s)]
*  So we go out there and we have this moment. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=671.9599999999999s)]
*  And I mean, the garden sold out and they go ballistic. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=674.68s)]
*  So the people are happy to see you all acknowledge that you're friends and break the cage. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=679.3199999999999s)]
*  It's this crazy moment, right? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=683.4s)]
*  It's this crazy moment of like, most people I believe in that time, probably in the garden, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=685.3199999999999s)]
*  especially in New York, are so savvy to everything. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=690.12s)]
*  Like, they know we're all friends. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=692.04s)]
*  They get it, right? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=693.64s)]
*  And they know they're leaving. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=694.84s)]
*  And this is like an incredible real, real life moment. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=696.76s)]
*  First time in wrestling history this has happened, where you kind of break. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=701.48s)]
*  Probably. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=704.84s)]
*  That's my understanding. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=705.8000000000001s)]
*  One of the big moments where it actually happened. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=706.36s)]
*  So we do it. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=709.1600000000001s)]
*  When we come back, everybody's gone. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=711.48s)]
*  Like everybody. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=716.36s)]
*  And like usually there's at the garden, like there's people back there, the agents, all this. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=717.96s)]
*  So we come back, everybody's gone. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=722.6s)]
*  I'm like, that's not a good sign. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=723.6400000000001s)]
*  So Sean goes and talks to Vince and Vince says, well, that was a lot different than [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=725.4s)]
*  what I thought it was going to be. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=729.4s)]
*  And Sean said, hope I was okay. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=731.48s)]
*  And he said, well, did that mean something to you? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=733.0799999999999s)]
*  And Sean goes, met the world to me. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=735.0s)]
*  And he goes, then I'm okay with it. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=736.28s)]
*  And we left. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=738.36s)]
*  And we used to stay in, at the time we stayed in Newark. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=739.56s)]
*  And there's a place, a diner. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=743.4s)]
*  Business is different now. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=745.88s)]
*  We all drive back. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=748.52s)]
*  We would, if we were doing the garden, Long Island, all that stuff, New York was a big hub. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=749.3199999999999s)]
*  We'd go stay in Newark. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=753.56s)]
*  At the airport and just make the balance. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=755.8s)]
*  Right? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=757.8s)]
*  So you could stay in one place. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=757.9599999999999s)]
*  So we went back. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=760.28s)]
*  We all had dinner together, this diner and stuff like that. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=761.0799999999999s)]
*  And we were all like, well, that was crazy. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=764.04s)]
*  What just happened and all that shit. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=765.56s)]
*  And, you know, big moment. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=767.7199999999999s)]
*  So the next day I'm off, the next day I'm driving up. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=770.6s)]
*  I lived in New Hampshire at the time, driving back up. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=774.12s)]
*  And as soon as I get home, there's a message from Vince's office, his secretary saying, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=776.92s)]
*  Vince would like to see you first thing in the morning tomorrow. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=783.8s)]
*  And I'm like, fuck. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=786.68s)]
*  Like, this isn't going to be good. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=788.28s)]
*  Like he ain't calling to go like, dude, wonderful job. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=791.16s)]
*  Like, is my day off? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=795.0s)]
*  I got to, you know, I got to go there. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=795.88s)]
*  So I like literally turn around, drive all the way back, go back to the office the next day. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=798.28s)]
*  And this is the, this is the meeting where like, everybody's freaking out. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=803.88s)]
*  And Vince was even putting it on. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=811.0799999999999s)]
*  I wasn't so sure that he was upset with it. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=813.0s)]
*  Everybody else. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=816.36s)]
*  And you have to understand all the producers and agents [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=817.16s)]
*  backstage and help with the show and everything are a generation before. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=819.56s)]
*  So they're of the generation of protective business at all costs. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=823.56s)]
*  Bad guys don't ride with good guys, right? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=827.0s)]
*  To some degree, they all go nuts when they see this. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=829.32s)]
*  And now Kevin's leaving, Scott's leaving and to those producers and agents. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=833.72s)]
*  Well, look, it looks bad to it for Vince. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=840.12s)]
*  It looks like the inmates are running the asylum and he doesn't have control over these guys. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=843.0s)]
*  These this group, the clique has like, is doing whatever they want and they spit right in your face. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=847.0s)]
*  And if you don't do something, it looks bad. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=852.76s)]
*  It's a disrespectful type thing. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=855.24s)]
*  And I don't think Vince took it that way, but I think that's what he was. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=857.56s)]
*  He always had a saying, perception is reality. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=861.64s)]
*  And perception amongst them was this. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=864.84s)]
*  This and so, you know, as soon as I knew, I wasn't sure. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=869.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm like, well, I'm either going to get fired or this is going to be like, I'm going to get [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=875.8s)]
*  like, this is going to be heavy. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=879.4s)]
*  And, um, you know, what a drive from New Hampshire. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=882.76s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=887.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=888.8399999999999s)]
*  So, but, but I was, you know, I was kind of like, well, it is what it is. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=890.1999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=893.4s)]
*  And I'm a big believer in like, if you're going to do something that in your mind, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=893.9599999999999s)]
*  it's kind of fucked up. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=898.44s)]
*  Like you cannot cry afterwards with whatever comes about. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=899.32s)]
*  You made the decision to do it. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=903.24s)]
*  So if the ramifications of that are way worse than you thought, well, that's on you. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=904.6s)]
*  You made the choice. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=910.36s)]
*  So, um, yeah, it's, it's a pretty heavy meeting and Vince is like, look, uh, it's unfair. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=911.08s)]
*  It's all these things, but Kev's leaving, Scott's leaving. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=920.12s)]
*  I can't do anything to them. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=923.08s)]
*  Kid wasn't there, but Sean was there, but he's the WWU champion. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=924.52s)]
*  Sean Michaels is a champ. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=927.8s)]
*  You can't punish the champ. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=928.68s)]
*  Not much I can do to him. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=929.48s)]
*  So you're like, he has to call it a wash. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=933.72s)]
*  We just move on. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=936.1999999999999s)]
*  And, uh, yeah. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=937.0s)]
*  And he was like, well, you know, here's the thing. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=937.88s)]
*  A lot of people are saying I should fire you. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=939.88s)]
*  And I'm like, okay, what are you, what are you saying? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=942.84s)]
*  And he said, I don't want to fire you. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=945.88s)]
*  I think you're incredibly talented. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=947.24s)]
*  I think you, I want you here, but you know, I've, I've got to do something. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=948.68s)]
*  And so he was, you know, you were going to win king of the ring. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=954.76s)]
*  That's going to go away. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=957.32s)]
*  You were going to do this program with Sean. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=958.9200000000001s)]
*  That's going to go away. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=960.52s)]
*  You are going to, and this is one of Vince's favorite sayings, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=962.0400000000001s)]
*  but this was the time when he said it to me, when he hit the artist, he said, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=964.9200000000001s)]
*  you are going to have to learn to eat plate fulls of shit and like the taste of it. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=968.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=975.96s)]
*  And I said, so the one thing, you know, I was accepting of it obviously hit hard, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=976.36s)]
*  but I was accepting of it. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=980.2800000000001s)]
*  I said to him before I left, I said, here's him because he said, but if you want to leave, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=981.24s)]
*  he said, I understand. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=985.9599999999999s)]
*  This is not all on you. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=987.3199999999999s)]
*  If you want to leave, if you think you can get a job with Turner, with those guys, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=989.0799999999999s)]
*  if you want to leave, I understand that I'll, I'll make it where there's a loophole in your [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=993.64s)]
*  contract. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=998.52s)]
*  And you can get out. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1000.36s)]
*  Did you consider it? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1001.16s)]
*  Did you? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1002.12s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1002.36s)]
*  I didn't. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1003.0s)]
*  I didn't want, I had come from there. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1003.4s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1005.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1005.88s)]
*  So before I came in, so I kind of knew, even though it had rose risen dramatically, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1006.28s)]
*  and their business had gone through the roof, I was like, I don't want to be there. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1011.08s)]
*  I'm here for a reason. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1015.0s)]
*  This is the place where they can make me. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1017.4000000000001s)]
*  What felt better? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1018.9200000000001s)]
*  What felt different? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1019.64s)]
*  They didn't have a clue what they were doing there. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1021.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1023.64s)]
*  And it was, it was literally the inmates running the asylum. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1024.04s)]
*  And I knew that like, you knew you had a boss right here. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1026.92s)]
*  You knew that there was one place to get the final answer from, and that it came from one place. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1033.24s)]
*  And that sometimes it's all you need is whether you like the decision or you don't. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1039.08s)]
*  You need somebody to make a decision. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1042.6s)]
*  It can't be, well, we, I think this, and then you go to this guy and he's like, no, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1044.4399999999998s)]
*  I don't want to do that. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1049.0s)]
*  I want to do this. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1049.72s)]
*  And he's got some kind of creative control, but this other guy's got creative control too. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1050.36s)]
*  And it's just a mess. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1053.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1054.36s)]
*  It's a mess. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1054.76s)]
*  So one of the things I said to Vince was I said, I don't want to leave. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1057.8799999999999s)]
*  I said, if, but if I have no choice, then well, that's what I have to do. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1062.28s)]
*  But I said, let me just ask you a question is I said, I'm, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1065.6399999999999s)]
*  I did the crime. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1069.48s)]
*  I'll take all the punishment, but I have to know is there, is there a point where this ends? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1070.28s)]
*  Is there a light at the end of the tunnel? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1075.48s)]
*  I'm willing to go through all the shit. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1077.24s)]
*  I'm willing to take it. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1079.32s)]
*  I'm willing to do the, do the time for what I did, but I got to know there's an end point on it. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1080.36s)]
*  If you say to me, I can't get out of this, then I got to go. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1087.08s)]
*  But if you say to me, no, no, it'll be a period of time. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1091.8s)]
*  And then you'll get the opportunity. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1095.3999999999999s)]
*  As long as I'm still delivering to where you feel like I deserve that opportunity, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1097.64s)]
*  if I can get that opportunity, then, um, that I stay. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1102.44s)]
*  And he said, as far as I'm concerned, there's no issue with me. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1107.16s)]
*  He said, as far as I'm concerned, when you walk out that door at my office, it's over. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1111.24s)]
*  It's all, it's all done. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1115.48s)]
*  And you're on flat ground with me. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1116.92s)]
*  He said, but I got up, I got up for a period of time. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1119.5600000000002s)]
*  I got to put this out to everybody else that you're fucked. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1122.68s)]
*  And then once, once I feel like that's been enough, then as long as you're still delivering, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1126.3600000000001s)]
*  you get the opportunity to come back up. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1131.72s)]
*  So, um, I left there and one of the things that I said to him before I left is I, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1135.4s)]
*  I went to the door and I stopped and I said, Hey, I just want to ask you one thing. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1140.44s)]
*  And I just want it to be something that you think about because it's been resonating with me is [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1145.16s)]
*  I understand everybody's point of view, but the world is changing and the business is [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1151.16s)]
*  changing. And I said, if what we did was so bad, then why was the largest or the loudest reaction [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1155.32s)]
*  of the entire night? What we did. Like if what we did was so bad, isn't our job to entertain those [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1162.6799999999998s)]
*  people that all paid, I guarantee you the one thing they left there saying is Holy shit. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1170.6799999999998s)]
*  At the end, they all came out. It was this moment. It was real. Right? Like I said, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1175.24s)]
*  this, the business is changing and we're either going to change with it [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1180.36s)]
*  or it's going to pass us by. And, um, he sat there for a second and he said, you might, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1184.44s)]
*  you might be right, but right now isn't the moment. And I, and I, and I left and then, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1190.5200000000002s)]
*  yeah, I went from being the guy that was going to win king of the ring to being the guy that was [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1198.2800000000002s)]
*  losing in the first round. And Jake Roberts, who was, you know, fairly old at the time was sticking [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1203.0s)]
*  the snake down my pants as a ha ha thing. And, you know, um, I had a, you know, I got every shit [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1207.72s)]
*  detail, every bad thing I got given to me. What are examples of that? Like what are examples of [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1214.2s)]
*  you getting fucked? Um, whoever was the worst guy that they wanted me to get over, like just [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1219.8s)]
*  go put that guy, go, go get, so you'd have to wrestle these guys that they're trying to build [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1227.16s)]
*  up and they all have to beat you. Yeah. And, and, and, you know, I'm not, I'm not on any media [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1231.08s)]
*  anymore. I'm not featured in the shows. I'm just, you're just there. You're a B side fighter. I'm [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1236.12s)]
*  just at best. Right. And boxing, we call it a tomato can. Yeah. Yeah. At best. And then, so, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1240.84s)]
*  um, yeah, time went on and, you know, eventually it got to a point where I'm, I'm a big believer [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1248.12s)]
*  in like, if you're talented and, and, you know, I'll say that about myself, I guess in that manner, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1254.12s)]
*  but if you're, if you believe in yourself and you believe in your talent, then they can't [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1259.6399999999999s)]
*  only hold that back for so long that that'll eventually come out and it'll eventually rise [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1263.72s)]
*  to the top. And it's not about the storyline they give you always, or the thing they give you, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1268.3600000000001s)]
*  it's about creating your moments. This is something I tell talent all the time, maximize your minutes. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1273.48s)]
*  So even if I went out there with a shit detail, I would find something in there for me to have a [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1277.96s)]
*  moment. Yeah. Oh, that was good. Whatever. You know what I mean? Like I would have that one moment [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1285.08s)]
*  where I at least felt like I came back and I was like, that was horrible, but I at least got this [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1291.0s)]
*  out of it. Made the best of it. Yeah. And, and you sort of have to, you have to, you have to have [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1296.04s)]
*  those moments. It might be too vague to answer if it is, that's fine, you just move on. But what is [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1300.3600000000001s)]
*  an example, like a moment to like a noob like me? Yeah, that's too vague. It's fine. It could be [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1303.72s)]
*  anything, but it just could be when you have an opportunity at some point as the heel, you're [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1309.5600000000002s)]
*  going to have an opportunity to beat the shit out of the baby face. In what manner do you do it? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1314.3600000000001s)]
*  Right. So many people get into a place in our business, I think, or anything else, like in our [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1317.72s)]
*  business where you believe in yourself and you believe in your ability and the, as writers, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1326.28s)]
*  we're not using you to the best of your ability right now. That happens to everybody. Right. And [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1332.3600000000001s)]
*  there's ebbs and flows in your career. How you deal with that though is up to you. You can go [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1337.48s)]
*  out there and say, I'm going to fucking prove it to them every single night. I'm going to go out [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1343.24s)]
*  there and kill this no matter what it is. Or you can go, they're not using me. They don't care. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1347.48s)]
*  Fuck that. I'll show them and go out there and not try. Yeah. Even getting your ass kicked, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1354.2s)]
*  you can have a good performance. Phone it in. Yeah. You know, right? It's yeah. There's like, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1358.76s)]
*  anytime I'm acting or like doing some movies, like sometimes you see some real pros there, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1364.68s)]
*  right? And they might have like a line or two in the scene and they'll just find a way to make it [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1368.2s)]
*  the funniest line. Even when they're not even saying anything. Like scene stealer, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1373.16s)]
*  a guy in the background that just like, where you just can't help but look at that guy. Yeah. And [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1377.24s)]
*  it's like, it's not like they're being narcissistic. They're like given one line, they're like, how can [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1380.68s)]
*  I add to this scene and how can I make this good? And watching that is really interesting. Cause a [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1384.44s)]
*  lot of times you look at the script and you're like, okay, who is the most lines? Okay, me, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1389.3200000000002s)]
*  I'm delivering it or that person. So you can have one line. Exactly. And it could be all about. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1393.16s)]
*  Exactly. And that's the thing, right? So you can either go negative on it. I can sometimes tell [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1398.12s)]
*  watching the show, like that guy walking out, he's about to get beat by this other guy and he thinks [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1403.6399999999999s)]
*  it's wrong that they're putting that guy over him. So he's bringing out that doesn't want to do it. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1409.8799999999999s)]
*  We call it booboo face. And so he comes out and he doesn't have that same fire. Now that same talent, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1415.0s)]
*  sometimes, Oh, they're going over. This is this, this matches for them. This they're going to go [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1420.6799999999998s)]
*  over. They come out like a big star and everything they do is they're putting all the effort in and [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1426.2s)]
*  like all that stuff. Right. It's, it's, it's easy to put the effort in when they're going away. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1431.56s)]
*  Yeah. And when they're going with you, and this is all about me, the trick is to put that effort in, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1437.56s)]
*  you know, the trick is to still, you know, go to the gym, hit it just as hard, be just as good [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1442.68s)]
*  as shape, be spot on on your game and do all those things that you need to do. Because when that one [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1449.08s)]
*  time that they give you something and that you see that hole, I can do that and steal this scene [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1454.28s)]
*  and you go out there and you do that. And now that's the, after a couple of times, that stuff [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1459.16s)]
*  starts to become undeniable because the truth is we just react off what the crowd does. Yeah. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1463.48s)]
*  So when the crowd starts to see that and they start to get into a talent, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1468.52s)]
*  now you're giving that crowd what they want and they're respecting it and they're going with it. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1472.28s)]
*  We have no choice but to follow that. Yeah. Would you ever get upset at your opponent if it feels [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1476.36s)]
*  like they're just phoning it in during the match? Sometimes. And what do you do? Do you [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1480.84s)]
*  fuck them up a little bit more? Nah, you know, it just depends on who it is. You know, sometimes [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1484.6s)]
*  you just talk to them like, come on, step up or, you know, whatever it is. Sometimes you just can't [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1489.48s)]
*  help. Also guys, tour dates, Denver, I'm in Greenwood Village, Colorado at ComedyWorks South on Friday [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1494.6799999999998s)]

*  Okay. So yeah, I wonder if like eating shit for that, uh, that much time gave you like a real [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1568.76s)]
*  competitive advantage because you get used to not getting the thing. So now you're not bitter about [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1574.44s)]
*  not getting it. And also you're not afraid about being the position where you're not getting put [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1579.32s)]
*  over. Yeah. Cause you went heal a bunch of times even after your success. Yeah. Well, and I'm, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1583.32s)]
*  I think it, I don't know, there's something like, uh, at that point now I'm trying to earn my way [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1590.12s)]
*  back up. But at the same point in time, you start to begin to realize like, Oh, fuck it. If, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1598.36s)]
*  if it doesn't go well, then who knows? Like I can be here for a while. They can fire me or [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1604.6s)]
*  maybe this does, this isn't the right place for me. So I go someplace else, whatever that is. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1611.6399999999999s)]
*  You start to get to a place that is, I don't want to say you don't give a shit because you do, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1615.4799999999998s)]
*  you care more than anything, but you start to realize, fuck it. I'm just going to do my [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1623.32s)]
*  thing. You're free. Yeah. It's a free. Yeah. It's a freeing thing. You're obsessed with the outcome [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1628.84s)]
*  somewhat. Yeah. So when you see us get to a point after that, when I start to get sort of free of [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1632.52s)]
*  that junk is the time we get to do DX. We had been on Vince for a long time prior to Kevin and Scott [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1638.36s)]
*  leaving that we wanted to do this group. We wanted to sort of take what we were doing [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1646.28s)]
*  personally and put it on TV because we thought people will really think this is cool. Right. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1650.12s)]
*  Right. And Kevin and Scott are gone. You're telling people to suck your dick personally? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1655.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. You understood what it was. Yeah. You need to sell those aprons. What's that? Suck the chef. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1660.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Go look this up. So, so that was sort of just us in, in real life, right? [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1669.08s)]
*  It's just walking around the backyard. Suck the chef. Austin, Austin gets to a place where he's [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1679.08s)]
*  allowed to flip people off. Oh, sorry. We never got to the limit. Yeah. So I'll get there. But [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1684.2s)]
*  like Austin was in a place where he could flip people up. But prior to that, as we're coming out [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1688.36s)]
*  of that generation, you can't flip people off. You can't do that. You can't do anything as, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1692.84s)]
*  as talent. This is before any of this happens. Kev, Scott, myself, like we have this thing we [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1698.84s)]
*  would do where, you know, you'd get up on the turnbuckle and somebody be yelling at you, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1703.8s)]
*  flipping you off or something. And you'd just look at him and be like, Hey buddy, right? [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1706.92s)]
*  You know what I mean? That's all it would be. Or you'd be like, you know, just, just, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1712.52s)]
*  and they got it. And you move on. We, as the attitude era begins to form and sort of, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1717.4s)]
*  I'm in a place where, Hey, I just want to get out of this purgatory I'm in. And Sean's the guy, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1730.28s)]
*  we get the Vince, Vince allows us to sort of partner up on screen and DX becomes a thing. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1737.96s)]
*  And in the beginning, now we start doing all this crazy shit and he's like, fuck are you guys doing? [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1746.52s)]
*  Now I've also, over that time when I'm punished, I think Vince liked the fact that [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1753.4s)]
*  he threw all this shit at me and I never blinked. You know what I mean? Like the only one time I [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1760.68s)]
*  ever went to him and bitched in all of it. And it was because he put me in a match with a guy that [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1766.44s)]
*  was almost impossible to work with and then gave me like the worst referee that we had. And like [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1770.52s)]
*  the whole setup was bad and it went really badly. And I came back and I went off and it was like, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1775.72s)]
*  Hey, fuck it. If you're going to, if you're going to not allow me to have the chance to succeed, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1783.16s)]
*  then fuck that. I'm out of here. But you cannot give me that. You cannot give him, put me in a [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1788.52s)]
*  position where I cannot fucking succeed or cannot win and can't even do my job. Right? Like if you [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1794.44s)]
*  put me in that position, then I have no choice but to go because I cannot, I can't overcome that. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1801.56s)]
*  What was it? [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1807.4s)]
*  I was working, I was wrestling a guy that was just terrible. They wanted me to have this long [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1808.92s)]
*  match with him. They gave me the worst referee, which a referee can help you work around people's [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1815.0800000000002s)]
*  inabilities. I can talk to the referee. So if, if I need a guy to do something, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1821.24s)]
*  he's not doing something right. I can't just always walk over there and tell them like, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1829.96s)]
*  right. Like, so you tell the referee, I'm like, fucking tell him to stop doing that and fucking, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1834.2s)]
*  you know what I mean? Like the referee can go over and tell him, he said, stop doing that. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1839.32s)]
*  Right. And I have enough experience to where guys will listen, but I need that. Sometimes you need [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1843.32s)]
*  to help, especially on live TV or even tape TV. You just need to have that. Who was the guy? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1847.96s)]
*  Ahmed Johnson, a guy named Ahmed. Oh, I remember. He was like people in the ring, right? He was [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1855.64s)]
*  hurting people and he was just big and yeah, just like you couldn't understand them. And he had an [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1861.16s)]
*  attitude problem and just, you know, that's him. And, you know, they, it was just one of those [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1866.52s)]
*  things. And when I came back, I was pissed and I went to Vince and I got a promo on him and I [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1874.6000000000001s)]
*  thought he was going to go off and be well, fuck, I told you, if you don't like it, fuck you, get [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1879.48s)]
*  out of here, whatever. And he didn't, he was like, that's fair. That's fair. And I was like, okay, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1882.6000000000001s)]
*  well then fucking don't do it again. I just walked out. But he was like, that's fair. You can't, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1888.52s)]
*  if I put you, if I give dump that much shit on you, that you just can never dig out of it, then, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1895.0s)]
*  you know, so, so he, you know, change that. But I think he respected the fact that I, you know, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1900.28s)]
*  I did the time, I never bitched, I never did anything. And now it was time for me to get out [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1909.08s)]
*  of jail. And when he did, he was like, Emily, you and Sean do this group thing. Okay. So that's your [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1913.0s)]
*  reward. Sort of. Yeah. And, but Sean, I immediately just go into like overdrive on it and start doing [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1917.48s)]
*  shit that he is just- So you get an opportunity and immediately try to fuck it up as fast as we can. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1923.96s)]
*  Make up for a long time. Why don't we just tell the whole arena to suck our things? [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1928.28s)]
*  I don't think we were trying to fuck it up, but we just had that, like, we wanted that creative [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1932.6s)]
*  freedom to go do what we wanted. And the thing was, I believe that Vince was starting to see the [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1936.1200000000001s)]
*  change happening. And while everybody else was going, they can't do that. And they can't say [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1941.4s)]
*  that the TV network were telling us they can't do that. They can't say that. He was being like, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1946.04s)]
*  man, the fucking crowd is reacting to these guys. Is this around like the same time Stern is popping [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1950.28s)]
*  off too? Yes. So it's cultural. Yes. Yeah. And as we, as we always said in the documentary, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1955.0s)]
*  did a brilliant job of displaying, it's like, you know, wrestling is this great reflection of culture. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1961.48s)]
*  Yeah. It's a mirror of what is happening. Sometimes we're in front of it. Sometimes we're just [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1966.52s)]
*  following it. Yeah. But there's a mirror of sort of what is happening. And I think about that period [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1971.08s)]
*  of time, like, you know, we were, you know, we were pulling our pants down on TV and telling [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1975.72s)]
*  people suck it and all the, Oh, yeah. Suck the chef. All the shit. You gotta get a picture of the apron. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1981.24s)]
*  Or suck the cook. You're not the cop. Invited to the cookout. That's how you gotta work. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1989.96s)]
*  But it was politically correct because we didn't put the you in suck. Yeah. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1996.3600000000001s)]
*  So we're safe. Who knows what it is. Suck the cook. Who knows? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=1999.8799999999999s)]
*  But I believe he was starting to see, you know, Austin's a bit edgier, we're a bit edgier. And [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2005.6399999999999s)]
*  that stuff's really starting to get a reaction. And it's not following yet necessarily with ratings [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2011.72s)]
*  or whatever, but the crowd is telling us that's where we want to go. And again, you're seeing [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2016.12s)]
*  Stern, you know, the like the Maury Povich shows and all these shows are like so edgy. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2021.72s)]
*  There's a lot of, I can't believe I'm seeing this. Yeah. Yeah. I remember there was a show like, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2030.1200000000001s)]
*  was it Hill Street Blues or something like that, where the actor at the time, and I remember his [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2035.08s)]
*  name Dennis Franz, it was a scene where he, you know, he's at his like apartment or something and [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2039.4s)]
*  he comes out and he walks down a hallway and they show his naked ass on TV for like, you know, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2044.92s)]
*  30 seconds while he's delivering. Dennis Franz. What an ass to show. But it was like, [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2050.28s)]
*  people lost their minds. And he's like, how could they do that? And we were like, this is funny. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2055.96s)]
*  I connect the South Park and wrestling. I feel like I watch both of those. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2061.7200000000003s)]
*  It was like, being inappropriate was very cool. There's like rebellious nature happening in [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2068.2000000000003s)]
*  media and entertainment. So there's a moment in time where Vince comes to us now that he's [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2072.2000000000003s)]
*  getting so much shit from the net. Probably hip hop too. When is NWA? Same time. Yeah. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2076.68s)]
*  Yeah. Same time. So it's like every form of media. Everything is rebellious and over the top. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2081.7999999999997s)]
*  Attitude. And holy shit. And this is what year? Shock TV. This is late 90s, probably? 96-ish. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2087.3199999999997s)]
*  Like Limp Bizkit, like break shit. Yeah. So 80s is like prim proper. Everybody's got the suit on, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2095.0s)]
*  hair slick back. It's the overcorrection. And the overcorrection. Yeah. Okay. This is great. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2100.68s)]
*  Pendulum swings. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Right. And it's the overcorrection. Okay. And we are the [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2104.68s)]
*  overcorrection. Yeah. And we're pushing it to an extreme. And two things on that. There's a moment [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2110.52s)]
*  where USA network was like, you know, we'd come back from the ring and Vince would be like, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2117.0s)]
*  you guys are going to get kicked off the fucking air. Like USA is pissed. Like you gotta stop this [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2122.2s)]
*  shit. You know, I'm gonna have no choice but to fire you guys. Right. And we're like, whatever, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2127.48s)]
*  they're going crazy to some degree. You could say whatever. No, we were thinking whatever. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2131.64s)]
*  Yeah. We weren't saying it. Yeah. And then there was two things on that. One is at one point USA [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2137.8799999999997s)]
*  was out of their mind. We did a show and they sent us a letter that there's a skit that we do. That [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2145.0s)]
*  is, we looked like a presidential. Clinton had just done. I did not have sex with that, you know, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2151.7999999999997s)]
*  sexual relations with that young intern. He had just done that speech. USA network sends us a [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2159.72s)]
*  letter saying, and it was ridiculous, like DX has gone too far. So from here's the controls from the [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2166.04s)]
*  hours of eight to nine, they can no longer say these words. They can no longer refer to their [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2172.9199999999996s)]
*  genitalia. They can no longer say this. These words are acceptable. These are not. Ra was eight to [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2177.16s)]
*  11, I believe. Right. Yeah. It was eight to 10. Okay. So then it was, you know, during the nine [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2182.84s)]
*  o'clock to 10 o'clock hour, they can say these words, but they can't say these. And we were like, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2190.44s)]
*  this is ridiculous. And Vince came to us and he was like, you guys happy now? They put restrictions [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2194.28s)]
*  on us. And this is what we can and can't do. What do we want to do here? And we were like, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2199.96s)]
*  this is going to sound fucked up and let us use that. Let us use that. We'll do a skit tonight to [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2205.88s)]
*  open the show. We say all this shit. So now you're continuing to blur reality with wrestling and it [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2210.52s)]
*  feels so much more real to the audience because this is a real memo that you've gotten from USA [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2217.0s)]
*  networks. So we do this presidential almost like this, we're in the oval office and we do this [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2220.7599999999998s)]
*  presidential thing, but it breaks down between Sean and I where he's like, God damn it. I'm like, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2225.8s)]
*  fuck, you can't say that dude. Shut the fuck up. Like we're swearing, they're beeping out the [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2230.12s)]
*  swears and this whole thing. And then he ends it with, and I did not have sex with that young [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2233.88s)]
*  intern. Matter of fact, I was up all night and that's sort of the skit and we get, we do it. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2238.52s)]
*  And you know, I think Vince was partially nervous and he's a rebel in a maverick spirit. So I think [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2248.04s)]
*  partially he was like, fuck yeah. And we put it out there and the next week we got a letter back [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2253.32s)]
*  from USA. Congratulations on the ratings. Funny how you used our skit against us, our own thing [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2258.28s)]
*  against us. But it worked. Congratulations. And that was the last they criticized. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2265.32s)]
*  At this point, do you, does Vince start to realize this thing that you're trying to usher in, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2270.2000000000003s)]
*  which is blending reality and wrestling? Yes. And same with Steve and some other people, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2274.44s)]
*  characters start to change. They're open to me not being called Hunter Hearst Helmsley anymore. Like, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2280.28s)]
*  Hey, what do you want to be known as? He came to me and was like, you want to use your real name? [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2285.7200000000003s)]
*  And I think, yeah, not really. I have time and stuff invested in this. Everybody called me Triple [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2289.0s)]
*  H backstage. I was like, let's just break it down to the nickname Triple H and slowly over time, [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2294.76s)]
*  I'll change the character from what I am to where I want it to be. And he was like, okay. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2299.48s)]
*  But there also comes a time when now you're talking about like scripted and what he can control and [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2303.96s)]
*  he can't. Vince is a control freak. So one day we walk into TV and I didn't consider that. You [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2309.4s)]
*  could push his hands now, now that we're blending things from the real world and the wrestling world, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2316.76s)]
*  you could do something in the real world that forces him to incorporate it in a story in the [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2321.72s)]
*  wrestler. So if you're a control freak, you're like, I can't let the inmates run this. This is [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2326.6s)]
*  the ultimate, the inmates from the asylum. Okay. So how does he handle this? He's blending. He's [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2331.56s)]
*  trying to blend his position from being the boss and us doing what we want to do. And I'll tell [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2336.2s)]
*  two stories about it. One is that we walk into TV one day and Sean walks up, I walk in and he walks [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2342.7599999999998s)]
*  up to me. He's like, have you seen this yet? I'm like, no, what's that? He's like, it's a script. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2347.56s)]
*  I'm like, what do you mean a script? He's like, this is what they want us to say tonight. I'm like, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2351.7999999999997s)]
*  I read it and I'm like, it's terrible. And he's like, yeah, what the fuck can do in that? [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2355.08s)]
*  Wait, you never had scripts before for any of the promos you cut? [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2359.08s)]
*  He would give us the premise of what, you know, you need to talk about this or whatever. And we'd go [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2362.52s)]
*  out and do our own thing. It's probably easier than memorizing like a whole script. Yeah, sure. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2366.4399999999996s)]
*  But when you're working with multiple people. The business has been flowed in this manner, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2370.04s)]
*  right? Like, and so, yeah, like, so he gives us his script and Sean and I go to his office and [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2373.24s)]
*  we're like, what is this? And he's like, that's the script for tonight. And Sean's like, it's [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2380.92s)]
*  terrible. And he's like, well, that's what I want you to say. And Sean, Sean, cause Sean's the elder [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2385.32s)]
*  guy now. So he's, he's the stage man for the group. And he says, uh, he goes, well, fuck, oh, now that [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2390.6s)]
*  this thing's over, you guys are going to tell us how to do it. And Vince goes, yeah, that's what I [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2396.92s)]
*  want you to say. And Sean goes, well, it sucks. And I'm not fucking saying it. And Vince goes, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2401.08s)]
*  well, I need you to, I need you to go out there and I want you to read, say what's on that paper. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2407.4s)]
*  I want you to read it. And Sean goes, here's the fucking problem. You think like the honeymooners [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2411.32s)]
*  is funny. We think, we think Beavis and Butthead is funny and you don't even fucking know what that [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2416.04s)]
*  shit is. He said, you're not in touch with these kids and we're not fucking, this is not what we [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2420.6800000000003s)]
*  do. And Vince goes, well, I don't care. That's what I want you to say. And this is where Sean, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2426.92s)]
*  sometimes Sean would do shit. I would think like, how does this guy get away with this without [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2431.32s)]
*  getting fired? Like he really crumbled up the paper and threw it at Vince and bounced it off [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2434.76s)]
*  his chest. He said, why the fuck is he saying it? He walked out of the office and I was like, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2439.4s)]
*  yeah, I'm with him. He's on the way out. You're like, whoop. And then we went and did our shit. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2442.92s)]
*  But holy shit. That's why. It's so different from the perception. But you have to understand, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2448.84s)]
*  he sees it working. And he, what he truly cares about is what works. Yeah. So he's trying to, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2458.0400000000004s)]
*  exert power and force, but at the same time, you know, as long as it works, he's going to ride it. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2464.76s)]
*  Yes. He never, you better go, if you're going to say, fuck you, I ain't saying that. And you're [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2469.4s)]
*  going to walk in the other room and say, you better crush it and it better work. Otherwise, you're out. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2473.6400000000003s)]
*  See you. Thanks for coming. Sorry, I was going to ask. Do you think the pressure he was putting on [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2479.0s)]
*  you guys was from like the old guard that wanted him to do some of the classic way? Yeah, to a [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2483.96s)]
*  degree. And also he's fighting that. He's the old guard also. So he's fighting it, but he's seeing [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2489.5600000000004s)]
*  like this is not ratings or ratings. Yeah, this is, God damn, this is crazy. This is not our [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2494.36s)]
*  business, but yet again, right. And then once he realizes like, okay, shit's on. Once he learns it [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2499.8s)]
*  and he applies himself to it. And we're in this war with WCW where we're getting our ass handed to us. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2508.92s)]
*  And he realizes like, wow, all of a sudden now DX, Austin at the forefront of that, but DX, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2513.7200000000003s)]
*  Austin, you know, all these guys that it's starting to change. We're starting to pick up [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2520.52s)]
*  momentum now again. So now he's going with it because he's in a, he's, he's in a war. So [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2525.4s)]
*  one thing about Vince, he ain't losing. So he'll do anything to win. He fucking. Sorry, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2531.08s)]
*  when you look back on that paper moment, the script, is there any part of you, I just think [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2534.92s)]
*  Vince is such like a kind of a he's playing chess guy. Do you think he's like, I know they're not [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2538.7599999999998s)]
*  going to do this. I just want them to rebel. Maybe, maybe, maybe. Like this is just going to [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2543.88s)]
*  rile them up and go cut a better promo. But there's also this interesting thing with him. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2547.96s)]
*  I remember one time we, we did a, I don't even remember what it was about, but we did a, we did [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2551.32s)]
*  a promo where I was going to cut a promo on Vince. Okay. This is without him knowing. This is, he [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2557.96s)]
*  knows I'm going to cut a promo, but it's live TV. But on Vince, he knows. He knows I'm going to cut [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2565.48s)]
*  a promo on him and he's going to be out there because at this point he's still an interviewer. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2570.44s)]
*  That's right. He hasn't become, he hasn't become the boss. The Montreal thing hasn't happened. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2574.44s)]
*  So, so this is important that everybody is understanding right now. So at this point in [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2579.24s)]
*  time, there is no like blend, right? With his role and his character. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2582.68s)]
*  People know he's the boss, but he's in, he's the interviewer. And we're starting to blend that [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2586.12s)]
*  where we're telling people he's the boss and he runs it, but he's still interviewing people. Like [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2589.88s)]
*  he's not. Right. So we haven't fully just gone all in. He doesn't become Mr. McMahon, the boss owner [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2593.72s)]
*  until the Bret Hart Montreal stuff happens. Then he goes fully in on it. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2601.0s)]
*  But so we're about to go out there and cut this promo and they're telling me you need to cut a [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2606.84s)]
*  promo on Vince. Who is they? Just the creative. And Vince is like, yeah, so when we get out there, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2611.7200000000003s)]
*  you know, Sean's going to go off on me. I need you to go off on me, cut a promo on me. And I'm like, [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2618.84s)]
*  so I go to him beforehand and I'm like, Hey, how hard do you want me to go on you? And he's like, [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2622.36s)]
*  say whatever you want. And I'm like, you sure about that? He's like, say whatever you want. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2628.44s)]
*  So we get out there and I don't even know what I said, but I start to cut the promo on him. And [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2632.92s)]
*  like Vince very intense person. So as I start to cut the promo on him, all of a sudden I see his [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2638.44s)]
*  eyes change and his whole demeanor changes. And I'm like, fuck. I just crossed the line here. And [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2643.8s)]
*  but I finished the promo and I can see now he's like that whatever I said, I don't even remember [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2651.96s)]
*  what it was, sort of stuck with him. And so when we came back and he came back a little later, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2656.6s)]
*  I was like, Hey, you okay with that promo? And he was like, yeah, it's fucking fine. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2661.7999999999997s)]
*  What he was basically saying is, yeah, you cross the line with me, [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2671.24s)]
*  but it was good. It was good business. Yeah. So, you know, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2675.3199999999997s)]
*  if it was good for business, he was all in. And that was the thing. So to go back to the original [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2680.68s)]
*  story, which is the Stone Cold stuff. Yeah. So I get punished for King of the Ring. I'm not going [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2686.68s)]
*  to be King of the Ring. I'm out all that stuff. Who they put in that spot is sort of coming out of [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2692.12s)]
*  similar thing. The ring master, Steve Austin, who was just like this technically gifted wrestler, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2699.0s)]
*  who was just like this technically gifted wrestler, Steve hates it. Steve goes and pitches [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2705.8s)]
*  to Vince. I don't like this character. I want to do my own thing. Stone Cold, Steve Austin starts [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2711.2400000000002s)]
*  to form. So they take me out of the spot. They go with Steve. Steve wins King of the Ring and cuts [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2718.84s)]
*  the Austin 316 promo. Well, keep in mind, he's going against Jake the Snake, who at the time [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2725.8s)]
*  became very religious, which is a really important thing to understand. 100%. So there's signs [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2731.72s)]
*  everywhere, John 316 in support of Jake Robich because he is very religious, because he's sort [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2736.9199999999996s)]
*  of reformed, evangelical, drug addict at the time. And so Steve goes out there and cuts this Austin [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2742.8399999999997s)]
*  316 promo, which at the time, I believe Vince was pissed about and hated it. You cross the line into [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2752.36s)]
*  religion. Yeah, like this is terrible. It's all this thing. And I believe they went with the Austin. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2762.52s)]
*  Everybody else was like, not everybody, but there's a few people who were like, I'm telling you, [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2769.96s)]
*  that was, did you hear the reaction? It was great. They made the first Austin 316 shirts as a, [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2773.6400000000003s)]
*  Vince was like, I make those shirts. I guarantee you none of them sell. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2780.52s)]
*  And they did it and then they sold. And Vince was like, it was great. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2787.08s)]
*  But the line was, he goes, yeah, you got your, you got your John 316. Well, Austin 316 said, [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2791.7999999999997s)]
*  I just whooped your ass. And it's just off the cuff. If he's wrestling anybody else who's [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2797.56s)]
*  non-religious, he never says it. And then he ends up becoming, that is like the defining line. I [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2802.36s)]
*  think for Stone Cold's character. Yeah. To this day, Austin 316 shirts are still one of our biggest [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2809.08s)]
*  selling. I think people know Austin 316 more than John 316. The world is more aware of Austin 316. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2818.92s)]
*  I don't know John 316 to this day. Yeah, I don't know at all. And I started watching for like a [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2827.24s)]
*  few years in the attitude era after the Austin 316 and I'm not a Christian kid. So I was like, [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2832.52s)]
*  is that like a time of day that you feed somebody up? Now it's become a date. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2837.64s)]
*  Just talk about cultural relevance, right? Yeah. Oh, unbelievable. Okay. So what's happened? You're [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2845.2400000000002s)]
*  watching this transpire, right? That's supposed to be your shot. You're supposed to have that [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2849.56s)]
*  moment. You're supposed to cut some promo. Hunter 316. Hunter 316. Yeah. Here's the thing. Are you [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2853.4s)]
*  pissed? Is there a part of you that's excited for him? Have you accepted a different fate? [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2859.0s)]
*  Steve was one of the few guys like Steve, when I started in WCW, he was there stunning Steve [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2863.8s)]
*  Austin. He's in the middle somewhere. And he was one of the guys that was like, I'm a new kid [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2869.8s)]
*  coming in the door. And you know, that's at that time, especially very tough in the business, [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2875.24s)]
*  breaking in and, you know, young and trying to get started. And Steve was one of the few guys that [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2879.96s)]
*  would talk to me a lot and like come over and say like, Hey, dude, I noticed you were doing this. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2885.72s)]
*  Maybe try that. Whatever. Like, dude, this is the parallels with comedy are funny because [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2889.4s)]
*  I remember every like, OG comedian that was nice to me coming in. That was kind to you that helped [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2894.04s)]
*  you because there aren't a lot. Right. Exactly. Exactly. They are not a lot and far more just [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2901.7200000000003s)]
*  ignore you or you're in the way or and you remember those moments. You're just ignored. Yeah. And so [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2906.6800000000003s)]
*  Steve was one of those guys. So even when Steve came in and, you know, I liked him a lot and [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2912.52s)]
*  it's a weird thing in the business. Like one, once that wasn't happening for me, I just put it out of [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2919.7200000000003s)]
*  my mind and I was happy for Steve as, as my career progressed later. It's a funny thing. How life [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2923.4s)]
*  works. Like I look back at that now and I think if I wasn't ready, I fucking wasn't ready. Yeah. And [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2932.92s)]
*  I thought I was, you always think you always think you are. Right. And you believe that you're ready. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2943.64s)]
*  I was not. If they would have put me in that role, I wouldn't have cut my version of an Austin 3 16. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2948.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. I wouldn't have been ready. It would have floundered and I probably would have, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2955.08s)]
*  it's a great way of looking at. Yeah. And I know that now I can look back at that and say, like I [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2959.3999999999996s)]
*  was pissed at the time or I was upset or disappointed. I was using it to fuel me to do other things [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2966.2799999999997s)]
*  and become something more. But the truth is I would have fucked that up, dude, knowing failure [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2972.04s)]
*  or getting comfortable in failure is very liberating. Because when you only know that [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2977.4s)]
*  the rise in the success and you go, you have some success WCW, then you come over to WWE [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2982.76s)]
*  and you're starting to rise and then all of a sudden you get the king of ring and then you're [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2989.1600000000003s)]
*  online to get the belt and then you get the belt. You constantly have this monkey on your back where [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2991.96s)]
*  you're like, fuck, what if it all goes away? But once you've accepted it all going away, [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=2995.56s)]
*  it's already gone away. And what am I? I just came back from it. Exactly. Yeah. I just worked [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3000.6800000000003s)]
*  through it. So now you have that courage to be like, okay, I'll go heal. I'll fuck it up all over. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3004.92s)]
*  I bet a lot of guys, and I'm curious your take on this, but like they're at the top, they're a baby [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3009.16s)]
*  face and they're probably reluctant to go heal because they might go, what if I never get this [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3014.36s)]
*  chance again? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 100%. Well, you also get guys that are petrified of being a baby [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3020.2000000000003s)]
*  face because if you're a baby face and they start to boo you, you're failing. Oh, that's a different [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3028.36s)]
*  pressure. Yeah. If they boo you as a bad guy. You're doing good. It's easier to make somebody [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3033.4s)]
*  pissed off at you. I actually even, yeah, I've even thought about this. Well, and even just think [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3038.92s)]
*  about it this way. If you're trying to piss them off, but they start to like you, that's why you [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3043.32s)]
*  find a lot of cool bad guys. This is the X. Yeah. Like weren't you guys supposed to be kind of heal [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3047.4s)]
*  and then you start bullying the baby faces and then you guys kind of become baby faces. Well, [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3052.76s)]
*  we were bad guys and then Sean gets injured and Sean leaves and I reformed the group with these [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3058.2000000000003s)]
*  other guys. In that moment, we almost like, they're so excited to see the group carry on [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3063.16s)]
*  and the stuff we just transitioned who we were doing it to, to the other side. And we, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3070.12s)]
*  WCW at that point in time is on the attack. We DX do the unthinkable and we go to their show. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3076.44s)]
*  I go to their show with a fucking tank and my crew and I'm firing shots at the, like fake shots at [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3085.8799999999997s)]
*  the building and on a megaphone, you know, yelling at their fans and we're outside and it's like a [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3091.48s)]
*  riot. We go to their shows unthinkable, but it made us like the coolest. Yeah. And now like, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3096.2s)]
*  Hey, these degenerates that six months ago we hated and literally Sean and I had gotten to a [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3103.88s)]
*  point where we had some riots in towns because we people did like us so much. Now all of a sudden [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3110.2s)]
*  we're like, as popular as can be because we're defending the brand guys very quickly. We have [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3117.08s)]
*  to interrupt this episode to give some credit for probably the biggest sports fan on the panel, [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3121.64s)]
*  Mark Gagnon for having the only winning bracket in the United States of America. He called the [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3128.52s)]
*  number one seed winning it. I can't believe it. I mean, how did you put that together? How did you [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3135.3199999999997s)]
*  understand this? What makes Mark's madness so amazing is you never know what's going to happen. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3140.2799999999997s)]
*  You call it Mark's madness? It is Mark's madness. Exactly. Mark's madness, bro. I just had a feeling. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3143.56s)]
*  I'm from Florida. I just had faith in the Gator. Now, did you go to stake the leader in global [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3148.36s)]
*  betting and US social casinos to put some money down? I put some money down. How much you won? [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3152.6s)]
*  $25. Whoa. Yeah. So I'm up. I'm up. I'm up big. I was like a, basically a 10 X win. Okay. Now that [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3157.32s)]
*  we know that you can literally predict sporting events. Yes. Are there some sporting? Trump wins [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3164.84s)]
*  third term. I have a good feeling dude. He's running back. So outside of that guaranteed victory. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3169.96s)]
*  Yeah. Russia by a mile. What about UFC? What do we have? 314? 314. Yeah. What about [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3177.56s)]
*  Volk? Is he going to pull it off? Yeah. 100%. So you're going with Volk? 100%? Second round knockup. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3182.92s)]
*  Whoa. So that would be considered a top sport. Who's fighting him? Diego Lopez. No, not Diego Lopez. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3188.12s)]
*  Because that changes things a little bit depending on who he's fighting. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3196.52s)]
*  How you know he's going to win? I'm saying he's going to win. It just depends who he's fighting. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3199.16s)]
*  If he's fighting someone really good. If it's Diego Lopez. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, if it's Diego Lopez, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3203.3999999999996s)]
*  yeah, that's second round knockout. Okay. So Mark is going second round knockout. UFC 314. So you're [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3207.08s)]
*  saying Diego Lopez is a big fat pussy? Is that what you're saying? No, I'm just comparing to Volk. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3212.2s)]
*  Compared to Volk, he's going to lose second round knockout. To me, I don't know. I think he's saying [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3215.56s)]
*  Diego Lopez sucks. Well, let's get a picture of Diego Lopez. Mark talks shit about all the guys [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3219.96s)]
*  that don't speak good enough English to come on the pod. Leon Edwards, great guy. They're going [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3223.4s)]
*  to learn that fucking English. Both of these guys are bad ass. Holy shit. Yeah, no, no. He's an [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3228.84s)]
*  absolute- No, this guy's a level on the spectrum, dude. I've seen this guy. He's got Schultz's old [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3235.08s)]
*  haircut. What's going on? Yeah, no, that's second round knockout for sure. Okay. So if you were going [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3239.64s)]
*  to bet on, if you're going to bet on UFC 314 and other top sports and political events, use the [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3245.96s)]
*  promo code flagrant for your welcome bonus at stake, man. Go to stake right now. Now let's get [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3251.72s)]
*  back to this interview. I don't want to brush this one part off of you, because I think it's [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3257.56s)]
*  very important in your lore. Shawn has a bad back injury, right? Yes. I think he wrestles, who does [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3261.0s)]
*  he wrestle, WrestleMania is it Stone Cold? Austin. Yeah, he wrestles Austin and then I think Mike [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3266.2799999999997s)]
*  Tyson is the ref. Yes. Like massive match. Austin, he puts Austin over, retires for a little bit, [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3270.92s)]
*  right? Because of the back. Four years. Now, so far at this point in your career, [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3277.24s)]
*  you've always been like with the top guy. Because when I was with Shawn, right? I'm on the rise, [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3281.4799999999996s)]
*  but I'm in the middle somewhere. Sure. But like you're connected to Shawn now or before you were [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3288.8399999999997s)]
*  maybe connected to the clique, even though it was backstage, but there was a connection. So this is [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3293.64s)]
*  the first time in your career where now you are at the helm. Yes. And you asked Vince, and I remember [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3297.16s)]
*  you cut a promo where you like acknowledge Shawn, but then you very quickly move on. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3303.16s)]
*  Move on. Can you just tell me what's going through your head right there? Because there's [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3307.96s)]
*  a big transition. So when we were doing DX, Shawn and I were, we had wanted to make the group bigger [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3311.08s)]
*  and we liked Road Dogg and we liked Billy Gunn. X-Pog was actually in WCW at the time. Right. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3318.92s)]
*  Right. So we had said, look, Road Dogg was like Jesse James and Billy was Rockabilly. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3328.04s)]
*  I mean, it was terrible, terrible shit. And we were like, look, put these guys together as a tag team. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3335.8s)]
*  Let them start to do their own thing. And if it starts to get over, when the time is right, [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3340.2000000000003s)]
*  we'll put them with us and we'll make the group bigger. But we can build two young stars out of [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3344.2000000000003s)]
*  this. They start to work together. It actually starts to work. They call them the new age outlaws [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3349.2400000000002s)]
*  and it starts to work on their own. So we're like, let them do their own thing when the time is [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3354.36s)]
*  right. We'll pull them in, but let them do their own thing right now. And they're loosely associated [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3359.56s)]
*  with us. We would do things like, for example, they were trying to get going. DX was pretty over. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3364.04s)]
*  They wanted to do a program with new age outlaws and the road warriors. Road warriors didn't want [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3370.44s)]
*  to do it. They wanted to work with us. We just shot an angle with them on TV where we beat the [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3374.76s)]
*  shit out of it. We shaved Hawks, Mohawk off and all this stuff. They thought, road warriors thought [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3380.12s)]
*  they were getting into a storyline with DX. What we did was as soon as we started to get the heat, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3385.3199999999997s)]
*  we let Billy and Road Dog do it and we kind of stood off to the side and they did all the big [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3389.64s)]
*  damage and they ended up, road warriors ended up in a program with them, which they didn't want to [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3396.04s)]
*  be in. Right. We just, we just backed out of it. So we had had those guys associated with us, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3399.56s)]
*  but not with us. Sean gets injured. Sean goes to WrestleMania, which is like this nightmare. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3407.56s)]
*  At that point in time, Sean also was legendary drug problems and all this stuff. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3414.36s)]
*  But now Sean goes away and I think a lot of people thought that was it. I'm done. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3420.2s)]
*  I'm never going to get past where I am, whatever. We talked about, let me take the helm. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3427.64s)]
*  And what is your pitch? Sort of let's do the same group, but let me take the helm. Let's bring in [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3437.32s)]
*  Billy and Road Dog, the New Age Outlaws, which were kind of over on their own now. Let's put them [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3443.08s)]
*  in it. We'll reform DX and X-Pac whose contract he was in WCW. He was bringing him back over. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3449.8s)]
*  His contract was up and he couldn't, he was dying to get out of there because at that point, [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3455.88s)]
*  they were pretty fucked up, the whole group. So he left, the timing was perfect. So he just [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3459.6400000000003s)]
*  signed with us. He popped over. So the night after WrestleMania, whatever it is, I go out there and [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3465.88s)]
*  I cut a promo basically on Sean saying like, you told me Tyson was good. He wasn't. You told me you [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3471.1600000000003s)]
*  had this. Don't worry about it, kid. And you didn't, you know, like it was a problem. Well, [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3477.1600000000003s)]
*  you're out. I'm in. So now- So you act as if you kick him out of the group. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3482.52s)]
*  Yeah. Now I'm taking the fucking lead. So now what do you do if you need to start an army? [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3487.32s)]
*  You go find your soldiers. You go find your blood. You find your soldiers. I bring in the new age [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3492.6s)]
*  outlaws. I bring in kid and- Are you scared at all? Are you like maybe, is there like, [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3497.08s)]
*  what is that called? Imposter syndrome happening at all? Fuck yeah. Where you're like, they only [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3502.36s)]
*  like Sean. Well, it's the, you know, everybody else is saying this isn't going to work. There's [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3505.48s)]
*  a lot of people, this isn't going to work. It's not going to work. He doesn't have it. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3510.44s)]
*  Those other guys are, they don't have it. Like it's not going to work. It's Sean was the glue. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3515.48s)]
*  Sean was the key. Sean was this. So what makes it work? We made it work. Cause it, some people [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3519.48s)]
*  would say did it got even bigger? It got even bigger. Okay. It did. It got even bigger. And [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3525.2400000000002s)]
*  that was the thing. So the, the, at that point, you know, and we still have China with me, which [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3530.84s)]
*  she was a glue to that thing, but, um, sort of in that, in that realm, you know, I knew that night [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3536.04s)]
*  when I went out there to cut that promo with kid and Billy and all that stuff and restart the group, [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3544.36s)]
*  it needed to be, like I needed to go out there and hit a home run or they're going to, Vince is [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3549.08s)]
*  very quickly going to go, everybody's right. And move on. Cause he's believing in it. And he wants [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3553.24s)]
*  to see it work. So he's given me the ball. Um, and we just went out there and I, you know, my opinion, [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3558.44s)]
*  we knocked it out of the park and then they went with it and the rest is history, you know, and, [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3565.64s)]
*  um, it was, it was set up well. And you know, we, we had other people to work with nation. The [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3570.52s)]
*  domination was coming up at that point in time with rock and all that stuff. So we had all these [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3575.4s)]
*  other people to work with and it just, it took off and, and, uh, we would just do the crazy shit. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3579.8s)]
*  And then sort of as we, that, that version of the group started to become popular. And then we get [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3584.52s)]
*  into the WCW stuff where we go on the attack after them. And then it's just game changer. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3589.4s)]
*  So when you go on the attack, right now we're blending the worlds again. That's a real business [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3594.52s)]
*  rivalry. This is not, you know, scripted storylines here. This is you guys are beefing and you are [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3599.48s)]
*  attacking their brand. And at this point is Vince completely on with having to blend the worlds. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3604.12s)]
*  And now wrestling is, has to be more real. Yes. And he's also into the, whatever it takes gloves [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3609.56s)]
*  are off, whatever it takes. So there's no more like protecting the old guard. The old guard is [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3616.68s)]
*  deceased. There's a moment where when we're going to do the first attack at WCW, we're going to go, [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3621.64s)]
*  cause what they were doing was if we were going into an arena, they would book, they would book [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3627.08s)]
*  one of their TV shows like either same time or right before ours so that our ticket sales would [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3633.24s)]
*  tank, right? Like they're booking the club down the street. And that was what was pissing us off. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3641.72s)]
*  Well, they were right down the street. It was their show. So we rolled up with the tank. And [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3648.9199999999996s)]
*  when we were getting ready to go do it, our show at that point in time, we were like, [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3655.72s)]
*  um, they were live like an hour earlier than we were. And then we were live later. Yeah. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3660.7599999999998s)]
*  So we go there early, we shoot this stuff and we bring it back. And before we leave, um, [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3669.0s)]
*  we're all standing in a group because the only one that knew about this prior to us doing it was me. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3676.2s)]
*  I was on a call with Vince and a few other guys on the writing team. Um, Billy and dog and kid [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3680.44s)]
*  didn't know anything about it. They came to me like, see a military shit logo on it. Like [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3687.64s)]
*  what the fuck are we doing? And I was like, dude, I can't tell you yet. Vince wants to tell you [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3693.96s)]
*  guys, but I'm telling it's fucking bad. And, um, it all stemmed off of a phone call where we were [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3697.3199999999997s)]
*  on and they were like down the road and Vince was pissed. And on that phone call was said like, [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3704.12s)]
*  we're trying not fucking like to drive a tank down there and just fucking go nuts. And he was like, [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3708.92s)]
*  I don't know. Why don't we do that? Right. And, um, but anyway, so somebody says when we get, [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3713.56s)]
*  we're in the back end, getting ready to go. And they were like, look, we're going to go down there [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3719.9599999999996s)]
*  and do this early, but we're not on the air yet. What if they finished their show and they send a [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3722.52s)]
*  truckload of guys down here to our show? Like we probably should get extra security and have this [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3726.52s)]
*  all beefed up so they can't. And Vince goes, why? He goes, if they, if they roll up with a truck [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3732.2s)]
*  full of wrestlers here, he goes, open the fucking door up and let them in. What show you're going [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3737.3199999999997s)]
*  to watch the one with no wrestlers on it with all the wrestlers on it. And I was like, this, [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3741.24s)]
*  this is why we're going to win. Yeah. Yeah. And because what they did when we got there, [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3746.52s)]
*  we tried to go in their building down the ramp and they put the door down and they stopped this. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3751.08s)]
*  And you're filming this whole time. We're filming the whole time banging on the door. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3756.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. You're supposed to just want to let us in. Yeah. Now they look scared. Yeah. You weren't [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3759.56s)]
*  worried at all. Shit getting real because like you're hurting their business, their industry. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3763.9599999999996s)]
*  It could, it could. Like we had, this is so stupid. We had like a whole contingency plan of where like, [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3769.56s)]
*  if they come out, if somebody touches one of us, we had like a fake camera and a real camera. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3776.44s)]
*  If somebody touches one of us, I'm going to go down and because they'll come at me first, [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3783.88s)]
*  I'm going to make such a commotion that everybody will look to me, switch out the cameras, take the [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3788.7599999999998s)]
*  real tape and get the fuck out of here. So you destroy the camera, you smash it, do something, [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3794.76s)]
*  whatever they destroy, it doesn't matter. I do whatever I got to do. But, but. So you're [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3800.5200000000004s)]
*  willing to get your ass beat. Yeah. But the wrestlers aren't going to, okay. All right. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3805.8s)]
*  Everybody will talk shit and stuff like that, but for the most part, they know the business too. Yeah. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3810.1200000000003s)]
*  And so what's funny is we're outside doing this. Kevin Nash is coming back from the gym with Lex [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3813.5600000000004s)]
*  Luger and he like looks at me. He's like, somebody's got a tank up right inside of the business, [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3818.44s)]
*  which really just the Jeep with the canner on it. He's like, it's all sewn on. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3822.6s)]
*  So you call it a tank. Yeah. It's a wrangler. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3827.0s)]
*  It has become a tank over the years, but it was never a tank. Yeah. And, but Kevin said he's like [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3832.12s)]
*  stuck in traffic. They're coming back from the gym and now he like pokes his head out the sunroof [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3837.7999999999997s)]
*  and he's like, it looks like Hunter. What are they doing? You know, so he goes in the building now [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3841.24s)]
*  and they used to call their production office, the war room. Yeah. And Kevin goes in the war room [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3846.76s)]
*  and he said, like, they're all in there talking about the show and stuff. And he goes, he's like [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3853.6400000000003s)]
*  looking around the room and he goes, none of you guys are concerned with what's going on outside. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3856.76s)]
*  And they're like, what are you talking about? And he goes, DX outside the building, [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3861.7200000000003s)]
*  shooting a cannon off and with a loud horn and thousands of fans all around them. Like none of [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3867.0s)]
*  you worried about that shit. And they were like, what? You know, that's how they got informed of [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3873.24s)]
*  it. Hilarious. Wow. And then that's when we started coming down the ramp and that's when they shut [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3878.12s)]
*  them. Do you think other wrestlers in WCW knew it was over at that point? I don't know. To me, [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3881.7999999999997s)]
*  that's like, I think at that point, it's a funny thing. We were scratching and clawing. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3886.9199999999996s)]
*  I think for the most part, the guys in WCW were less concerned about the company and more [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3893.16s)]
*  concerned about, they're paying me a ton of money and I don't work much. So it's interesting. It's [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3898.8399999999997s)]
*  like the incentive structures makes you want to put other guys over. And this might also be your [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3903.08s)]
*  personality, but even when you're telling these stories, you're talking about putting other guys [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3908.7599999999998s)]
*  over, which seems like the right thing to do for the business. It's a very rare thing in a [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3912.2s)]
*  narcissistic endeavor, which is entertainment, that there's someone who's going, how else can I [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3918.52s)]
*  put these different people over? What can I do? You even talking about the different groups, right? [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3923.4s)]
*  Yeah, you're going to bring them into DX, but they're not ready once we, at this point, we'll do it. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3928.12s)]
*  WCW's incentive structure is just show up. You don't have to worry about the business at all. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3933.88s)]
*  And at that point it had started to become, it doesn't even matter if you show up. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3939.24s)]
*  Your pay is guaranteed. Oh, wow. I'm injured. So like you fast forward, not long after that, [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3943.88s)]
*  because it was, this was, Austin was champ and Steve and I wrestle in Chicago at the [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3951.24s)]
*  Rosemont, which is now Allstate Arena. And then the United Center is on the other side of town, [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3957.24s)]
*  right? They were at the United Center the week before us. Same what I'm talking about, [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3961.56s)]
*  them booking, right? We had booked Rosemont. They booked United Center like the week before us. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3965.96s)]
*  Steve and I wrestle in a main event that night. We probably went like 40 minutes. We like, [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3971.96s)]
*  we give them a full on pay-per-view like, because in the, you know, Rosemont sold out, [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3975.72s)]
*  like we're all in delivering on everything we do. And so that night we go back to hotels, [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3982.12s)]
*  a lot of fans there. And we had people telling us like, dude, you guys killed it. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3988.52s)]
*  WCW was here last week. We went to that show, like six of the top 10 guys didn't show up. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3993.72s)]
*  You know, the main event was Goldberg versus Big Show, Big Show, I mean, the giant at the time. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=3999.32s)]
*  Giant walked out smoking a cigarette. They got in the ring. Goldberg kicked him in the gut, [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4004.6s)]
*  gave him the suplex and the whole match was like 15 seconds. They just didn't, they didn't care. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4010.28s)]
*  Right. We were fighting tooth and nail, like we're turning this thing around and they didn't care. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4017.32s)]
*  And they were just, they were phoning it in. And I think at that point, [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4024.36s)]
*  shit was so miserable backstage that they were just, they were phoning it in. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4027.4s)]
*  And that's, you know, that's the difference, right? Like at the end of the day. So, [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4032.28s)]
*  you know, we were getting to a place where at that point, [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4036.84s)]
*  this might take a little time, but we're going to win this. We'll crush these guys. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4042.76s)]
*  Wow. I wanted to ask about character development. Like you've mentioned a few different wrestlers [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4046.36s)]
*  that, you know, you've kind of been like, oh yeah, their gimmick at that time wasn't that good. And [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4051.0s)]
*  even in your own career, there's so many different iterations before we get to Triple H, the character [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4054.92s)]
*  that we know now. So I'm curious, how do you develop a wrestling character, find the wrestling [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4060.6800000000003s)]
*  voice, the gimmicks that work? And if a young wrestler came to you today, like, hey, here's [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4065.88s)]
*  how I want to develop. Like, what advice would you give them? It's part of the difficult aspect of [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4070.52s)]
*  what we do is you teach somebody to do the moves. You can teach them when to do them. You can kind [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4075.24s)]
*  of teach them crowd psychology, but the charisma and who you are, your character, it's like, [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4080.52s)]
*  you know, in comedy, everybody's got like, not everybody, some people just very funny. Other [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4086.8399999999997s)]
*  people have to have a shtick, right? And a gimmick of what they are. And no one can really tell you, [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4091.64s)]
*  like, hey, you know, like when I was a kid, Bobcat, Gulfway was like a big thing. But he's like, [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4101.0s)]
*  crazy voice and all that shit. Like nobody could go to him and go, you know what you should do? [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4105.48s)]
*  This will work. You should do is you should do to affect your voice and do all this crazy [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4108.68s)]
*  sht and stuff like that, right? That was just him. It's really hard to tell somebody how [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4112.28s)]
*  to go do their thing. For us, as we were pulling into the attitude era, I say this a lot, [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4117.72s)]
*  I say this a lot. Taker used to say to me all the time, as we got to be friends, he would, [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4125.160000000001s)]
*  like we'd go out or whatever. And then, you know, end of the night, he'd almost always say to me, [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4131.400000000001s)]
*  dude, when you figure out how to be yourself on camera, you're going to make a fortune. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4135.96s)]
*  And I would always think to him, what the fuck does that mean? [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4140.4400000000005s)]
*  Is this while you're wearing the writing pants and you have the bow in your hair? [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4142.68s)]
*  Some of it. Yeah. But when you, when, when you, even then after, right, when we start to, [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4146.52s)]
*  like that was kind of the him saying like, like DX was way more us, but I still wasn't fully like, [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4152.4400000000005s)]
*  I was trying to get out of the Hunterhurst Helmsley stuff. I didn't feel like it was [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4160.52s)]
*  right for me just to one day stop and be something totally different. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4165.56s)]
*  You have to build to it. Yeah. So when we get to the end of DX, [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4168.68s)]
*  the run as baby faces, there's a moment where I go to Vince and I'm like, I want to go to the group. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4172.839999999999s)]
*  And he was like, why? I said, I want to turn heel. Austin is white hot. Rock is on his way up, [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4183.639999999999s)]
*  but he's going to be a baby face, a white made baby face. Like there's no, [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4190.839999999999s)]
*  So you felt it early on. He's so charismatic. There's no way he doesn't become [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4195.0s)]
*  that baby face that we need the Darth Vader in this, right? You got, you got two good guys. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4199.88s)]
*  This is so smart. You need the bad guy. I can, I'm confident enough in myself. I can be that bad guy, [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4206.84s)]
*  but I got to get out of this group and I got to make the shift. Now that you're the other guys [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4213.64s)]
*  were like, what do you do? Yep. Yep. Because you also white hot. You're like, why would you leave [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4217.48s)]
*  this? Yeah. Don't ride this into the ground. We're making a fortune on merch and everything else. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4221.96s)]
*  Don't do this. Like don't do it. I was like, but this is not what I want to do. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4226.280000000001s)]
*  So how, how, because you understand the only way that you're going to get those big main events [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4230.76s)]
*  and then maybe get the belt is that you have to play something opposite that is super white hot [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4234.92s)]
*  right now. It's not even necessarily, obviously everybody wants to be champion at some point in [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4239.64s)]
*  their career or something like that, but it's not even about that. It's about being on top. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4244.76s)]
*  Yeah. Right. Like you don't have to be champion. You just got to, how do you break through to be [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4248.4400000000005s)]
*  like the undertaker, one of the guys, you know, and that where your shit resonates and sticks [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4253.56s)]
*  and stays generationally and all that stuff. Like, how do you get into that place? And I knew for me, [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4261.4800000000005s)]
*  it wasn't, while what we were doing was amazing, that wasn't, that wasn't the setup for me. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4268.280000000001s)]
*  When I leave the group, now it's a full transition. Now I go to trunks. Now I take my hair down. I wet [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4274.92s)]
*  my hair. I start growing a beard a little bit. Like I start to grow. Now I become what I always [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4280.44s)]
*  envisioned myself being as a performer. And I sort of realized like takers words were when you can be [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4285.48s)]
*  yourself, when you can just go out there and be authentic, but the hardest thing in the world to [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4293.0s)]
*  do when a red light is on you and there's 10,000 people there is go out and just be you. Cause it's [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4298.28s)]
*  if you fail as you, if you fail as you and it's, it's so, um, it's a scary proposition. And you're [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4305.16s)]
*  naked out there. Yeah. Characters like a security blanket. Of course, if you don't like that, you [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4314.12s)]
*  don't like, if they hate the character, they hate the character. They don't hate you. Yes. When you [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4317.8s)]
*  start being yourself. 100%. And so that, you know, and that's still even then that becomes a [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4321.0s)]
*  transition of getting there over time. But it's, it's, it's a scary proposition, but I was all in [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4326.6s)]
*  on, I want to take that gamble and I want to see if I can get to be that guy. Okay. How many other [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4334.44s)]
*  wrestlers, and now that you're the boss, understand the game like you understood it at that time and [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4338.839999999999s)]
*  are coming to you and asking similar questions. So there's a lot of people that do. I just had [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4344.839999999999s)]
*  this conversation with Sean and this will piss off everybody. I sent this conversation with Sean [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4352.2s)]
*  and I had to take her as well within the last year, because we were talking about like people [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4358.12s)]
*  helping to guide the business into the next generation and, and writing and storytelling [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4367.4s)]
*  and all that stuff. And I said it to Sean first, I said, Sean, think about your career, everybody [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4372.599999999999s)]
*  that you've run up against in your career, how many people would you say absolutely 100% get it? [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4380.2s)]
*  Not a portion of it, not a piece of it, like get it, get the modes of storytelling, get the, [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4388.2s)]
*  how to get the most out of something, get, get all aspects of what we do. How many people would you [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4395.0s)]
*  say? And he was like, well, I'm well, I bet you I could count them on one hand. Right. And that's, [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4400.76s)]
*  that's considering greats in our business, all that stuff. And he's like, I bet you I could count [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4407.5599999999995s)]
*  on one hand. I said, I think it would be a struggle to fill up all the fingers on one hand. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4412.28s)]
*  Really? Wow. Right. Like, it's a different thing. And people don't get it, the amount of factors [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4416.76s)]
*  that go into creating something, getting a character, doing all those things. And then [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4425.4800000000005s)]
*  it's easy to look at it. And this is all stuff that I learned over, you know, 25 years. What are [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4432.84s)]
*  they? What are they? Break it down. Like, it's, it's, it's so many things, it's hard to even [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4438.2s)]
*  put into context because like, every, everything matters. So why don't you just do this with this [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4442.28s)]
*  guy? This would get him over. Well, you can't do this at this time because this guy is doing this [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4449.0s)]
*  and this doesn't work with that. And this guy got injured and that takes away from this. Oh, by the [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4454.04s)]
*  way, they hate each other. They won't work together. It won't be good. These factors don't work. I'm [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4458.84s)]
*  also getting pressure from the network to do this and I don't have this and we can't do that time [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4463.48s)]
*  wise. Right. There's all these factors of you're building out this elaborate set of dominoes [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4468.04s)]
*  set up. And then if one of them comes out, you start all over, they can say all affect each other, [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4475.56s)]
*  you know, and you don't think about it that way. So the amount of thought and being able to see [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4482.2s)]
*  ahead of what's going to happen next is incredibly difficult. And that doesn't mean you're right all [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4489.4s)]
*  the time. It doesn't mean that at all. You can be wrong. You can understand all that, still be [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4495.48s)]
*  wrong 80% of the time, you know, whatever, but it's, it's the feel. Pat Patterson was one of the [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4500.919999999999s)]
*  greatest Finnish guys in our business. And, you know, the generation that was just slightly before [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4507.4s)]
*  me of talent that came in when I first came in was all like, you know, as they're teaching you [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4512.28s)]
*  things, let me teach you something here. I learned this from Pat, right? But I was fortunate enough to [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4516.36s)]
*  sit under learning tree. That was Vince. And when I say learning tree, I mean, the things of what to [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4523.56s)]
*  do and what not to do. Right. I was fortunate enough to sit around Pat where when Pat was there, [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4527.8s)]
*  every day when we'd finish a production meeting, Pat would be like, what are you going to do? I'm [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4536.200000000001s)]
*  going to get something. You want to meet me in the stands? We'll talk about this show. We'd start [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4540.68s)]
*  putting together and like, I'm learning all these from all these people. And, you know, Pat would [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4544.68s)]
*  always say the wrestling business isn't here. It's here. Right. And he was the first one to say that [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4550.6s)]
*  to me would be like, think about everybody, you know, in the business, how many people feel it here? [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4556.52s)]
*  Not many. It comes out of here, but the guys that really feel he's like this, they're few and far [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4561.88s)]
*  between. I imagine those are the guys that have the greatest longevity in the business. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4568.280000000001s)]
*  It is, it is because they can feel when the ebb and flow and change and move and do all those things. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4572.120000000001s)]
*  And Pat would say to me all the time, there's a lot of guys here that are amazing. They don't feel [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4577.56s)]
*  they don't, this isn't, this isn't where it comes from, from them. And he, the first time he told me [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4582.200000000001s)]
*  that, he said, you feel it. So you get this feeling, you're like, I can be one of those guys. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4587.88s)]
*  This is my pathway to being one of those guys. How do you set that story in motion? You can't just go, [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4593.56s)]
*  I'm leaving the group. There needs to be a reason to leave the group. So it's a little convoluted at [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4598.76s)]
*  the time, right? In that, in that moment in time, like I sort of Vince has, Vince has now become a [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4602.92s)]
*  full-on character. He's got a faction called the corporation. I turn on DX to go with the corporation, [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4609.08s)]
*  but the corporation's like this hodgepodge of all these different people and it kind of really [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4615.16s)]
*  doesn't work out well. It just becomes this mess of stuff. So you're just trying to navigate. It's like, [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4619.08s)]
*  I pop out of this thing that's working and I pop over here, but now I've, it's like going back. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4626.28s)]
*  A lot of times people think that that stuff like you're, you're here. So then you move into [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4631.64s)]
*  something else and you just go here. You might have to take a step back. Very rarely works that way. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4636.200000000001s)]
*  You're here and I want to get here, but I'm over here. You've got to go here and then climb back up [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4640.12s)]
*  to that. Sometimes it can work where you go right there, but more times than not, I feel like whenever [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4647.240000000001s)]
*  there's a, a complete shift in what you do, you go back and start over at the beginning. Is this [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4653.0s)]
*  Stephanie storyline? This comes into it a little bit later. So which is the Stephanie one? [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4660.04s)]
*  The Steph storyline. Okay. So you're already there. So I sort of get the opportunity. I'm, [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4666.12s)]
*  I'm put in that position where I'm, I'm world champion. You know, this is at a point in time [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4671.24s)]
*  where they're, they're flipping titles around a lot too. It's just different time in the business, [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4678.92s)]
*  but I'm in that sort of mix where I'm being seen in the, the Austin rock conversation, [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4684.52s)]
*  the taker conversation. I'm in that mix. I've been, I've been champ. I can't remember if I [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4689.16s)]
*  was champ once or twice at that point in time, but, but I'm champ and Steph, it's a, it's a funny [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4693.96s)]
*  thing because people's thoughts about how this happened are different. I have this really strong [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4700.68s)]
*  creative relationship with Vince. I know he has a daughter, but I don't, I've never even really met [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4709.08s)]
*  her. And then she starts to be around the company, but I'm not working with her much or anything like [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4714.12s)]
*  that, but she's in a storyline with another wrestler, this guy Tess and they are engaged [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4718.44s)]
*  to be married. The lead writer at the time, he leaves, he leaves the company in the middle of [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4725.0s)]
*  this. And you know, I've heard him say that he knew exactly where the storyline was going. Just [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4731.48s)]
*  nobody else did. So when he leaves, there's like this giant gap where like Vince's daughter's [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4737.0s)]
*  engaged with this guy. To be honest, I hadn't even been paying that much attention to that storyline. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4744.44s)]
*  It's just concerned about shit more often. Right. But, and I had a great creative relationship with [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4748.839999999999s)]
*  Vince, but so they so don't know where to go with this thing that they've announced this wedding's [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4753.719999999999s)]
*  going to be on TV. They have to do a thing where she gets hit in the head with a garbage can and [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4758.919999999999s)]
*  loses her memory and doesn't remember who the fiance is to just to buy some time. Right. So [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4763.4s)]
*  they can try to figure out how to get out of this thing. But there's going to be a wedding on raw. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4768.5199999999995s)]
*  Yes. And everybody's, were they, were they involved in real life? No, no, no. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4774.76s)]
*  Oh, okay. It's just, were you guys at the time involved at all? I didn't even really know. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4780.28s)]
*  Nothing. Yeah. Yeah. But so I know they're trying to figure out a way to get out of this wedding [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4784.12s)]
*  thing. And meanwhile, I'm in a storyline with Vince where Vince has made it like he is a baby [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4788.92s)]
*  face at this time. Right. He is. And he has said like, I can never have another chance at the title. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4796.6s)]
*  He's so pissed off at me. He bans me from getting world title shots. And so we're in the middle of [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4802.12s)]
*  the storyline. So one day I go to him and I'm like, this is thinking about our shit, right? Like, [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4807.5599999999995s)]
*  and how do we get back to getting me in that mix after what we've done? And he's like, yeah, I don't [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4813.48s)]
*  know. I'm thinking about that too. And I'm like, the thing with Steph, I said, well, what if she, [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4818.44s)]
*  right before she's going to get married, she has a bachelorette party, blow it out like some big [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4825.24s)]
*  story on TV. She has a bachelorette party, but I show up and I'm, you know, it's a different [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4829.56s)]
*  timeframe. I'm making your drink. And while she's unconscious, I said, you have it in Vegas. I drive [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4833.8s)]
*  her through one of those wedding chapel things. I end up like, nobody knows about this, but I've [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4840.04s)]
*  filmed all of it. And now when the wedding happens, right when they say, speak now, forever hold your [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4845.4800000000005s)]
*  peace, I come out and I'm like, hold on a second. She can't marry him because she's married to me. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4850.200000000001s)]
*  And I show the footage and holy shit, I've ruined your life. And now we create this storyline where [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4853.56s)]
*  if in order to get your daughter like this wedding annulled and so she can marry the other guy, [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4858.92s)]
*  you and I have to fight. And if I beat you, I get the world title shot. If you beat me, [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4864.92s)]
*  I annul the wedding. And he's like, God damn, I love it. So that's what we do. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4869.72s)]
*  And this starts Steph and I now. So originally it's just supposed to be a one-off thing. We'd [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4875.72s)]
*  shoot the video in Vegas. Yeah. And the video is hilarious when you are mouth-biting. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4882.36s)]
*  You can't get this video. It's so ridiculous. You're going, I do. Yeah. It's utterly ridiculous, [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4888.599999999999s)]
*  but it just works, right? And this is the footage of me out there telling this story. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4897.48s)]
*  So originally it's supposed to be just this one-off. Look at Steph Sellen. She's a beast. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4902.76s)]
*  So it's supposed to be this one-off thing that makes us have the match. I go over, I get my world [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4908.84s)]
*  title shot. She moves on, does the rest of the stuff with the testing, but at least gets them [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4915.32s)]
*  out of the wedding. Right. And now it's the decision whether he's going to marry or not. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4918.84s)]
*  The first time she goes on TV after this happens, like this is the cynical world we live in. She [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4923.719999999999s)]
*  goes out on TV and I'm sitting at gorilla position next to Vince, where we run the show from. And [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4929.96s)]
*  like, I'm not working. I'm in the show. Like at this point, I'm just still a character. I'm [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4935.32s)]
*  helping out heavy with creative and helping produce stuff, but I'm really just as a character [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4941.16s)]
*  on TV. And she goes out to cut the promo and I'm sitting next to Vince and she goes out there and [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4945.639999999999s)]

*  yeah, to be this sympathetic baby face and all this stuff. And Vince taps me and he's like, [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4963.16s)]
*  Hey, this is so good. 20,000 people call your daughter a slut. Yeah. This is money. Right. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4967.96s)]
*  Yeah. And sorry, what are you thinking in that moment? I'm a little bit like, like, [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=4978.36s)]

*  just trying to get to my storyline with Vince and we throw this thing out there and there's [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5000.36s)]
*  legs on it. And now we're like, Holy cow. So then, you know, the next week she goes out there as [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5004.44s)]
*  well, all this stuff. So then Vince comes to me and he's like, what if she, like one of the worst [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5009.24s)]
*  possible thing happens is like, she turns on me. We have this match at pay-per-view right at the [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5014.76s)]
*  moment in time where, Holy shit, Vince might actually do this and beat Triple H and who turns [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5021.08s)]
*  on him, but his own daughter to join his worst enemy in the moment of time. Yeah. And she comes [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5025.48s)]
*  with me and he, like, he pitches it to me and he's like, and then like, I, I'm so distraught. My world [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5033.32s)]
*  is so turned upside down. I leave, I leave for a while and you guys run the show. Like, as like the, [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5038.839999999999s)]

*  out of control firing people and just whatever, you know, and that's kind of starts to think. But [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5059.639999999999s)]
*  so as this happens, like, I don't know, Steph at all, sort of. Sort of. Yeah. Well, I don't, [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5064.919999999999s)]

*  But I, but I don't, and the thing is she's a sponge for the business, right? Like Steph is like, [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5077.08s)]
*  she wants nothing but to be in this business. Right. Right. So. So issue, sorry. Have you talked [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5089.8s)]
*  her about that moment and what she was feeling? Is she like her dad where she's like, she's thinking [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5094.92s)]
*  the same shit or is she like this? So she knows the game. Yeah. She's like, oh my God, this is the [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5099.5599999999995s)]
*  greatest thing ever. Like they're pulling the shit out of me. Like, you know, she's very savvy. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5103.48s)]
*  Yeah. And she's one of the few people, and I would say this as well. And people will think, [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5107.0s)]
*  oh, it's your wife. When I, when I make that small list of people on one hand, she get it. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5112.919999999999s)]
*  She's one of them. All right, guys, let's take a break for a second. Okay. Shout out David. I don't [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5118.5199999999995s)]
*  even know who David is, but he made the best protein bar that I've ever had in my entire life. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5123.08s)]
*  What do you want out of a protein bar? Okay. Bare minimum, you want there to be protein in it and [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5127.639999999999s)]
*  you don't want it to be too fattening. Well, David has figured out this way to put 28 grams of protein [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5131.72s)]
*  into a bar with only 150 calories and zero grams of sugar. I don't know how that's possible. I'm [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5138.68s)]
*  not going to ask questions. It's absolutely phenomenal. Okay. Now you would think with that [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5143.96s)]
*  amount of protein, it's going to taste like shit. No, this is the best tasting protein bar I've ever [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5148.92s)]
*  had. So the protein bar that has the most protein for the least amount of calories and the best [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5153.88s)]
*  taste there. We don't need any other protein bars. It's done. You just, it's David. And then that's [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5159.56s)]
*  it. Why would you waste? Why would you have something that has less protein and tastes worse and is [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5164.76s)]
*  worse for you? Why would you even put that in your body if you're consuming it so you can get [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5170.200000000001s)]
*  absolutely shredded? David has the most protein per calorie telling you right now. Okay. It's also [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5174.84s)]
*  available in stores and NYC. So you're a friend. If you're in New York, you stop by your local bodega, [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5181.8s)]

*  It's how he talks. Are you riffing? You're feeling the audience and going for it? I didn't even think [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5262.44s)]
*  about that line before I got out there. And I was like, oh, I got to say something about, you know, [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5268.759999999999s)]

*  do you see an eyebrow raise or anything? No, I mean, he reacts in the ring, but like he's so good. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5283.639999999999s)]

*  story. You know, like a fire McFauley, and I end up in a match with him and then get him retired and [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5315.08s)]

*  Right. I don't know this at the time, but Steph's mom says to her, like, what's the deal with you [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5362.2s)]
*  and Triple H? And she's like, what are you talking about? It's one of the boys, nothing. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5368.5199999999995s)]
*  And she's like, I don't know. I see it in your eyes, the way you're looking at it and stuff like [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5373.4s)]
*  that. Like, you sure there's not something that, you know, like my mom, her mom both see it on TV, [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5377.8s)]
*  but neither one of us. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5382.84s)]
*  Dad got no clue. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5383.88s)]
*  Steph will say this and I say this. I believe he started to see it and I believe he actually [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5389.24s)]
*  liked it and was trying to push us at that point. And then there comes a time when we do get together [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5395.16s)]
*  and then there's a time when he takes that away. Like it's going to cause too much problem in the [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5402.92s)]
*  business and you guys can't, you can't, can't see each other. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5406.36s)]
*  Even though you guys are already seeing each other at the time. So he, so now the people know, [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5411.8s)]
*  do people know in the real world that you guys are seeing each other at this point? [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5416.12s)]
*  Yeah, I don't, I'm not like, I don't remember the exact timing of it, but yeah, [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5419.4s)]
*  they're starting to sort of get it. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5422.68s)]
*  And then how, what's the storyline for tearing you guys apart? [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5424.36s)]
*  Well, there isn't, we're still in a storyline together, but he's just saying personally, [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5426.92s)]
*  put the cat on the outside. You got it. You guys can't, you can't do this. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5430.839999999999s)]
*  And did you guys listen as good obedient soldiers? [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5435.16s)]
*  We tried and then it just, you know, like when you get one something, you guys gotta go get it. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5437.719999999999s)]
*  Right. And so we try and I honestly think at that point, like, you know, as you asked earlier, [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5442.759999999999s)]
*  like, is he just saying this to try to see what you'll do? I believe there's a lot. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5449.16s)]
*  Then he was like, no, you guys can't see each other. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5454.679999999999s)]
*  Let's see if he really likes my daughter. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5457.0s)]
*  Let's see what he's willing to go through to get it. And, you know, for me at the time, [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5458.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm, I'm sort of gambling everything on, you know, when people say like, oh, well, [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5465.96s)]
*  that's how he got to the position and all that shit. Like, nah, I'm not fucking, I'm like, [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5473.0s)]
*  I'm gambling. If this doesn't work out, I'm fucked. Like I'm done. But at the same point [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5477.96s)]
*  time, it's like, you know, when you meet the right person, you gotta go for it. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5482.92s)]
*  You meet the right person and yeah, it becomes this, [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5486.6s)]
*  yeah, it's just this crazy time. So we're kind of doing this shit on TV and, you know, and, [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5492.12s)]
*  and now everybody's attitude towards me is changing. Well, I'm already sort of, you know, [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5497.72s)]
*  I'm going to production meetings before this ever happens. I'm going to production meetings. I'm [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5505.0s)]
*  creative. I'm having creative input with Vince. I'm, you know, people see me all day long. I'm [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5509.64s)]
*  with Pat Patterson talking over finishes and helping with their shit, which they don't [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5516.200000000001s)]
*  necessarily see as a good or bad thing, but like they just see, so there's a lot of, [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5521.400000000001s)]
*  whether it's jealousy or whatever that is. Right now, when the rumor starts that, hey, [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5526.12s)]
*  he's, he might be seeing Steph. That's a whole fucking different ball game of, [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5531.56s)]
*  So you're saying other wrestlers were starting to get jealous. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5537.08s)]
*  I don't know if jealous is the right word, but I have a mega heat. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5540.120000000001s)]
*  I think the perception, if I'm an insecure entertainer is, which I am, he's trying to [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5543.160000000001s)]
*  weasel his way into. I'm trying to get with Vince's daughter so that you can be the guy. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5547.88s)]
*  Okay. So you were a character, but how did you start having so much influence in the creative? [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5553.72s)]
*  Like when did they tap you? So, so as I was saying a little bit ago, the guy that's going to leave, [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5558.68s)]
*  the creative guy that's going to leave. So at that point in time, I was already having, [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5563.16s)]
*  I was talking a lot with Vince. Sean and I would talk a lot with Vince on the phone about creative [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5567.5599999999995s)]
*  directions and he'd ask our opinions about different things here and there. And so I already [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5573.5599999999995s)]
*  had that relationship. Sean gets hurt, goes away. Shortly thereafter, the other writer leaves. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5578.76s)]
*  When he leaves, I go to Vince and say, I just remember the TV that we were at where the guy [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5585.72s)]
*  left that day just didn't show up that day. He goes work for WCW. And as we're getting ready to [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5591.88s)]
*  leave the show, I go to Vince and I say, Hey, man, I know how hard this creative shit is. And when [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5597.72s)]
*  you're trying to do it by yourself with nobody to bounce shit off of, I can't imagine how hard that [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5603.0s)]
*  is. And he just left you high and dry. I said that that we were done that show. I was going home for [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5607.400000000001s)]
*  like three or four days. We would do like 18 day loops on the road or 10 day loops, and then go [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5611.96s)]
*  home for three or four and then back out on the road for another 18 or whatever. So I was getting [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5616.6s)]
*  ready to leave to go home for like three or four days. And I said to Vince, I said, I know how [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5622.120000000001s)]
*  difficult that's going to be. I said, I ain't got shit going on. I didn't have a girlfriend or [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5627.72s)]
*  whatever. I was just going home. And I said, if you need to bounce, I said, I don't, whatever it's [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5632.120000000001s)]
*  worth. If you need to bounce some ideas off somebody, I'm going to be home. And I sort of [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5639.240000000001s)]
*  almost was after I left, I was like, that was stupid. I don't know. I should have said that [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5643.88s)]
*  it was kind of embarrassing. Like, like he needs my fucking help. But I said it and left. And then [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5648.04s)]
*  I went home and like, I don't know, it was like the next day or day after something like that, [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5653.64s)]
*  you know, home, my phone rings and it's his office and agents like talk to you. And I get on the [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5657.72s)]
*  phone with him. He's like, Hey, the other day you said, if I needed to bounce some shit off somebody [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5662.76s)]
*  and you know, you were home, you got any time right now? I was like, yeah. What does he hit you with? [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5667.24s)]
*  He just started hitting me with creative stuff. Hey, we're thinking about doing this in the show. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5673.48s)]
*  And it wasn't my shit. It was just general creative. It was just asking me my opinion. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5676.599999999999s)]
*  And then, but by this point, you've already proved to him that you look out for the business. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5681.5599999999995s)]
*  You're trying to put other people on. I think so. And I think he also just sees like, [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5685.08s)]
*  for whatever reason, I have a knack for the understanding. I see the bigger picture. Yeah. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5689.48s)]
*  And you are the game. Yeah, I guess. And then, so then shortly thereafter, he comes to me and he's [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5693.639999999999s)]
*  like, Hey, what do you think about coming to the production meetings at TV? Like when we get to [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5700.04s)]
*  TV, come into production meetings. And I was like, I mean, if you want me to, and he was like, [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5705.0s)]
*  look, it's a pain in the ass. You know, like call time for a talent might be one o'clock [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5709.72s)]
*  production meeting might be a 10 o'clock. So now you're there all night. We're coming from another [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5713.64s)]
*  town, right? So if I'm, if I'm driving five hours from the other town to get to this town, [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5717.56s)]
*  now I gotta be there at 10 AM, not one, right? So different world. He's like, I understand that'll [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5724.28s)]
*  be tough, but I'd love to have your input in there. And I'm like, okay. So to me, like I'm like, [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5729.08s)]
*  if he's opening that door, I'm not turning that down. So, you know, I'd ride over to the next [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5735.32s)]
*  town with everybody. And then in the morning I'd be like, Hey guys, I gotta be in the building [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5739.96s)]
*  early today. I'm going to go over there at 10 o'clock. They'd show up at one. I'd already [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5744.04s)]
*  have been in the production meeting. So, and once Pat sees me now in the production meetings, [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5747.8s)]
*  I think at first they were like, why is he in there? You know, and then once we all start to [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5753.5599999999995s)]
*  get into it, Vince is really good when he wanted to like include you in shit. So we'd be in the [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5757.96s)]
*  production meeting and he'd be like, what do you think? Me? Oh, [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5763.16s)]
*  Do you remember the first thing you pitched? I don't, but I, you know, I just give my opinion [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5767.32s)]
*  or whatever. And I'm sure I came across as fucking to everybody else egotistic. What the fuck does he [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5771.64s)]
*  know? Probably said a bunch of stupid, really stupid shit, but it was enough for him to say like, [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5776.2s)]
*  he's, he's contributing here. And then Pat started to sort of like, Hey, let's, you know, [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5781.16s)]
*  I got, I got these finishes. I gotta go over. You want to come help me with those? [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5787.16s)]
*  Did it make you a better wrestler being involved in the production side? [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5790.76s)]
*  Yeah. Because all the shit that you don't, you just think about your side of it. And then you [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5793.48s)]
*  don't think about all the other side of it and the things that need to happen or how they're shot or [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5798.04s)]
*  camera angles or how they're thinking about this and really what's important. Oh, this is important. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5804.28s)]
*  It's not even about me in that moment in time. I just need to be small over there and not be seen. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5808.76s)]
*  That needs to be the big focus. You just think totally. It's a 360 approach. Yeah. As opposed [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5812.92s)]
*  to just a little slice. Yeah. Your little slice is different than all of it. Timing wise, is this [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5820.12s)]
*  before quad injury? Oh yeah. Okay. Yeah. That doesn't, that my quad injury is like 2000. It's [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5827.4s)]
*  just so funny the lore around you because like, as I'm doing research, there's different stories. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5833.32s)]
*  One story is during the quad injury, you cozy up to Vince and that's where you really start [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5838.28s)]
*  to soak up the game, but you were already doing it prior. Oh, long before that. Long before that. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5843.16s)]
*  So my quad injury happens 2001 and I completely, my left quad completely like exploded, right? [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5848.5199999999995s)]
*  My capsule exploded, everything. So when I get to Birmingham where Dr. Andrews at the time is like, [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5858.44s)]
*  he is the orthopedic guy for like, you know, everybody. Right. So I go see him and you know, [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5864.84s)]
*  one of the things they tell me is like, well, when you have to surge on this right away, like [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5873.88s)]
*  he was like, I don't even know how you finish this match. Like you have nothing attached. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5879.64s)]
*  Like it's a, but you shouldn't even have been able to stand up. Right. And you know, we finished that [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5882.84s)]
*  match and everything. And then he's telling me like, look, there's nobody in a contact sport [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5888.6s)]
*  like this, an impact sport that's ever returned from this injury. If you do it, you'll be the [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5895.160000000001s)]
*  first one. And to this day, he still uses it as a case study. So he said, like, I'm going to put the [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5900.360000000001s)]
*  pieces back together, but whatever you can do after that is going to be on you. So I never left [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5907.400000000001s)]
*  Birmingham, Alabama for nine months. I checked into the embassy sweets hotel. I went and had my [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5913.08s)]
*  surgery. I would, I would rehab like the best, this guy, Kevin Wilkes, like the best rehab guy [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5918.52s)]
*  on the planet, especially at that time. I thought, well, if I'm going to be able to do this, I got [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5926.4400000000005s)]
*  to be with the best. So I checked into the embassy sweets hotel. I lived there for nine months. I [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5930.360000000001s)]
*  would go every day. I would go start, I'd eat breakfast at the hotel. I'd go to rehab this, [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5936.68s)]
*  the second they'd be open on, I'd roll in, I'd stay till lunch. I'd go to lunch with Kevin and [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5945.0s)]
*  those guys, the therapists. I'd come back. I'd do a second session in the afternoon when they'd get [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5950.52s)]
*  done at like five or six. I'd go to the hotel. I'd drink a shake. I'd drive to the gym. I'd have [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5955.4s)]
*  some of the van take me to the gym across the street on like a fucking wheelchair. At first, [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5960.2s)]
*  I'd go, I'd train my upper body. I'd go back to the hotel. I'd eat something. I'd watch wrestling [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5964.84s)]
*  tapes until I got tired. I'd go to sleep. I'd get up in the morning and do it again the next day. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5969.88s)]
*  I did that for nine months. Was this all on your dime or was this W.W.E.? W.W.E. covered my hotels, [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5973.88s)]
*  I'd pay for my surgery, all that stuff. That's one great thing about the company. They cover [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5979.08s)]
*  everything. But the commitment aspect of it is I didn't, I wasn't taking a chance on not coming [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5982.52s)]
*  back. Okay. So, but at that point, so I'm like, I'm not even really talking to Vince at all. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5992.6s)]
*  That's yeah. Like, so during this point, like, are you not part of creative meetings? Are you still [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=5996.68s)]
*  consulting in any way? What's up with Stephanie? Are you guys away from each other? So what happens [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6001.32s)]
*  is this kind of now puts Stephanie into a position where this is where we really start to have a [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6005.24s)]
*  relationship because, you know, she comes to see me in Birmingham. Like, obviously we have a [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6010.84s)]
*  relationship. She cares about me. I can't remember if we were at that part supposed to not be [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6015.719999999999s)]
*  together, whatever, but like I'm in Birmingham. She's coming to see me. We, yeah, that's where [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6020.04s)]
*  it all locks in. Like she's basically, whenever she has off days, she's coming down to Birmingham [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6025.16s)]
*  to spend a day or two with me, not every week, but like here and there when she can. And, [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6030.36s)]
*  you know, she helped get me through it. Okay. So real quick. So during this time, [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6035.799999999999s)]
*  my understanding is the chatter around the wrestling world while you're taking some time away [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6042.5199999999995s)]
*  is, cause you've been healed, you've been baby faced, but you've been like hated. And some of [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6048.679999999999s)]
*  the hate was so real cause you're mixing like real life and wrestling that like it turns into real [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6053.799999999999s)]
*  life hate towards you. A lot of people to some degree, to some degree. My understanding is during [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6059.0s)]
*  this time, the audience kind of like flips and they start going, wait a minute, you know, [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6063.4s)]
*  this guy, Triple H is really putting the time he's dedicated to the cratch. So we really miss him. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6068.68s)]
*  We really love him. And you're not doing anything. You're not making, doing any spots or anything [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6073.48s)]
*  like that, but there's this real like lust to have you back. Is this accurate? Yeah. So I go away. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6077.8s)]
*  When I leave, I'm one of the most hated guys in the business. We had just done a thing where [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6083.8s)]
*  Stone Cold wanted to refresh on his character. So he turns heel and we're together and we do this [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6089.24s)]
*  thing. We call it two man power trip and it's us just beating the shit out of everybody. And like [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6094.68s)]
*  we, we have, he's like world champ. I've got the intercontinental title. At one point we're tag [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6099.64s)]
*  champs, right? And we're actually the match where I get injured, we dropped the tag titles to [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6104.2s)]
*  another team that night. That's when I get injured. So, but we're on this killer run and we're both [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6110.52s)]
*  the worst heels there, but I was already that sort of top heel. And I leave nine months later, [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6117.96s)]
*  when I come back. I want to talk about this match specifically, because my understanding is that the [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6125.719999999999s)]
*  chat in the wrestling world is we really miss him and maybe we're not giving him a fair shake. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6131.639999999999s)]
*  We really love this guy. And now there's like a real excitement about you coming back. And then [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6136.84s)]
*  MSG is when you come back and it's not even a match. You're announced that you're just going [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6141.639999999999s)]
*  to come back and cut a promo. What I've been told is by wrestling enthusiasts is that when you come [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6146.44s)]
*  out, it's the biggest pop they've ever heard of Madison Square Garden. For me, it was the biggest [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6153.24s)]
*  pop I'd ever heard, but it was also me. So like, you know, this is what I'm just saying from [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6158.2s)]
*  wrestling enthusiasts. What they said is when you come out and again, you're leaving the company as [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6162.2s)]
*  the biggest heel nine months later, you haven't done anything. It's not like you're cutting [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6166.759999999999s)]
*  promos. There's nothing going on. So it's pure, just, you know what? I kind of miss that guy. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6170.759999999999s)]
*  He was really great for the business. Do you have it? I think it's, I think we watch this. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6175.4s)]
*  I think it's Darth Vader leaving the franchise for a couple of films. And then you realize it [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6179.719999999999s)]
*  was really nice having that bad guy around. And then he comes back and you're like, oh my God. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6184.28s)]
*  Right? Like, yeah. Can we watch this? So what's going through your head? You haven't said any. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6188.28s)]
*  So, so pause it just for a second. So understand as a performer, [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6193.16s)]
*  doesn't matter how big you are. You go away for nine months. When you come back, [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6198.12s)]
*  you don't know if they'll even remember you. There's like, yeah, you're like, well, they care. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6204.12s)]
*  You're scared to death. And it's funny. I'm backstage at Madison square garden and Austin [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6207.32s)]
*  comes up to me. Now Austin had been out for a long period of time with his broken neck and all that [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6213.24s)]
*  stuff. And Austin comes to me and he goes, what's going on kid? And I said, uh, just getting ready [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6217.16s)]
*  for this. And he goes, you freaking yourself out. You think they're not going to remember. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6223.0s)]
*  So he already knows they're not going to care. And I said, yeah, I said, man, [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6227.64s)]
*  how fucking, I don't want crickets, you know, like, fuck, I don't know. And he goes, dude, [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6232.200000000001s)]
*  you're going to blow the roof off this place. He said, have you heard them? Every time they [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6237.88s)]
*  mentioned your name, they're going ape shit. They've been chanting fucking triple H all night long. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6241.64s)]
*  Oh, I didn't know that. So throughout there's this excitement. There's a thirst. He's like, [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6245.72s)]
*  you're fine. They're there. This is going to be off the charts, but still I'm like, I hope so. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6249.88s)]
*  I really hope so. And I'm standing at gorilla position right outside the curtain. Like I'm next [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6255.400000000001s)]
*  like, so they play a thing. They, the studio, this kid, Adam Panucci, who's an incredible editor, [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6261.48s)]
*  did a package for me about my return and it was set to YouTube's beautiful day. And [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6268.5199999999995s)]
*  he, he puts the, so he builds this video. It's incredible. They put that out. It runs for the [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6276.28s)]
*  weeks leading up to, and then I'm going to return at Madison's court garden, which when Vince told me, [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6282.12s)]
*  Hey, we heard you're going to get your clearance and all that stuff. He said, I said, yeah. And [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6286.92s)]
*  he said, what do you think about returning to the garden? And I was like, holy shit. Like to us, [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6291.96s)]
*  that was the biggest of the big Madison square garden was like our WrestleMania. Also the place [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6297.4s)]
*  where you had the controversial moments. Yeah. So many moments at the garden. And so I'm like, [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6303.4s)]
*  Jesus Christ, that's like a storybook thing, right? So they do these videos, but we get to that [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6308.92s)]
*  moment and I'm standing at that curtain while they go to, so they play a thing. They play that [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6316.04s)]
*  video and it says up next, the game, right? The crowd just roars. They're chanting all during the [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6321.08s)]
*  commercial. And I am standing like a idiot at that curtain thinking like, please don't be silent. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6327.48s)]
*  Please don't be silent. Like, you know, I'm petrified. Like I'm going to walk out there [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6334.12s)]
*  and they are not going to give a shit, you know, and then, you know, and then, and then the music [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6337.64s)]
*  hits and you know, you just, you're just so inside your own head that it's, it's crazy. And, you know, [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6344.36s)]
*  at this point, I'm just so, I am out of my mind. Like almost uncontrollable. So [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6358.2s)]
*  that's awesome. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6366.92s)]
*  Now for me, this like even just riling up the crowd like this is, this is foreign to me, but I'm [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6369.8s)]
*  like, I'm used to being, I did it when we were in DX. Obviously I'm used to doing it, but to me, [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6375.72s)]
*  this is, I've been a bad guy. I've been the bad guy now for so long. Like this is, [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6379.88s)]
*  and how does your quad feel? Just all emotion to me. Is your quad healed up? [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6385.8s)]
*  It's healed. You know, it's a funny thing that you, you can [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6389.32s)]
*  be a hundred percent, you can practice, you can get on the field, you can do all the stuff until [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6397.799999999999s)]
*  you go out there live. You just don't know. So the first few matches, it was a bit, [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6402.5199999999995s)]
*  but you're not even doing it, that you're cutting a promo. This is a promo and Kurt [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6407.5599999999995s)]
*  Angle is going to come out. I do a little something. I'm basically just cutting a promo saying I'm back [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6410.759999999999s)]
*  and I'm entering myself in the Royal rumble. And so- [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6414.76s)]
*  Are you supposed to be healed at this point? [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6418.280000000001s)]
*  I think we all knew that there's no way I come back and I'm a bad guy. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6421.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6426.2s)]
*  Right. And the thing for me is I've never been a good guy without a crew around me. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6426.76s)]
*  So now I have to do it and I'm like, I'm not comfortable as a good guy. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6436.04s)]
*  It's foreign to me. It's almost like I have to go into the ring and think, [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6440.68s)]
*  what would I want myself to do if I was the bad guy? [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6445.8s)]
*  Huh? What would, wait, wait, wait. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6449.0s)]
*  If I was the bad guy and I was working with me, what would I want me to do? [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6452.12s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes, yes. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6457.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? I have to like retro. It's another step in my process because the business [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6457.96s)]
*  at this point is not me thinking, it's a feel thing. And you're just kind of doing what's right. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6463.08s)]
*  And I almost have to think about it in a way of like, what would I want my reaction? [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6468.6s)]
*  Because it's not instinctually. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6471.8s)]
*  Yeah. What would I want my reaction to be? [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6473.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6475.0s)]
*  And so I'm not comfortable and I'm just not comfortable as a good guy. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6475.56s)]
*  Are you recutting the promo in your brain based on how much support you have? [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6482.6s)]
*  This, I honestly, I know I'm going to walk out there and I'm going to say, I'm back, [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6488.28s)]
*  I'm entering myself in the Royal Rumble and then Kurt's going to come out. I have zero, [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6494.84s)]
*  like I remember thinking about it. Like, I just almost can't even lay this out word for word [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6500.4400000000005s)]
*  because I'm, I feel like I'm going to be so emotional when I get out there, [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6506.6s)]
*  whether excited or whatever that is. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6511.56s)]
*  Holding back tears a little bit. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6513.24s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's just going to be so overwhelmingly emotional, [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6514.6s)]
*  given everything that I went through to come back that I don't know I'm going to be able [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6519.400000000001s)]
*  to remember it anyways. So I just know I'm back. I'm entering the rumble, you know, [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6523.64s)]
*  and then the Kurt shit. And so I just kind of say what I'm saying. I don't even really. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6529.240000000001s)]
*  Can we go to it? [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6535.08s)]
*  Good thing you had the water bottle. If the tears came, you could have just splashed it. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6536.6s)]
*  And it's a funny thing is that you don't want to show that emotion, [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6541.160000000001s)]
*  but the truth is the crowd just wants the emotion. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6543.56s)]
*  They want the real shit. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6545.72s)]
*  Oh, here it is. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6546.6s)]
*  You can see it. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6547.160000000001s)]
*  So they're going crazy. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6549.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6550.92s)]
*  That's fine. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6551.400000000001s)]
*  You can't even talk. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6551.96s)]
*  You bring the mic to your mouth and they go even crazier. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6553.56s)]
*  But I also know I got to get off the air because I think I'm the last thing in the show. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6557.0s)]
*  So I can't go too long. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6560.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6561.96s)]
*  Just in case you've forgotten, let me tell you just who the hell I am. I am the game. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6562.6s)]

*  Oh, just great. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6583.0s)]

*  A lot of people go, okay, I want to start a business. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6604.68s)]
*  And then years later, you find out that you could have saved so much money [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6606.68s)]
*  if you actually structured everything right. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6609.96s)]
*  Why not just do it from the beginning? [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6611.88s)]

*  business assets. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6623.24s)]

*  and they missed out on that discount code. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6636.36s)]

*  I've been waiting for Verdansk. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6668.76s)]

*  It's rated M for Mature. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6731.08s)]
*  Let's get back to the show. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6732.84s)]
*  Do you think nice guys play better heals? [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6733.8s)]
*  So it's a funny thing and this might be completely off. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6737.88s)]
*  I have like a theory that and I don't mean this in a negative way at all. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6742.04s)]
*  To be the babyface you have to have, you have to be a little bit more selfish. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6750.28s)]
*  You have to be. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6758.84s)]
*  And so Austin was a great babyface but he's not selfish. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6760.44s)]
*  It's sort of he was such a because his character was a bad guy that they just loved. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6767.48s)]
*  But that's societal utility. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6774.2s)]
*  Going against the man. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6776.12s)]
*  You get to be a bad guy because there's a worse guy that you're going to confront. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6777.639999999999s)]
*  So it's a little bit different but you always hear the stories about the top [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6783.32s)]
*  good guy in the business and there's just because it's all about you. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6789.32s)]
*  As a bad guy your job is to make the other guy look good. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6796.12s)]
*  Keep yourself alive doing it. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6799.88s)]
*  Keep yourself hot doing it. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6801.32s)]
*  Keep yourself all that stuff. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6802.68s)]
*  But the truth is the biggest reaction that you get as a bad guy [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6804.12s)]
*  is when you give the good guy the comeback. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6808.599999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6813.5599999999995s)]
*  It looks like you're going to win. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6814.84s)]
*  I know when I do all this horrible shit to this person. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6816.44s)]
*  The biggest reaction we're going to get if I'm working with Rock and he's the bad guy. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6819.88s)]
*  He's the good guy. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6825.0s)]
*  I'm the bad guy. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6825.72s)]
*  I do all this horrible stuff to him. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6826.6s)]
*  Well I know when he starts to finally make that big comeback on me and kick my ass. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6828.52s)]
*  I'm going to fly all over the place for him. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6832.6s)]
*  That's the magic. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6834.92s)]
*  The bad guy sort of creates that. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6837.240000000001s)]
*  You're only as good as a good guy in the business as you are the bad guys that you have to work with. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6839.08s)]
*  That's right because the bigger the villain the more the audience [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6846.04s)]
*  wants to see that villain go down the more they celebrate the baby face. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6848.76s)]
*  We talk about it all the time in the Rocky movies. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6853.08s)]
*  Right? [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6855.48s)]
*  So in the first Rocky he just you know and Rocky's not about boxing but it's about overcoming. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6855.96s)]
*  But the bad guy in Rock is Paul Creed. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6862.28s)]
*  He's just this arrogant guy. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6863.88s)]
*  This guy wants to prove himself against him. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6865.48s)]
*  He doesn't have to win but he just has to stay the distance and he does. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6867.16s)]
*  They get to the second one. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6870.68s)]
*  Okay but now he has all these things he has overcome in his life and it's still the same bad guy. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6872.28s)]
*  But he's got to overcome that and the first one was a fluke and blah blah blah. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6876.5199999999995s)]
*  He overcomes that. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6880.5199999999995s)]
*  Now you get to the third one. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6881.72s)]
*  Now he's succeeded as the baby face. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6882.76s)]
*  So what do they do? [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6884.84s)]
*  They have to make Mr. T the ultimate bad guy that is so mean and so nasty. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6885.56s)]
*  Talk shit about his wife and ends up sort of causing Burgess Meredith so much stress making [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6889.72s)]
*  that he dies and now Rocky's got to avenge. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6895.0s)]
*  He just can't fight. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6897.320000000001s)]
*  He gets the shit kicked out of him. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6898.12s)]
*  Now he's got to find a way to come back against all that and win. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6899.16s)]
*  They get to the next one. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6902.92s)]
*  Now he's the champ again or whatever it is. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6904.04s)]
*  They create a Russian guy because it's the Cold War and all that shit. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6906.2s)]
*  But they create the Russian guy that's so bad. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6910.12s)]
*  They make Rocky befriend Apollo Creed who then gets killed by the big Russian guy and [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6912.52s)]
*  he's got to go to Russia to like you. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6918.360000000001s)]
*  To avenge the loss. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6920.4400000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6921.4800000000005s)]
*  It's sort of how can we make the bad guy to give him something to fight against? [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6921.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6928.120000000001s)]
*  If I don't hate that bad guy, if I'm not rooting against that bad guy, [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6928.4400000000005s)]
*  if that bad guy doesn't stand for everything that I despise, [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6931.320000000001s)]
*  then how can I really root for the baby face? [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6934.040000000001s)]
*  So the core for the story is having a great villain. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6936.280000000001s)]
*  We've talked about this a lot even in like Marvel movies. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6940.04s)]
*  They do villains better than DC. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6943.959999999999s)]
*  Thanos is an amazing villain. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6945.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6947.4s)]
*  It's like you want to hate him but then also like does he have a point? [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6947.639999999999s)]
*  Is there something he's going after? [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6950.44s)]
*  It's what some of the things that we try to do now, a lot of it in our creative is like, [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6951.879999999999s)]
*  I've always believed bad guys have to be justified. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6956.679999999999s)]
*  Might be fucked up reasoning. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6960.919999999999s)]
*  But they have to have. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6962.679999999999s)]
*  Their way of looking at it is really warped. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6963.719999999999s)]
*  They've got to be justified. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6967.08s)]
*  They can't just do like, why are you doing that? [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6968.2s)]
*  Like, because I'm a bad guy. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6970.5199999999995s)]
*  You didn't have to do the mustache thing. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6973.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6974.599999999999s)]
*  But I get what you're saying. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6977.08s)]
*  A lot of times in DC, it's just like I'm space alien that wants to destroy the earth. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6978.04s)]
*  And it's like, who cares? [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6981.4s)]
*  Why is that important? [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6982.599999999999s)]
*  But Thanos going like, hey, it's unfair for people. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6983.5599999999995s)]
*  It's unfair for most people in the galaxy. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6986.04s)]
*  So why don't we just get rid of half of them and then nobody will starve? [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6987.48s)]
*  And you're like, wait a minute, he's kind of got a point. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6989.96s)]
*  There's some empathy in that. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6992.76s)]
*  Plus they were already trying to put that story out there to normalize it for the government. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6993.88s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=6997.8s)]
*  This is actually a transition. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7000.4400000000005s)]
*  Real quick on this story, because specifically with Cena, you have this monumental task taking [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7003.08s)]
*  this super baby face and you have to find a way to turn him into a bad guy that justifies story. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7008.68s)]
*  Because I was looking at it. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7018.2s)]
*  I'm looking at some of the stats and it's like, OK, he has 16 championships. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7018.92s)]
*  He's tied with Ric Flair. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7022.68s)]
*  And it's like, you're going into WrestleMania. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7024.04s)]
*  And then without any storylines, it's like, OK, of course, [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7025.56s)]
*  he's going to win and then he gets his 17th and then it's over. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7027.4s)]
*  And then I'm watching this patch and I see that great moment with the rock [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7030.92s)]
*  and the face go cold and that this idea that like I'm going to end wrestling. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7034.36s)]
*  I'm going to win and then retire and then nobody will ever win a belt for real again. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7039.16s)]
*  And now all of a sudden I'm like, if I'm a wrestling fan, I've got to protect wrestling. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7043.48s)]
*  I've got to find a way to bring it. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7048.36s)]
*  And now. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7049.5599999999995s)]
*  And John's reasoning for that is like, for 20 years, I've had to listen to you people [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7050.36s)]
*  tell me Cena sucks. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7055.72s)]
*  Let's go Cena. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7057.0s)]
*  Cena sucks. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7057.8s)]
*  I've had to, you know, you shit on my ideas, you shit on these things, [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7058.52s)]
*  all this stuff like that. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7061.8s)]
*  Every turn I've tried to make and all I've ever done is give you everything I have. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7062.92s)]
*  And it wasn't enough. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7067.96s)]
*  You always want more. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7069.240000000001s)]
*  It's like, so there's this place of justification where you can go like, [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7070.4400000000005s)]
*  well, I kind of get that. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7075.56s)]
*  Yeah, he's done with it. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7076.92s)]
*  It's like, why haven't you given him up? [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7078.12s)]
*  He's done everything for the business. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7079.320000000001s)]
*  He's always done the right thing. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7080.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7082.04s)]
*  He should be the most beloved guy ever in anything. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7082.28s)]
*  And now in his mind, he's protecting the business from somebody like Cody, [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7086.5199999999995s)]
*  who in his mind is just copying him and phony going into this thing and they love him for it. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7093.32s)]
*  And he's angry about it. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7100.44s)]
*  Why the fuck does he get all the love? [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7101.88s)]
*  They love him for this. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7103.4s)]
*  And wait, you guys, I gave you everything. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7104.36s)]
*  Why didn't I get the love? [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7105.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7106.5199999999995s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7106.599999999999s)]
*  So you get the resentment. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7107.16s)]
*  She's justified in all of it. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7108.12s)]
*  And it's kind of what works with the story, no matter how. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7110.5199999999995s)]
*  And look, I'll say this from a bold standpoint. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7114.919999999999s)]
*  It would have been so easy for John, who's making movies and is one of the busiest people I know, [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7120.599999999999s)]
*  to say, look, I'm coming back for a year. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7127.48s)]
*  Let's just give me the fucking belt. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7130.04s)]
*  I'm going to go out there and do my greatest hits. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7131.4s)]
*  And people will love it. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7133.799999999999s)]
*  And I'll sell some merch and then it'll be done. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7135.16s)]
*  And I'll say, thank you very much. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7137.24s)]
*  And I'll ride off into the sunset. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7138.36s)]
*  He could have very easily done that. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7140.04s)]
*  But when we threw the heel idea at him, he was like, fuck yeah. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7142.36s)]
*  He jumped at it. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7147.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7147.8s)]
*  Like, man, this is challenging to me. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7148.12s)]
*  I love the challenge. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7152.28s)]
*  When we pitched it, I got off the phone with John. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7153.88s)]
*  And he seemed very excited. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7157.88s)]
*  But within the next five minutes, I got like six texts from him. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7159.4s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7164.44s)]
*  Where I was like, oh my god, he's in. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7165.0s)]
*  Oh, he started pitching ideas. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7166.36s)]
*  He couldn't stop thinking about it. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7169.32s)]
*  And he had to talk to somebody about it [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7170.92s)]
*  because he was on a movie set. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7172.839999999999s)]
*  So he just kept texting me about it. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7173.96s)]
*  And I was like, oh, and this has piqued his interest. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7176.28s)]
*  And it's cool to see John, who's been gone and in and out [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7179.799999999999s)]
*  for a long time. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7185.16s)]
*  And you're doing that. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7185.88s)]
*  You're not that same level to see him so engaged and so passionate [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7187.16s)]
*  about this now and what he's doing and the whole thing. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7193.639999999999s)]
*  It's so cool to watch. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7196.28s)]
*  So cool. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7197.88s)]
*  Now, I mean, what were you going to say? [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7198.52s)]
*  I want to come back to story, but there's a question that occurred to me [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7200.4400000000005s)]
*  that I have to ask. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7202.76s)]
*  We always hear everything is wrestling. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7204.36s)]
*  So you probably as a wrestler look at everything differently. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7205.96s)]
*  And you don't have to put opinions out there. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7208.36s)]
*  But in 2015, when you're seeing Trump come out there and generate heat, [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7210.12s)]
*  which would be the wrestling term, are you looking at that? [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7213.96s)]
*  And you're like, oh, this guy's going to win. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7216.28s)]
*  Like, I can feel the heat. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7218.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm a big believer. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7220.2s)]
*  It's funny that Nick Khan, who's the president of the company. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7221.08s)]
*  Shout out, Nick. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7223.64s)]
*  I like Nick, man. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7224.28s)]
*  He's the best. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7225.56s)]
*  He's absolutely the best. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7226.2s)]
*  I couldn't do this without him, but he's the best. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7228.6s)]
*  But he always has this thing where the most charismatic guy wins. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7232.200000000001s)]
*  Doesn't matter. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7236.4400000000005s)]
*  Doesn't matter your policy. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7237.320000000001s)]
*  Doesn't matter anything. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7238.360000000001s)]
*  Whoever the most charismatic guy is in the debates wins. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7239.400000000001s)]
*  And you can historically look at that. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7242.6s)]
*  And it's pretty accurate. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7244.280000000001s)]
*  And I think Trump's ability as an orator, as like him or hate him the way he does it. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7246.200000000001s)]
*  But he's charismatic in so many ways. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7254.280000000001s)]
*  And I think he likes getting under people's skin. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7261.080000000001s)]
*  I think he likes generating. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7263.96s)]
*  I mean, he plays a great heal. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7265.320000000001s)]
*  The way he does. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7266.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's amazing. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7267.400000000001s)]
*  And it's genius. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7270.6s)]
*  And it worked in our business. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7271.400000000001s)]
*  Do I think he got that from our business? [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7272.6s)]
*  I think he innately understands that. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7275.72s)]
*  It's been his whole life. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7277.4800000000005s)]
*  You think about that. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7279.400000000001s)]
*  Like, why? [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7280.280000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of billionaires in the world, I suppose. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7281.56s)]
*  Why was he the most famous one? [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7284.200000000001s)]
*  Why was he the one that was in People magazine every weekend with everybody? [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7285.64s)]
*  Why was he seen as the epitome of that billionaire status and all that stuff? [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7291.64s)]
*  Because of his charisma and his character and who he is and the way he can speak about it [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7301.240000000001s)]
*  and do all those things. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7305.8s)]
*  He just captivates people. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7306.76s)]
*  And I think it's why he is where he is. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7308.04s)]
*  Also, understanding heat. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7310.6s)]
*  And I thought the Vintsog did a good job of explaining this. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7311.88s)]
*  Heat isn't necessarily everybody loves you. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7315.0s)]
*  You can have heat with everyone hates you. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7318.120000000001s)]
*  It's just energy towards you. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7320.280000000001s)]
*  Realistically, yeah, that is the heat is that everybody hating you. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7322.200000000001s)]
*  But like in our business, in our parlance. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7327.160000000001s)]
*  You can't have heat as a baby face? [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7331.72s)]
*  I mean, you can. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7333.72s)]
*  But that's not normally how we would just say the baby face is, man, he's over. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7334.280000000001s)]
*  Oh, so heat is only a negative thing. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7339.400000000001s)]
*  Sort of in our business anyways. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7341.8s)]
*  Negative meaning it's a positive thing. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7343.96s)]
*  It's about someone acting negatively. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7345.400000000001s)]
*  Man, he's got a ton of heat. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7347.56s)]
*  That's me saying, man, that heel is over. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7348.68s)]
*  As a baby face, I would say that baby face is like he's over. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7351.88s)]
*  Cody Rhodes is over. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7357.72s)]
*  Drew McIntyre's got a lot of heat. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7359.160000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7361.4800000000005s)]
*  Got it. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7362.360000000001s)]
*  Got it. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7363.0s)]
*  Both very over. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7363.88s)]
*  So it's a different. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7365.64s)]
*  As someone who's been top heel, do you have a little bit more, [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7369.24s)]
*  I don't want to say respect, but like love for the people who bring heat, [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7373.8s)]
*  the people who are the heels? [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7379.0s)]
*  Yeah, especially if they do it well. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7381.08s)]
*  Right. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7383.16s)]
*  The hardest job right now to me in the business is making a baby face that everybody loves. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7383.88s)]
*  Because everybody's got something they like differently. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7389.5599999999995s)]
*  And so if you're too good of a good guy, they just like, [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7394.92s)]
*  bambi pambi, like goody two shoes. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7400.92s)]
*  They hate you for that. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7403.96s)]
*  It's hard. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7405.56s)]
*  So it's hard to keep the majority of people liking a good guy for a long period of time. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7406.68s)]
*  That's why like a CM Punk is so popular because he's kind of not a baby face. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7411.88s)]
*  He has a rebellious nature. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7417.88s)]
*  It's like anti-authority. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7419.0s)]
*  He's an anti-authority, anti-this, anti-that. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7420.6s)]
*  Also phenomenal wrestler. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7423.48s)]
*  I remember MSG, like him and Seth, and Seth too. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7424.919999999999s)]
*  Even if you didn't know anything about their characters and you were just dropped into MSG [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7429.0s)]
*  that night, you just watched these guys go at it. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7432.5199999999995s)]
*  Incredibly engaging. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7435.08s)]
*  And Punk, same with Seth, same with Roman, same with Cody. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7436.36s)]
*  Yeah, Roman too. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7440.44s)]
*  They can verbally get all that reaction that you need. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7442.04s)]
*  They almost don't have to ever wrestle on TV or do much stuff on TV because [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7447.639999999999s)]
*  their character is such and they can talk. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7453.08s)]
*  Punk can talk into just about anything on the stick. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7455.72s)]
*  He's great. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7458.12s)]
*  Did baby faces last longer in different eras? [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7459.32s)]
*  Yeah, because the business was set up differently. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7462.5199999999995s)]
*  So like in the generation prior to this, so like Vince's dad, Vince Senior, [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7464.599999999999s)]
*  when he had the company, he would have Bruno as champion or back Linda as champion, [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7471.24s)]
*  and then he would bring in heels. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7476.68s)]
*  It was a heel factory. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7479.5599999999995s)]
*  Right? [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7481.32s)]
*  Like a heel would come in. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7481.56s)]
*  George the animal steel or Stan Hansen or whoever the heel was would come in. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7486.52s)]
*  They'd beat up the number two good guy to get heat on them. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7492.12s)]
*  Then they'd get their way up to like back Lin or Bruno. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7497.0s)]
*  Then they'd do two or three around the horn with him, Madison Square Garden, [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7500.52s)]
*  do all this stuff, all the big clubs, do all that stuff, get all that out of it. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7505.08s)]
*  Then once they blew that off and he was done with Bruno, [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7509.64s)]
*  he'd go back down to the number two guy who would now get his revenge, [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7512.280000000001s)]
*  overcome that guy would leave, he'd go to another territory. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7516.12s)]
*  Another bad guy would come in and then cycle it out and repeat to some degree. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7519.4800000000005s)]
*  Right? [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7524.12s)]
*  So does that say something about culture today that there's less of an affinity for [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7524.4400000000005s)]
*  like long term baby faces? [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7528.12s)]
*  Like how does WWE today reflect culture now? [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7529.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's difficult. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7532.68s)]
*  I think like, I think everybody in the world wants to see you succeed, [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7534.12s)]
*  just not too long till they flip on it. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7537.160000000001s)]
*  They want to see you come up. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7540.360000000001s)]
*  They want to see you come up. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7541.72s)]
*  Everybody wants to see you come up, but staying there. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7542.76s)]
*  It's tough. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7545.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. It's something we said here before. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7546.200000000001s)]
*  It's like when you're on your way up, you represent people's dreams for themselves. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7547.96s)]
*  And then when you're on top, you represent what they may never achieve. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7552.84s)]
*  They may never achieve and what they'd like to achieve, but you're in the way. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7556.6s)]
*  You're in the way. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7559.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7559.72s)]
*  So it's like, okay, you got to get down. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7560.12s)]
*  We always want to move this saying in our business. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7561.96s)]
*  People want to see you do well. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7563.72s)]
*  They just don't want to see you do too well. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7565.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7566.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7567.88s)]
*  Okay. So now you know that and you understand that's people's reaction to it. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7568.4400000000005s)]
*  So you have like this white meat baby face in Cody, right? [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7573.24s)]
*  And he seemed to have maintained it, but is there a point where you're going to have to go, uh-oh? [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7578.12s)]
*  It's on us to try to keep it, right? [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7584.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7586.92s)]
*  But yeah, at some point you'll probably get to a place where they're just, [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7587.32s)]
*  you know, look, John was white meat baby face for a long period of time. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7591.88s)]
*  I just saw him do an interview the other day where he said like, [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7597.32s)]
*  I don't remember what WrestleMania was like 22 or something like that. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7599.72s)]
*  He and I wrestled in, uh, at WrestleMania in Chicago and I was bad guy [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7602.28s)]
*  and John was the ultimate good guy and I was the big bad guy at the time. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7607.56s)]
*  But as we built that, no matter what we were doing, the more I beat up John, [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7612.04s)]
*  the more they liked me, the more John would try to make comebacks, [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7616.2s)]
*  the more they were booing John. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7619.88s)]
*  And even in the match, it was like 50, 50, right? [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7621.64s)]
*  And I remember having a conversation with John about it because it was bugging him. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7624.84s)]
*  It was just starting to happen. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7629.32s)]
*  And I remember saying like, ah, who cares? [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7630.76s)]
*  You know, the Yankees and the Red Sox all in one package. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7632.6s)]
*  It's so loud, right? [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7636.04s)]
*  Who cares? [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7636.92s)]
*  Just go with it. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7637.4800000000005s)]
*  And he was having trouble with this idea that he's supposed to be baby faced, [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7639.0s)]
*  but not everybody was buying in. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7642.2s)]
*  Just there's a point in time in that where, yeah, you just like started, [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7643.8s)]
*  well, man, that's not the reaction I'm trying to get. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7646.76s)]
*  I'm not trying to make them say Cena sucks or anything else, but yet there they go with it. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7649.72s)]
*  And I'm doing all the right things. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7654.36s)]
*  They're just for whatever reason, starting to choke on it. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7657.08s)]
*  Well, maybe that's culture, right? [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7660.759999999999s)]
*  It is. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7662.2s)]
*  I truly believe that. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7662.759999999999s)]
*  Look, name somebody in pop culture that has been popular forever. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7664.12s)]
*  No one says a bad word about him. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7670.5199999999995s)]
*  And it's just only one Leonardo DiCaprio. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7671.96s)]
*  The worst thing they say about him is he has sex with hot girls. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7675.0s)]
*  That's the thing. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7679.96s)]
*  It's like, what a horrible guy. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7680.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7682.04s)]
*  And even just in saying that, you've just made half of the population love him even more. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7682.84s)]
*  Keanu Reeves is maybe the only person I can think. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7687.72s)]
*  Yeah, Keanu Reeves. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7689.56s)]
*  And because of who he is outside and all that stuff. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7691.08s)]
*  I have a theory on these guys. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7694.92s)]
*  It's tough. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7695.96s)]
*  I have a theory on these guys. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7696.52s)]
*  It's lack of exposure. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7697.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7698.68s)]
*  So if you're doing it week in and week out, it's tough for people to stomach that. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7700.2s)]
*  If they don't actually love you for you for whatever reason, [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7705.64s)]
*  you start to be this representative of infallible greatness, [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7708.68s)]
*  which makes a lot of people be like, well, I'm infallible. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7712.28s)]
*  What the fuck is up with that? [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7714.44s)]
*  But if you put out one movie a year, or Denzel is another one, [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7716.44s)]
*  it's like nobody's ever hated Denzel. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7719.5599999999995s)]
*  We'll never hate Denzel. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7721.08s)]
*  But if you're putting out one or two movies here tops, and then you go away. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7722.2s)]
*  I think a lot of times with the even actors, [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7725.8s)]
*  and this is to the point about everything's wrestling, [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7727.96s)]
*  it's like the actors that are constantly in your face, [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7730.28s)]
*  Keanu looks like he's trying to get away. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7733.8s)]
*  Any picture of Keanu, he's on the subway with his hat on. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7736.44s)]
*  He's fighting. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7739.24s)]
*  The actors that need the attention every second, [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7740.76s)]
*  people start to sour on them a bit. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7743.16s)]
*  When you see them constantly at TMZ, you see them constantly in the paparazzi. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7744.84s)]
*  You see them all this stuff and it becomes too much. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7748.6s)]
*  You become desensitized to it. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7751.400000000001s)]
*  Then you start to be like, ah, it's full of shit. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7752.92s)]
*  Fuck that guy's full of shit. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7754.360000000001s)]
*  And you're going to fuck up. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7756.04s)]
*  And you start to turn on it. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7757.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7758.280000000001s)]
*  And I do think that longevity is part of scarcity as well. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7758.68s)]
*  But in your business, you can't go, hey, Cody, we're going to need you to go away. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7764.2s)]
*  He's got to be there every night. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7767.24s)]
*  He's the fucking champ. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7768.52s)]
*  So you need to build up heels that people despise. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7769.72s)]
*  And that want to come at him in a way that sort of they feel like, oh, maybe he's getting [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7773.96s)]
*  screwed over there. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7783.0s)]
*  What do you know what I mean? [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7783.8s)]
*  You have to- [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7784.68s)]
*  It feels unfair. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7784.92s)]
*  There's like something like just happening. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7785.72s)]
*  It's actually unfair. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7787.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7788.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7788.4400000000005s)]
*  You have to try to create that. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7788.84s)]
*  It's the most, I say it all the time, it's the most difficult thing in our business to do [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7791.0s)]
*  is create somebody that is universally loved and keep them there. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7795.4800000000005s)]
*  How do you have that talk with talent where it's like, if you think it's in their best [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7799.16s)]
*  interest for you to go away and have the audience miss you for a while, like how do you have [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7803.24s)]
*  that talk with them? [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7807.5599999999995s)]
*  You just have to tell them. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7808.28s)]
*  Like, I think, hey, let's cool this down for a little bit. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7809.4s)]
*  Let's step you out of it. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7813.32s)]
*  And there's always, a lot of times we don't even, it's not our call because somebody will [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7814.44s)]
*  get injured or something will happen. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7820.76s)]
*  And you're just like, this was a kind of a, you never want to say that to them. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7822.28s)]
*  Like, well, you got injured was a good thing. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7826.2s)]
*  But like sometimes taking that time away is a good thing. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7828.2s)]
*  There's, you're obviously familiar with Floyd Mayweather, right? [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7831.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7834.2s)]
*  And I'm a big boxing fan. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7834.839999999999s)]
*  I was watching his career. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7836.36s)]
*  I helped him when he wrestled for us and fought Big Show. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7837.4s)]
*  I tried to help train him for that. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7840.12s)]
*  How was he in training? [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7841.719999999999s)]
*  He was awesome. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7843.0s)]
*  And he was like, you know, good listener and he was down to do whatever it went through. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7843.639999999999s)]
*  I say this all the time. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7846.679999999999s)]
*  He would show up with like this massive entourage, everybody hooting and hollering [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7847.639999999999s)]
*  and just crazy and all that stuff. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7851.639999999999s)]
*  And we'd talk for a little bit and then he'd be like, all right, you want to get down to work? [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7853.32s)]
*  And I'd be like, yeah. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7858.12s)]
*  And he'd whistle or something and he'd be like, all right, business, everybody out. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7858.76s)]
*  And everybody would stop talking. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7862.36s)]
*  Anybody that stayed would stop talking. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7863.96s)]
*  Everybody else would get out of the room. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7865.48s)]
*  It was like a laser focus. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7866.599999999999s)]
*  And like the first time we trained together, we did like two hours or whatever. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7869.08s)]
*  And then I had to go on the road and then I came back, I think to like Vegas or something. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7873.639999999999s)]
*  And we get same thing. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7878.84s)]
*  Everybody's there. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7881.32s)]
*  He tells everybody to get out and I go, all right, I just want to review what we talked about last [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7881.96s)]
*  time. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7885.8s)]
*  He goes, can I say it to you? [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7885.96s)]
*  And he like went on for like 20 minutes and told me like everything. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7887.4800000000005s)]
*  And I was like, damn. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7891.32s)]
*  I mean, that's like an unbelievable amount of discipline. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7893.88s)]
*  Like the thing about Floyd is there's the antics and there's the character or whatever. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7896.04s)]
*  But like when you watch him in the ring, it is a huge WWE fan growing up. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7899.0s)]
*  So like that's where the whole money may whether he makes so much sense. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7902.92s)]
*  He had that conversation with me about like, look, I knew pretty boy Floyd was only going to get so [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7905.96s)]
*  far. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7911.08s)]
*  You can make the argument that I was the greatest boxer, but the real argument is what's the [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7911.5599999999995s)]
*  greatest box office? [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7916.92s)]
*  How do you make that? [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7917.8s)]
*  I need to create a character and I need an avenue in which to sell that character. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7918.5199999999995s)]
*  He created the character and then he went and sold 24 seven days. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7923.16s)]
*  And then that was the avenue in which to sell the character. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7928.12s)]
*  And think about it. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7931.4s)]
*  When he goes up in weight and starts fighting these bigger guys and he's having some hand [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7933.5599999999995s)]
*  problems, he's not really getting these knockouts. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7936.76s)]
*  He's fighting a much more defensive style. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7938.76s)]
*  So how do you sell out pay per views? [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7941.16s)]
*  Fighting a style that like casuals might not care. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7943.8s)]
*  I love it because I love boxing. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7946.28s)]
*  I'm looking at the best ever. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7947.48s)]
*  You like the science. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7948.44s)]
*  I like it, but not everybody wants the science. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7949.4s)]
*  Most don't. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7951.24s)]
*  They most don't. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7952.04s)]
*  So what do you do? [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7952.68s)]
*  You make yourself hated. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7953.8s)]
*  You make people root against you and he becomes this ultimate heel and people were paying [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7955.24s)]
*  70 bucks to watch him lose and he'd never fucking lose. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7959.72s)]
*  And the genius of what he did was not only make people hate him, but I will make you believe this [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7963.4s)]
*  other guy might have a chance. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7970.44s)]
*  All these guys. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7973.48s)]
*  This guy's got an unorthodox style and Floyd's starting to get older. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7975.96s)]
*  Like he's showing you flaws in his buildup of 24 seven. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7981.879999999999s)]
*  He's showing you the flaws. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7986.2s)]
*  There's too much family drama going on. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7987.879999999999s)]
*  He's not focused. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7990.04s)]
*  He's not training. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7991.48s)]
*  Right. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7992.5199999999995s)]
*  He's eating like shit. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7992.679999999999s)]
*  All these things. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7994.12s)]
*  Meanwhile, they're showing Ortiz or these other guys. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7994.839999999999s)]
*  Incredible. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7997.08s)]
*  He looks incredible. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7997.5599999999995s)]
*  Remember one man, Wal Marquez was drinking his pee. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=7998.36s)]
*  They're doing all these crazy unorthodox training things. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8001.4s)]
*  I walked him to the ring. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8004.599999999999s)]
*  So for the Marquez fight, it was one of the craziest things ever. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8005.799999999999s)]
*  First of all, I'm backstage with them. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8008.839999999999s)]
*  I show up and they're like, hey, champ wants to see us. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8011.4s)]
*  I go in the back and he's laying on the couch watching basketball game. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8015.48s)]
*  I come in and he's like, what's up? [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8018.5199999999995s)]
*  And we talk for a few minutes and then I'm like, all right, man, I'm going to get out [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8019.88s)]
*  of your hair. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8023.48s)]
*  Let me go back out here. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8023.96s)]
*  And he's like, no, I mean, you ain't in my hair. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8025.16s)]
*  I'm just watching the game. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8027.24s)]
*  I got money on this. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8028.2s)]
*  He's like, I'm just sitting here. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8028.92s)]
*  You won't hang out. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8030.12s)]
*  Sit down, man. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8030.92s)]
*  Hang out. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8031.719999999999s)]
*  So I'm like, okay. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8032.76s)]
*  So I sit down for a few minutes. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8033.8s)]
*  We talk a little bit. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8034.84s)]
*  As soon as he's breaking the conversation, I'm like, all right, man, I'm going to get [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8036.04s)]
*  out of your way and let you do things. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8038.679999999999s)]
*  He's like, I'm telling you, man, I'm just sitting here. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8040.36s)]
*  I said, well, I know it's game day, man. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8043.8s)]
*  I know you got shit to do. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8045.24s)]
*  He's like, if I haven't done all the shit I need to do before today, I've already lost. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8046.28s)]
*  I've done everything there is to do. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8051.8s)]
*  Ain't nothing going to change it now. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8053.32s)]
*  I'm going to put my gloves on a little bit. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8054.92s)]
*  You sit through the whole thing. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8056.44s)]
*  I'm going to start to warm up. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8057.719999999999s)]
*  Then I'm going to go out there and fight. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8058.919999999999s)]
*  Simple as that. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8061.639999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8063.0s)]
*  I sat down and he just went back to watching the game like he was Saturday on his couch. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8063.4s)]
*  And then the other crazy thing was we said that I sit there. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8068.919999999999s)]
*  At one point, he's talking shit to like Bernard Hopkins. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8073.0s)]
*  He's in the corner. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8076.12s)]
*  Marquez is throwing punches at him and he's leaning back talking shit in between Bobbin [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8077.4s)]
*  and Weaver talking shit to fucking Bernard Hopkins. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8081.719999999999s)]
*  Which I'm like crazy. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8084.68s)]
*  They get us up in the last round to walk us into the ring. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8088.4400000000005s)]
*  And so like we're in there like this 10 seconds after it's over. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8091.4800000000005s)]
*  And he's walking back towards us. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8095.8s)]
*  Bell rings, they get me in the ring. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8099.08s)]
*  He's walking back towards us. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8101.16s)]
*  And as he's walking back towards us, I kind of look at him and he's like very lightly covered [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8103.24s)]
*  in sweat, like very lightly. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8107.72s)]
*  He's not like, like he wasn't working that hard. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8108.92s)]
*  And as he's walking, he goes, that's motherfucking beat Pacquiao twice. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8111.4s)]
*  I was like, Jesus, this guy is just too much. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8117.48s)]
*  But he got it. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8120.759999999999s)]
*  He got the storytelling. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8121.48s)]
*  Got the storytelling. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8122.5199999999995s)]
*  That ability. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8124.04s)]
*  How many people did he make you believe this is the guy? [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8126.5199999999995s)]
*  Anybody ever, like I brought up the Ortiz, anybody ever hear that guy prior to that fight? [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8130.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, Rumblings and Boxing, of course, but the average person know. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8135.24s)]
*  Obviously Pacquiao was big and then. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8138.44s)]
*  Calvarez, Cotto. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8141.24s)]
*  I mean, Canelo. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8143.4s)]
*  It's crazy to see what Canelo's done and what I was at that Canelo fight. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8144.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I was there too. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8147.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, it was like Canelo didn't lay a hand on him. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8149.08s)]
*  It was unbelievable. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8151.799999999999s)]
*  That was the thing. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8153.32s)]
*  And he made it seem like, okay, Canelo's going to kill this guy. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8154.12s)]
*  And then he walked in there. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8158.12s)]
*  It made me feel like the part when Canelo throws a big wild punch and he looks over there. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8159.08s)]
*  See, like, who are you trying to punch? [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8162.839999999999s)]
*  You know, like just. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8165.08s)]
*  But that's the shit why people every time they wanted to see him, [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8167.4s)]
*  somebody please shut this guy up and knock him out. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8170.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8173.16s)]
*  And then he would, you know, just go in there and it was almost like it was easy. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8173.48s)]
*  So what is it about us then? [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8179.32s)]
*  I mean, that's where like wrestling is just perfect and understanding human condition. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8180.92s)]
*  And I think now that I think now more than ever, maybe you ushered this in now, [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8184.84s)]
*  is there as there's this like blend between reality and wrestling, [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8189.32s)]
*  people are much more aware of like what's happening with storylines. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8193.16s)]
*  So it's maybe even more difficult for you to catch them off guard. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8195.880000000001s)]
*  But like, what is it about the human condition that we need these bad guys? [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8199.24s)]
*  It's this constant like David versus Goliath. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8203.0s)]
*  We, I don't know, man. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8204.92s)]
*  You know, it's a funny thing. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8205.960000000001s)]
*  Our business, you can make our business so complex. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8206.92s)]
*  The truth is, it's the same stories have been being told since the beginning of time. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8211.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8215.32s)]
*  Bad guy, good guy, good guy, fights bad guy, bad guy does something terrible to the good guy. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8216.2s)]
*  Good guy makes a comeback. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8221.24s)]
*  Hopefully good guy wins. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8222.36s)]
*  If you want to tell a good story, make people keep coming back. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8223.72s)]
*  Sometimes you got to have the bad guy win so that you get to, right? [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8226.04s)]
*  Like I use that as sometimes there's a, we'll be writing a show and we get to the end and, [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8229.0s)]
*  you know, there's people that filter through the show. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8234.92s)]
*  So one of the producers will read the show and he'll be like, [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8238.12s)]
*  I'm just going to say this whole show is heat driven. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8241.48s)]
*  Like every bad guy goes over, every bad guy looks good. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8243.960000000001s)]
*  The whole thing is bad guy, bad guy, bad guy. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8246.92s)]
*  Might not be the best live experience. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8249.8s)]
*  And I'm like Empire Strikes Back, dude, we're good. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8251.72s)]
*  Right? [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8254.759999999998s)]
*  Today's the bad guy's day and we're good with that. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8256.199999999999s)]
*  So you're okay with not giving an audience what they want in the short term [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8260.039999999999s)]
*  because the long term payoff is that much more valuable. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8266.279999999999s)]
*  Look, sometimes you're wrong, but the truth is, you know, you can't, [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8269.4s)]
*  you can't judge the story you're being told by the moment in time you're in [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8274.76s)]
*  and how people are reacting to it because hopefully if you're smart, [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8281.480000000001s)]
*  you know where the story's going. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8285.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8286.28s)]
*  And if you believe in the story and the payoff, you're going to go through times [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8286.68s)]
*  where people are like, this sucks. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8290.2s)]
*  I don't like this. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8292.6s)]
*  And you're okay with that. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8293.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8294.6s)]
*  Because, you know, most people are saying this sucks. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8295.800000000001s)]
*  I don't like it, but I'm going to tune in next week and see if they fix it. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8299.640000000001s)]
*  Whatever. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8304.439999999999s)]
*  Because it's terrible. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8304.84s)]
*  How long can you stretch that out? [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8305.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8307.64s)]
*  You know, and that's the thing. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8307.96s)]
*  And look, I'm not going to say we're always successful at it. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8309.4s)]
*  Nobody's got 100% bat average. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8312.279999999999s)]
*  I like to think we're pretty good at it, but you cannot panic. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8314.199999999999s)]
*  Dude, there's the, do you watch White Lotus at all? [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8318.439999999999s)]
*  You fall in this season? [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8320.68s)]
*  I'm just so busy. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8321.88s)]
*  Okay. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8323.08s)]
*  So there's this great show called White Lotus, right? [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8323.32s)]
*  I've only watched this season and there's two other seasons. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8325.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8327.4s)]
*  But like the first four episodes came out and people were panning it. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8328.119999999999s)]
*  They were going, ah, this is bullshit. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8332.76s)]
*  Or like, oh, this season is, you know, it's, what is it? [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8334.76s)]
*  You jumped the shark or whatever. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8337.08s)]
*  Like, oh, this is boring, whatever. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8338.28s)]
*  And I bumped into one of the producers and he was like, [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8339.960000000001s)]
*  just sit back, relax and enjoy the show. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8343.72s)]
*  And I was like, oh, that's a really confident, that's a really confident take. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8346.12s)]
*  And episode five, six, seven, it's like four episodes just, you planted all the seeds. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8349.32s)]
*  And when they went to harvest it, it shut the internet down. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8355.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8359.32s)]
*  It was like the only conversation. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8359.72s)]
*  So it's having maybe the balls to like put those- [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8361.24s)]
*  Rock says it all the time. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8364.28s)]
*  What did you say? [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8365.4s)]
*  When they'll come in and they'll like, that was stupid. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8365.88s)]
*  Rock did this thing and he was like, just shut up and enjoy the ride. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8368.44s)]
*  Because he knows where it's going. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8371.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8373.24s)]
*  Or we know where we're going to get it to, or we're confident in the fact that we will get this [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8373.56s)]
*  place as it needs to go. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8377.56s)]
*  Sometimes, sometimes you're in the build for something and you know, people don't take that. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8378.52s)]
*  Well, I wish they would have done this. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8385.32s)]
*  Well, yeah, we are going to do that, but I can't do it today. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8386.92s)]
*  The thing's not for six weeks still. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8389.48s)]
*  I got to do it down here where, you know, like you can't give them the payoff in week one. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8391.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8395.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8396.279999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8396.6s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8397.16s)]
*  As comics, we're all familiar with bombing. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8398.279999999999s)]
*  Do you have any storylines or anything you've written in that you were like, [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8400.359999999999s)]
*  oh, this is going to pay off crazy and then doesn't. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8404.84s)]
*  And then you're watching the back like, oh, fuck. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8407.08s)]
*  No, I think because usually if you- and that happens for sure, but like usually- [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8409.56s)]
*  Here's the beautiful thing about our world. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8416.439999999999s)]
*  The internet's not real life, right? [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8419.8s)]
*  And the bitching and the fucking complaining that is on there is not real life. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8422.199999999999s)]
*  Like we can, you could, you could read the internet and it'll sound like this thing is [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8426.6s)]
*  dead. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8431.08s)]
*  It's not, you know, like, and I'll use Cody as the example. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8431.48s)]
*  Cody's already jumped the shark. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8434.68s)]
*  He's dead as a baby face. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8436.119999999999s)]
*  He's like, really? [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8437.4s)]
*  Cause I don't know. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8438.039999999999s)]
*  I'm in an arena with 10,000, 15,000 people every night going ape shit for me, selling [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8439.24s)]
*  the most merchandise. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8443.56s)]
*  He's like, yeah, like, but the sure, whatever you want to say on the internet. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8444.52s)]
*  Right. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8449.16s)]
*  That's the golden rule. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8450.279999999999s)]
*  So the beautiful thing for our business, unlike a movie or a TV show or even a book or anything [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8451.24s)]
*  else, it's like we have a focus group. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8458.199999999999s)]
*  Every single night. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8460.44s)]
*  You go out and you do stand up, right? [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8461.64s)]
*  Like you do your stand up for a year before you do the TV special or whatever, because [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8464.52s)]
*  you're trying out all the shit and you're seeing what works and what doesn't. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8468.92s)]
*  If you're terrible at your job, you just do it the way you want to do it. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8472.44s)]
*  It bombs. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8475.56s)]
*  If you're good at your job, you tweak things, you change things, make it seem fresh still [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8476.28s)]
*  all the time, but you're, you're shifting along the way until you get to where it's [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8481.08s)]
*  just right. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8484.44s)]
*  And then you go put it out there. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8484.92s)]
*  As we begin to tell these stories, you know, this is working. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8487.400000000001s)]
*  This is not working. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8491.400000000001s)]
*  And whether people are bitching online or people, the reaction of people live. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8492.84s)]
*  Right. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8499.320000000002s)]
*  J. Uso's terrible. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8499.480000000001s)]
*  It's never going to, what are they doing? [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8501.480000000001s)]
*  They're eating. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8503.08s)]
*  Dude, they're eating. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8503.720000000001s)]
*  Again, merch reaction in the crowd, everything he does, like, yeah, it's just opinion of [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8505.72s)]
*  a few people. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8513.08s)]
*  So if a story piece bombs, you guys can get back and be like, all right, let's just pivot [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8514.359999999999s)]
*  and then we can say that. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8517.88s)]
*  Hey, that didn't go the way I thought it was going to go. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8518.76s)]
*  Man, they didn't, they didn't, they didn't take that or they didn't react to that or [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8521.64s)]
*  that didn't click the way we thought it was going to. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8525.56s)]
*  What if we do this? [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8529.08s)]
*  And you pivot and you move, right? [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8530.84s)]
*  Um, we, we, that's, that's all the time that's being a good storyteller. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8533.24s)]
*  That's being, you know, and I think in our business, our business slightly has changed [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8538.84s)]
*  now because of TV and the live nature of it and stuff. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8545.0s)]
*  So the guys in the back as they're doing this, a lot of them put their matches together [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8547.960000000001s)]
*  beforehand, move for move, and then they go out there and they do it. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8552.84s)]
*  My generation was taught differently and was a bit more like, um, [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8557.24s)]
*  have a premise of where you want to go, start to go there, but if it's not working, [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8563.48s)]
*  you have to go in a different direction. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8567.48s)]
*  You can do that on the fly, you know, um, not as a brag, it's just a different [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8569.4s)]
*  generational thing. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8574.84s)]
*  So like I've gone, I wrestled taker at WrestleMania one time and like, [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8575.720000000001s)]
*  we sort of put together the finish and it was, you know, like, I don't know, the finish was [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8582.6s)]
*  probably 15 minutes long or whatever. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8587.56s)]
*  We knew where we wanted to go with the finish. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8589.720000000001s)]
*  And then we'd sort of put it together and now it's early that day. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8591.4s)]
*  And I went to take it. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8594.84s)]
*  I'm like, we get the, the finish finally down. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8596.52s)]
*  Now you want to talk about the rest things like, they just call it out there. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8599.24s)]
*  All right. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8603.48s)]
*  That sounds fun. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8604.119999999999s)]
*  I wonder if it's more believable that way. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8605.4s)]
*  I feel like it is because you don't know. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8607.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8609.8s)]
*  And there's times sometimes when you have all that stuff laid out where it starts to [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8610.44s)]
*  look dancy and people are just going to the next thing. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8614.44s)]
*  You want to be like jazz. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8617.48s)]
*  I want to improvise. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8618.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8619.800000000001s)]
*  I think that's the trick. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8620.2s)]
*  Like in your business, I would imagine that comedians start to get to a place where they [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8621.08s)]
*  know the reaction and then they just start to go with what they believe is going to happen. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8625.960000000001s)]
*  Like I'm always more impressed with a comedian that's like doing something and then somebody [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8630.84s)]
*  heckles them and he like just goes on for six minutes and rips his person a new asshole and [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8636.6s)]
*  does all this stuff that you know, like there's no way that was planned. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8641.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8644.68s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8645.16s)]
*  To me, that's impressive. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8645.720000000001s)]
*  It's off the cuff. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8648.919999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8649.72s)]
*  You just go do your stick and repeat your stuff. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8649.88s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8654.839999999998s)]
*  It's still an incredible skill set that I don't have. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8655.56s)]
*  And then, you know, the very few one, you know, tiny infinitesimal amount of people [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8657.96s)]
*  have that skill set. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8663.32s)]
*  But the other one where you just off the cuff. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8665.24s)]
*  But you have it. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8668.039999999999s)]
*  You have it. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8668.919999999998s)]
*  And you're just that to me. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8670.039999999999s)]
*  And the audience feels that too. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8671.32s)]
*  And the best version of it is if they think the entire thing is more or less that. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8672.92s)]
*  So like you're in a joke, but then there may be are parts of that joke where the audience [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8679.32s)]
*  is going, wait, is he kind of riffing this? [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8683.720000000001s)]
*  Is he reacting to it? [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8685.24s)]
*  That's what I was going to say. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8686.04s)]
*  To me, then the art form becomes when you have it down to a science, [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8687.560000000001s)]
*  how do you make it feel? [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8691.08s)]
*  You still go out there and make it seem like it's the first time you've ever said it. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8691.640000000001s)]
*  And sometimes you got to lie, not lie to yourself, but sometimes you got to trick yourself. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8694.84s)]
*  Sometimes you got to get into the joke, at least for me, differently. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8698.2s)]
*  Every night, I'm going to purposely put myself in a situation where [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8702.119999999999s)]
*  I haven't said it like this and then see what happens. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8706.44s)]
*  And then maybe a new line comes around. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8708.84s)]
*  But they can feel my excitement and energy. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8710.84s)]
*  Dude, there's a weird thing in comedy where you'll try a new joke and they'll react to it. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8713.16s)]
*  And you'll walk off stage like, I got a killer. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8717.64s)]
*  And then you'll listen to it and you'll be like, that bombed. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8719.72s)]
*  What the fuck just happened? [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8721.96s)]
*  And it's simply like you're excited about it. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8723.24s)]
*  So the little reaction that they think is way bigger. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8726.44s)]
*  They give me something. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8729.4s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8730.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8731.08s)]
*  But I think they can get almost like they feed off of your excitement, authenticity. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8731.560000000001s)]
*  I think there's stuff in our business where sometimes talent, like I don't understand why. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8737.640000000001s)]
*  Why am I not the cop guy? [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8743.240000000002s)]
*  I hear my reaction. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8744.76s)]
*  I get every night. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8745.720000000001s)]
*  You hear the reaction you get every night. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8747.720000000001s)]
*  You're not out there for the other reaction. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8749.480000000001s)]
*  Also, the expectation might be way less for your reaction [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8752.76s)]
*  because you're not the top guy. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8756.36s)]
*  You're a guy earlier in the card. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8757.96s)]
*  And then when they're going crazy, they're not there to only see you. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8759.48s)]
*  The main event expectation is a different fucking ball game. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8763.0s)]
*  It's different. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8766.119999999999s)]
*  You know, to explain that to somebody is tough. [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8768.679999999998s)]
*  Right? [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8770.919999999998s)]
*  It hurts their ego. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8771.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8772.199999999999s)]
*  It wasn't as big as you thought it was. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8773.24s)]
*  No, it was. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8774.839999999998s)]
*  I heard it. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8775.4s)]
*  I heard it too. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8776.919999999998s)]
*  You were saying you had a friend in comedy when you were coming up. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8777.64s)]
*  Before I got into the wrestling business, trying to get into the wrestling business, [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8782.599999999999s)]
*  I ran gyms where I lived and all that stuff. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8785.0s)]
*  And there was a guy that was trying to be a stand-up comedian. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8786.84s)]
*  And I don't think he even made it. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8791.8s)]
*  I never heard of him after that. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8793.880000000001s)]
*  But he was taking... [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8795.0s)]
*  There was like... [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8797.08s)]
*  It was at the time when comedy was really taking off. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8797.64s)]
*  Since maybe the 80s? [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8801.08s)]
*  Yeah, late 80s and shit. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8802.04s)]
*  Comedy was huge. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8803.8s)]
*  Huge. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8804.6s)]
*  Like just massive. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8805.08s)]
*  And he was trying to do it. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8806.12s)]
*  He was taking a class. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8807.0s)]
*  I remember him telling me, [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8809.960000000001s)]
*  like, I'm enrolled in this class with this guy who's a famous comedian. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8810.76s)]
*  I don't remember the name. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8813.960000000001s)]
*  I was like, fuck, you're taking comedian classes. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8815.72s)]
*  I didn't even know that was a thing. [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8818.119999999999s)]
*  It just dawned on me. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8819.24s)]
*  But then I was like, well, I guess, sort of like what we do, [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8820.44s)]
*  like what I'm trying to do. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8822.76s)]
*  But he would tell me... [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8824.84s)]
*  He'd come in and he'd be trying shit out on me all the time. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8826.44s)]
*  But then he'd be telling me things that he learned about callbacks and different things. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8828.52s)]
*  And it's the same thing. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8833.56s)]
*  We're just physically... [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8836.92s)]
*  You go out there, comedians go out there and they tell a story. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8839.72s)]
*  And over a long period of time, they tell this story and there's bits and pieces of the story [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8843.0s)]
*  that ebb and flow and bring it back to the beginning. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8847.24s)]
*  And when you don't know the jokes come in and the guy's telling a story, they think, [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8849.32s)]
*  wow, all of a sudden you got real serious. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8852.92s)]
*  Then he hits you with the thing. [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8854.12s)]
*  When you least expect it, yeah. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8855.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8856.76s)]
*  It's the distract. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8857.400000000001s)]
*  It's the... [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8858.76s)]
*  All these things are the same in our business. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8860.12s)]
*  Just the medium of which we paint the picture is different. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8863.800000000001s)]
*  I was the victim of one of yours. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8868.76s)]
*  Yeah, that was fucked up. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8871.16s)]
*  I know. [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8872.92s)]
*  I was the victim of Logan. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8873.400000000001s)]
*  No, no. [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8874.92s)]
*  I... [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8875.400000000001s)]
*  Be honest. [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8876.44s)]
*  Did you have any... [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8876.84s)]
*  I think you had... [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8878.28s)]
*  Who moved my seats? [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8880.12s)]
*  That's all I want to know. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8881.08s)]
*  Logan, if a top star comes to me and asks... [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8883.720000000001s)]
*  Don't work me. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8887.880000000001s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8888.6s)]
*  That was getting diplomatic. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8889.320000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8890.44s)]
*  But the top star comes and says like, hey, it's Sonzo is here, right? [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8891.24s)]
*  Yes, he is. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8895.640000000001s)]
*  Where's he sitting? [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8896.2s)]
*  Over there. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8896.92s)]
*  Hey, would they move him over here? [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8897.560000000001s)]
*  I'd like to address him in the crowd. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8899.24s)]
*  Like, okay. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8900.76s)]
*  I mean, top star is generous. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8901.88s)]
*  We have a part timer. [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8905.0s)]
*  You're going to let a part timer do that? [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8906.119999999999s)]
*  A guy that thinks he's a top star. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8907.88s)]
*  Okay, fair enough. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8909.32s)]
*  I'm just saying... [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8910.92s)]
*  Probably he's going to show me this and be like, are you serious, bro? [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8911.48s)]
*  Because we're seated initially with all the other dudes that are behind McAfee and Call. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8915.24s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, last second, we get seated over there. [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8921.4s)]
*  And my stupid ego is like, oh, I've done Madison Square Garden before. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8923.64s)]
*  They want to put me forever out. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8927.4s)]
*  My wife is there. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8928.68s)]
*  I'm all excited, whatever like that. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8929.4s)]
*  And then Logan calls me out. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8931.08s)]
*  And there's a moment where I kind of look and I look at Dove because I'm like, [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8933.16s)]
*  did you fucking do... [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8937.0s)]
*  Like, what the hell is going on? [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8937.960000000001s)]
*  And then he has no clue about what's happened. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8939.32s)]
*  And then when he starts doing shit, he's doing a work on me. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8941.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8945.24s)]
*  Well, put it this way. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8945.880000000001s)]
*  I know that he knows you. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8948.6s)]
*  I know that you guys know each other to a degree. [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8949.960000000001s)]
*  So him saying to me, hey, I know... [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8952.6s)]
*  Where's he sitting? [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8955.480000000001s)]
*  Oh, he's over behind Call. [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8956.28s)]
*  Hey, could you move him over here? [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8958.119999999999s)]
*  Because he wants to be able to address hard camera and still... [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8959.72s)]
*  Oh, so that's how you get the... [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8964.039999999999s)]
*  I see. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8965.48s)]
*  Speak to you, right? [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8966.119999999999s)]
*  So to me, I'm like, okay, well, they're friends. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8967.72s)]
*  He's not going to go over to you and go like... [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8973.32s)]
*  Do exactly that. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8974.84s)]
*  And you're like, bang, you're friends. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8975.8s)]
*  They were friends. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8977.72s)]
*  I thought literally the week... [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8978.359999999999s)]
*  And I think he fucking set me up because like literally... [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8979.8s)]
*  Of course he did. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8982.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah. No, no, he sent me an invite to his fucking wedding. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8982.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8986.039999999999s)]
*  So then when he announced me, I'm like, what is he trying to pull me into? [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8986.86s)]
*  And then he does this whole fucking shit where like now I have to like co-sign his nonsense. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8989.1s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm at home. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8992.86s)]
*  Like you get to wrestle. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8993.900000000001s)]
*  I got to... [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8994.86s)]
*  I see these people every single fucking day. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8995.5s)]
*  So I'm like, you're not going to pull me into this bullshit. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8997.42s)]
*  And especially when you're not even wrestling that you're cutting a promo. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=8999.42s)]
*  That's why I showed up to watch you cut a fucking promo. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9002.300000000001s)]
*  Like I give a fuck. [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9004.54s)]
*  Well, you do realize he's a guy that sort of [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9005.42s)]
*  plies his trade on getting clicks and downloads and... [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9008.62s)]
*  Yeah. So I'm not going to let him do that to me. [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9011.820000000002s)]
*  Well, you sort of did. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9013.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9014.78s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9015.34s)]
*  Logan is fucking lucky that AJ pulled up. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9018.220000000001s)]
*  I put hands on Logan in front of my people, Mazza's Gregor. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9021.66s)]
*  I was shocked. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9024.54s)]
*  These pussy didn't jump in. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9025.1s)]
*  We have a perfect opportunity to bring... [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9026.460000000001s)]
*  What? When would you jump in while you're in there? [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9027.42s)]
*  Why not? [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9029.82s)]
*  This is wrestling. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9030.460000000001s)]
*  This is what it... [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9031.58s)]
*  No, I'm not getting kicked out of Mazza's Gregor. [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9032.54s)]
*  My boys are sitting there watching, eating popcorn like assholes. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9033.18s)]
*  Also because if you get knocked out, this becomes his podcast. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9035.58s)]
*  This is some potential upside. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9041.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9042.94s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9043.74s)]
*  I thought you could take him, bro. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9044.539999999999s)]
*  Man. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9045.74s)]
*  I thought I could too. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9046.22s)]
*  I was totally disappointed, bro. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9047.26s)]
*  He sends it. [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9048.06s)]
*  You actually embarrassed me even more. [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9048.619999999999s)]
*  Now I might have some beef with you. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9050.06s)]
*  You send in this other guy. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9051.74s)]
*  Beautifully does a great job. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9054.38s)]
*  He's jumping over the ropes, everything like that. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9055.5s)]
*  But I'm like, let me do it old fashioned in front of my people. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9057.019999999999s)]
*  I did feel a little bit of disrespect from that. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9060.06s)]
*  Wow, Lacey. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9061.74s)]
*  I've always felt like you thought I couldn't defend myself. [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9062.14s)]
*  No, no. Look, the AJ part was already planned to happen. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9064.22s)]
*  I didn't know he was going to do this stuff with you beforehand. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9066.619999999999s)]
*  So you're basically saying that Logan has the keys to the business. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9071.58s)]
*  Inmates run in the asylum. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9074.539999999999s)]
*  Oh, I am. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9075.58s)]
*  I'm also saying that if I- [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9076.7s)]
*  You might need a punishment is all I'm saying. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9078.06s)]
*  What would Vince do? [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9081.02s)]
*  That's all I'm saying. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9082.06s)]
*  I am saying that if I see a celebrity in the front row of your stature, [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9083.34s)]
*  that if something might happen, it's not terrible for us. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9088.94s)]
*  Wow. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9092.46s)]
*  Okay. Good to know. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9093.34s)]
*  Whether you come out shining or whether it's a little bit at your expense, [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9095.02s)]
*  it's not a terrible thing. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9098.94s)]
*  All right. Well, I just want to let you know that's the last time something like that happens. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9100.14s)]
*  I just feel like that if we go to Madison Square Garden again, I'd like to invite you. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9104.619999999999s)]
*  And then whatever happens to Logan at that event from you is just- [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9108.14s)]
*  All I'm saying is I have a way of getting in there without the metal detectors. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9113.26s)]
*  That's all I'm saying. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9116.14s)]
*  So maybe you want to see me in the bleachers, [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9118.619999999999s)]
*  you want to see me in a nice suite or something like that. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9120.619999999999s)]
*  Because if I'm in the front row, you never know what might happen. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9122.38s)]
*  WrestleMania is two weeks away, so if you want to pop in- [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9125.9s)]
*  I'm busy. I can't go to something like that. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9129.18s)]
*  I can't. I could not. I can't. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9131.82s)]
*  Which is what a guy- [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9133.1s)]
*  That's Easter weekend. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9133.74s)]
*  Which is what a guy would say if he was going to show up on an hour. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9134.7s)]
*  I mean, I'll definitely be there. I'll definitely 100% be there. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9137.74s)]
*  Logan's going to get a paddle racket to the head. [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9142.7s)]
*  This is the beautiful thing about our business is people will debate this shit all day long. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9146.300000000001s)]
*  I say this about our business all the time. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9151.5s)]
*  If you don't like it, there's nothing in the world I can say to you to make you like our business. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9155.18s)]
*  If you do like it, there's no explanation necessary. [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9160.46s)]
*  You just get into it, right? [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9162.699999999999s)]
*  But as into it as you are, there will be moments in time in our show where I could say- [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9164.38s)]
*  somebody will say, like, hey, those two really got at it. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9172.619999999999s)]
*  I was like, no, no, part of the show. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9175.179999999998s)]
*  And then they'll be like, no, no, no, I saw that one. I was there. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9176.939999999999s)]
*  And I know that he did one thing that pissed the other guy off, [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9180.859999999999s)]
*  and then it got real for a second with those two. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9184.06s)]
*  Then you're not sure. [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9186.859999999999s)]
*  It's like trying to explain vagina to gay guys. [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9188.3s)]
*  Or you could flip that scenario too. [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9195.9s)]
*  Them explaining butt to us. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9199.1s)]
*  Some of us have been in there. [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9201.1s)]
*  I've got one, but I don't know that I'm buying the explanation. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9203.34s)]
*  But when we tug on it, it's fun. You almost understand them. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9207.34s)]
*  Anyway, listen, he's going to get out of here. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9211.74s)]
*  I'm sorry. You say the pendulum swings. [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9215.66s)]
*  I was a big fan of the Attitude Era. [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9218.06s)]
*  Where would you say you guys are at right now? [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9220.22s)]
*  Is the WWE in the second coming Attitude Era or a little plane in a little state? [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9225.5s)]
*  I say this a bunch. [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9232.3s)]
*  Well, look, you have to play to what is acceptable in the world. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9233.5s)]
*  Because you can say like in the Attitude Era, well, a lot of that stuff wasn't acceptable. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9237.9s)]
*  No, yeah, it was. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9241.5s)]
*  It was normal. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9243.179999999998s)]
*  My kids were going to school and saying it every day and doing all the stuff and wearing the shirts [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9243.74s)]
*  and all the things. There are certain things that are acceptable, certain things that are not. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9247.099999999999s)]
*  In the moments in time, we have to work with our partners, obviously, and what can work [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9251.42s)]
*  and what can't work. And there's leeway in that. [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9256.779999999999s)]
*  But as a guy that sat front row and center as the Attitude Era was becoming and then what it would [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9258.939999999999s)]
*  become, we're in that same zone of- [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9266.06s)]
*  Gotcha. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9268.939999999999s)]
*  Pushing the envelope. [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9269.5s)]
*  Pushing the envelope, but also of mainstream acceptance of- [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9271.179999999998s)]
*  Oh, you feel it. It's on my Netflix every day. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9274.699999999999s)]
*  You feel it. [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9277.66s)]
*  Yeah, and it's global. We are, you see us now kind of, we've always been a global product, [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9278.14s)]
*  but now is sort of the first time that I think we can capitalize on that, where we can go [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9285.58s)]
*  any place on the planet. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9290.3s)]
*  You guys are in Europe. I was seeing you guys sell out these arenas in Europe. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9291.82s)]
*  In Europe. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9294.539999999999s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9295.179999999998s)]
*  And they're chanting their own soccer chants because- [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9295.74s)]
*  They just want to be part of the show. They don't know how to do it outside of- [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9299.259999999998s)]
*  This year we'll be in France and Paris. That'll be off the charts. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9302.22s)]
*  We're going to go to Perth again, and Australia, the Middle East is always off the charts. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9305.42s)]
*  And we haven't even touched South America, go to Mexico, like all these things that are upcoming [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9311.42s)]
*  and we will be doing. [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9316.3s)]
*  You've got to go to the Middle East and then tell them all that Sammy Zane is really from Ireland. [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9319.42s)]
*  The biggest heel turn ever. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9325.099999999999s)]
*  Very last question. You guys are under the same umbrella. Are we going to see any UFC guys make [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9326.619999999999s)]
*  that jump into- [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9331.74s)]
*  You know, it's one of the things, like it just depends on who's an entertainer and who's- [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9332.699999999999s)]
*  Oh, so it's a possibility. [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9338.939999999999s)]
*  Yeah. There's always that possibility. Look, Brock Lesnar, Rhonda. [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9340.14s)]
*  There's always that possibility. We're always wide open to it. [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9343.9s)]
*  You know, I think there's also possibilities that as we are recruiting now, [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9349.339999999998s)]
*  D1 athletes coming out of colleges and our, you know, our NIL program and everything else [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9353.82s)]
*  of how we're recruiting, there are people that are coming into us that want to do [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9360.7s)]
*  WWE style entertainment for a living, but are like- [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9365.98s)]
*  I might want some of that UFC stuff. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9369.02s)]
*  Look, I'd dip my toe in that water of taking a shot at UFC if I could. And, [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9370.380000000001s)]
*  you know, whether that's realistic or whether it's not, like some of those guys have [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9376.300000000001s)]
*  massive amateur backgrounds and have trained in that stuff, but are looking to do what we do, [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9380.3s)]
*  but would also throw their hat in that ring. So who knows? You know, I would say never say never [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9385.66s)]
*  on that. I would say the bigger collaboration between us and UFC is what you're seeing happen [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9392.3s)]
*  now where we're like going into areas and sort of doing like a, almost like a weekend kind of [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9397.179999999998s)]
*  takeover thing where we go in with making this up by the SmackDown on a Friday night, [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9402.619999999999s)]
*  and then UFC is in there on a Saturday and then we're in there with something on a Sunday, [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9407.9s)]
*  and then we do a Monday Night Raw and, you know, we've gone in there and done this whole [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9412.539999999999s)]
*  sort of weekend takeover of stuff. I think seeing bits and pieces of things like that, [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9417.18s)]
*  and, you know, with the inclusion also within TKO of, you know, pro bull riding and all that stuff [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9422.3s)]
*  now, there's just a lot of- It's an entertainment conglomerate. [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9428.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of avenues on that. And that's going to breed crossover for- [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9431.82s)]
*  Yeah, and live events. You know, it's funny to me that people make sometimes the distinction [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9434.86s)]
*  between sport and everything's entertainment. Everything's entertainment. You know, it's all [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9439.5s)]
*  entertainment. And what I love is that we are sort of the ultimate variety show and we can do a bit [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9444.380000000001s)]
*  of everything so we can have, you know, stuff can be serious, it can be emotional, it can be make [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9450.62s)]
*  you angry, it can make you laugh, we can have comedians on, we can have musicians on, we can [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9456.78s)]
*  have bad bunny wrestling in a match. He's awesome by the way. [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9460.94s)]
*  Incredible, right? We can have Travis Scott there, we can have you there, we can have- [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9463.74s)]
*  We can include so many things and be a part of just everything. And I think you see that resonating [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9469.1s)]
*  across society where as big as it was in the attitude era, we were still seen as like this [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9475.26s)]
*  crazy offshoot thing. And now it feels like it's a part of culture. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9483.66s)]
*  Yeah. It very much is just a part of culture and a part of everybody's [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9487.5s)]
*  sort of everyday vernacular. The amount of times I hear our insider terms being used [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9494.78s)]
*  in the regular world now is- Oh, kayfabe, babyface. This is just common parlance. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9500.06s)]
*  It's just every- Gimroni. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9504.54s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Dude, okay, last, I know you got to go. There is a wrestler in New York City. His [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9505.82s)]
*  name is Tommy Invincible. He is the purest white meat babyface. [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9511.1s)]
*  Does he have a mustache and a- [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9516.300000000001s)]
*  He's nothing like that. That guy's not a wrestler. That's just a civilian that was [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9518.300000000001s)]
*  taken advantage of and does not need his redemption because I'm a Buddhist now and I don't care about [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9521.42s)]
*  that kind of stuff. And I'm not going to be used for fucking clicks ever again. [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9527.18s)]
*  Yeah, you're above it. [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9530.220000000001s)]
*  Okay? But if you show up in my neighborhood, I get popped. This guy, Tommy Invincible, [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9530.94s)]
*  I'm obsessed with. I watch every single Instagram he puts out. Okay, I would be upset if I did not [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9535.02s)]
*  notice that he is right now the United States Bronx champion. It is going to blow his fucking [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9539.74s)]
*  mind that I'm talking to him about you right now. But I'm telling you, this guy is absolutely [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9543.66s)]
*  phenomenal. Okay? And he is a lifer. He's dedicated his life to this thing and he is incredible. [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9550.3s)]
*  And I just want to put him on your radar. [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9555.9s)]
*  Well, they're even standing outside the performance center, so clearly he's on the radar. [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9556.619999999999s)]
*  Of course, yeah. He's definitely- [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9558.78s)]
*  I will, look, in my position now, I have a team of people that are across all this stuff, so I [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9561.1s)]
*  guarantee you they know who he is and we'll get eyes on him. [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9568.3s)]
*  Tommy, you're going to make everyone feel invincible, bro. Okay, Triple H. Thank you so much. [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBHeBL8G_A&t=9570.699999999999s)]
