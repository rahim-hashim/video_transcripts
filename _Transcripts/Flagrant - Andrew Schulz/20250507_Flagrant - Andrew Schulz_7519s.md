**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA)
*  I played with Mark the other day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=0.0s)]
*  Paddle? [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2.1s)]
*  Sanchez? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2.6s)]
*  Pure ass. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3.1s)]
*  What's interesting is Al might not have been the weakest link. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4.1s)]
*  Vala wasn't bad. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  So Vala's still the worst? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  No, Vala plays every day. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=9.6s)]
*  There's no way. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=11.6s)]
*  Oh god. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=12.6s)]
*  Oh god. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=13.6s)]
*  If he is going to watch this it'd be crushing. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=14.6s)]
*  He's been working so hard. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=17.6s)]
*  I know. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=18.6s)]
*  He plays all the time. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=19.6s)]
*  He's on group chats. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=20.6s)]
*  He's developing paddle culture stuff. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=21.6s)]
*  And you have a baby, you take seven months off and you wipe the floor with him. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=23.6s)]
*  Nerve damage to one of his legs. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=28.700000000000003s)]
*  Is that present at all when he was playing? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=29.700000000000003s)]
*  It's both. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=31.700000000000003s)]
*  Both? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=32.7s)]
*  And he's not even here. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=33.7s)]
*  I wish he was. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=34.7s)]
*  Can we call him? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=35.7s)]
*  You saw, dude, Mark is talking shit. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=36.7s)]
*  He said he busted your ass in paddle. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=38.2s)]
*  Stop, stop. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=40.2s)]
*  No, no, no, he's full of shit. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=41.2s)]
*  First of all, I won with everyone I played with. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=43.2s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=46.2s)]
*  He played with Al and they got bagel. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=47.2s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=48.2s)]
*  He lost 6-2 because it was Al that said he was full. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=49.2s)]
*  Mark said he came on the pod and he goes, I think Vala has nerve damage in both legs. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=53.2s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=59.2s)]
*  I did not say that, Vala. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=60.2s)]
*  That's fucked up. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=61.2s)]
*  And he knew you weren't going to be here so he knew you could talk shit without you doing your act outs. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=62.2s)]
*  Let's set it up. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=68.2s)]
*  When I'm back on Wednesday, let's set it up. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=69.2s)]
*  Alright, dude, we'll set it up. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=71.2s)]
*  Alright. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=72.2s)]
*  We love you. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=73.2s)]
*  Bye. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=74.2s)]
*  Bye, Vala. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=75.2s)]
*  Damn, you and Vala got like an interesting rivalry. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=76.2s)]
*  What's that about, you think? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=78.2s)]
*  I think... [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=79.2s)]
*  Chifty is not allowed to have joy today. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=84.2s)]
*  Chifty, we're being sad and bitter today. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=86.2s)]
*  Chifty is about to have the youngest hip and leg transplant in history, something Vala [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=88.8s)]
*  should have done two decades ago. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=93.0s)]
*  Today is our bitter sad day and then once we process all this bitterness and sadness [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=95.0s)]
*  we move on. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=99.0s)]
*  But if you find Chifty laughing throughout the episode, we have to stop the pilot and [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=100.0s)]
*  acknowledge it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=103.0s)]
*  But do it after the summertime. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=104.0s)]
*  Don't do it now. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=105.0s)]
*  Wait, what do you mean? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=106.0s)]
*  He's in pain. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=107.0s)]
*  He's in chronic pain. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=108.0s)]
*  He's been walking off for a couple months. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=109.0s)]
*  He's been walking off for a year. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=111.0s)]
*  He got hit by a car twice. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=112.0s)]
*  This fucking idiot. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=113.0s)]
*  He's an idiot. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=114.0s)]
*  That is his fault. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=115.0s)]
*  The insurance company is denying defendants. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=116.8s)]
*  He's about to shoot Brian Thompson again. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=118.8s)]
*  Yeah, 100% [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=121.8s)]
*  He's about to go at him for autonomy. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=124.8s)]
*  Chifty, no more joy. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=126.8s)]
*  Can we get a cam on Chifty? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=128.8s)]
*  Can we get a joy cam on Chifty? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=129.8s)]
*  He does have a Luigi vibe, doesn't he? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=130.8s)]
*  Chifty's got super Luigi-coded energy. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=133.8s)]
*  He does kind of look like it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=135.8s)]
*  Okay, Chifty, can you tell us why you were giggling when I said that Vala and Mark have [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=137.8s)]
*  a little rivalry? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=141.8s)]
*  Can you tell us that, please? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=142.8s)]
*  In the most sad, sardonic way possible. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=144.60000000000002s)]
*  Mark, you remember when you crushed Vala's sushi in front of him? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=146.60000000000002s)]
*  Wait, what happened? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=149.60000000000002s)]
*  We were filming that video for the Toronto promo and we were all eating out there and [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=150.60000000000002s)]
*  Vala said something smart to you and you didn't have a slick comeback or anything, so you [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=155.60000000000002s)]
*  just took your thumb and he was eating sushi and he was all happy and you mushed his sushi. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=160.4s)]
*  And Vala went from laughing like ha ha ha to truly serious. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=165.4s)]
*  So mad. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=173.0s)]
*  And then Mark... [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=174.0s)]
*  We're not learning that from him. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=175.0s)]
*  We're not learning that from him. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=177.0s)]
*  Sometimes you don't need a slick comeback. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=179.0s)]
*  Sometimes you need to put your palm on somebody's sushi platter and it works just as good. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=182.0s)]
*  Oh no, Mark. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=187.0s)]
*  You can become a tyrant. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=189.0s)]
*  Vala always starts it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=191.0s)]
*  I don't like this idea that I'm bullying Vala. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=193.0s)]
*  Okay, because he's like... [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=195.0s)]
*  Mark said he mushed your sushi one day. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=199.0s)]
*  He didn't do shit. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=202.0s)]
*  Mark said he walked up to your sushi platter and he put his thumb in your spicy tuna roll [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=208.0s)]
*  and mushed it and you did nothing. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=214.0s)]
*  You sat there and took it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=216.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=218.0s)]
*  I've been waiting for him to have a kid so I can push this. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=219.0s)]
*  Damn, bro! [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=222.0s)]
*  You didn't have to go full pocket stuff on it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=224.0s)]
*  He just gossaged your kid. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=229.0s)]
*  Damn, bro! Why you going after the kids? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=232.0s)]
*  Damn, I gotta hang up before this shit gets too serious. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=235.0s)]
*  Jesus, we were just having fun. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=239.0s)]
*  This guy went nuclear. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=241.0s)]
*  Hey, listen, free Kashmir, bro. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=243.0s)]
*  I get it now, Hindustan. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=245.0s)]
*  I get it now, Hindustan. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=247.0s)]
*  Damn, bro, what the fuck? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=249.0s)]
*  He's still upset about that sushi mush. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=251.0s)]
*  Love 40, bro. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=253.0s)]
*  That's me and Vala's whole relationship. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=255.0s)]
*  What? You had him love 40? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=257.0s)]
*  Yeah, just in life. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=259.0s)]
*  I'm just a point away from decimating. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=261.0s)]
*  Yo, that is so fucked up! [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=263.0s)]
*  It's just love 40. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=265.0s)]
*  That is so fucked up! [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=267.0s)]
*  That is 90 years! [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=269.0s)]
*  That is a bar, bro. I am gonna use that. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=271.0s)]
*  I think it's 40 love, though. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=273.0s)]
*  You're serving, right? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=275.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=277.0s)]
*  I mean, love 40 sounds like he's losing. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=279.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, but it was still fun. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=281.0s)]
*  We got it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=283.0s)]
*  But obviously now that everybody listens to the podcast, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=285.0s)]
*  it's a, you know, paddle of fish and not a... [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=287.0s)]
*  I might be confused about that. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=291.0s)]
*  Oh, guys! [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=293.0s)]
*  Okay, so what was gayer last night? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=295.0s)]
*  Last of Us or the Met Gala? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=297.0s)]
*  What do you want to talk about? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=299.0s)]
*  Oh, well, can you explain Last of Us? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=301.0s)]
*  Yo, can I tell you something about this? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=303.0s)]
*  So the video game was gay. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=305.0s)]
*  They had like a lesbian thing in it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=307.0s)]
*  And you had to do the mission gay? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=309.0s)]
*  You have to do it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=311.0s)]
*  Yo, that's really funny. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=313.0s)]
*  They don't shift it. You're laughing and feeling joyful again. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=315.0s)]
*  I don't like you laughing and feeling joyful up there. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=317.0s)]
*  So are you upset that the TV show is accurate to the game and they include the gay shit? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=319.0s)]
*  No, why are you assuming I'm upset? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=321.0s)]
*  You watched the first thing you break up. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=323.0s)]
*  What was more gay? The Met Gala or the show? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=325.0s)]
*  But it might be positive. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=327.0s)]
*  Look how gay the world is. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=329.0s)]
*  Yes, finally. Look at how gay he's sitting. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=331.0s)]
*  Yeah, look at me. You think I'm gonna be upset at gay shit? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=333.0s)]
*  40 love, suck it. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=335.0s)]
*  40 love sounds better. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=337.0s)]
*  So, uh, no, like, okay, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=341.0s)]
*  So I had a thought about while watching The Last of Us because I played the video game. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=343.0s)]
*  It was obviously very traumatic for me when the little lesbian girl started making out and having sex. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=345.0s)]
*  Because I've known Ellie the character since she was a teenager. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=349.0s)]
*  I don't want to watch this girl. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=351.0s)]
*  She's like a daughter to me practically. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=353.0s)]
*  Now she's a fully grown lesbian and she's just fingering somebody dirty. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=355.0s)]
*  The Allen horseback for four days, no shower. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=357.0s)]
*  There's a lot of things going on. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=359.0s)]
*  Also, they didn't need to show the fingering scene. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=361.0s)]
*  That was a little much. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=363.0s)]
*  I know I'm becoming an old man. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=365.0s)]
*  See? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=367.0s)]
*  She's not even a seasoned lesbian. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=369.0s)]
*  Doesn't even unbuckle her belt. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=371.0s)]
*  What does she do? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=373.0s)]
*  She's pulling at the jeans, trying to stomp the hand underneath her. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=375.0s)]
*  Her wrist is all caught. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=377.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=379.0s)]
*  Like a puppet? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=381.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what it is. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=383.0s)]
*  Anyway, so I was watching and I'm curious. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=385.0s)]
*  You know how like Hollywood, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=387.0s)]
*  Hollywood wants to make money. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=389.0s)]
*  We understand. This is the point of Hollywood. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=391.0s)]
*  And then sometimes there's virtuous people caught up in every industry. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=393.0s)]
*  And they start like putting, you know, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=395.0s)]
*  Justifications on their actions like we all do that make them seem a little bit like more benevolent. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=397.0s)]
*  Right? Fair enough. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=399.0s)]
*  So, but in my experience, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=401.0s)]
*  Hollywood is very reactive. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=403.0s)]
*  Like a movie about ice skating does really well. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=405.0s)]
*  There'll be five more ice skating movies. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=407.0s)]
*  Right? Horror movies do well. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=409.0s)]
*  They go, OK, horror is in. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=411.0s)]
*  Horror rated comedy does well. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=413.0s)]
*  OK, let's make horror rated comedy. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=415.0s)]
*  So what I think is happening with like the, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=417.0s)]
*  you call DI or, you know, like trans stories or gay stories, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=419.0s)]
*  whatever it is, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=421.0s)]
*  is that they're not going to be able to do it. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=423.0s)]
*  Like, you know, like trans stories or gay stories, whatever it is. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=425.0s)]
*  Like what I think has happened is there [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=427.0s)]
*  was some very brave filmmakers [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=429.0s)]
*  like Brokeback Mountain. That could have been a huge [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=431.0s)]
*  fucking flop. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=433.0s)]
*  Right? You put this movie out there like, hold on, gay cowboys? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=435.0s)]
*  Like who's going to go watch this? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=437.0s)]
*  And despite the fact that it could have been [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=439.0s)]
*  a huge flop, the actors [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=441.0s)]
*  in it were brave for doing it. It's not like there's [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=443.0s)]
*  like all this reward for doing a gay scene. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=445.0s)]
*  At the time, like, you could look at those characters [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=447.0s)]
*  and be like, ah, they're gay now. I don't want to see [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=449.0s)]
*  them in action movies. They might lose their role in Hollywood. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=451.0s)]
*  But they're courageous. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=453.0s)]
*  The movie, just as a theory, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=455.0s)]
*  movie does really well because it's a good movie, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=457.0s)]
*  but it's also like brave and courageous. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=459.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=461.0s)]
*  The Hollywood industry [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=463.0s)]
*  reacts and goes, oh, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=465.0s)]
*  that makes money. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=467.0s)]
*  Let's do the gay shit. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=469.0s)]
*  And then the executives, lower level, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=471.0s)]
*  start going, we have to share [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=473.0s)]
*  these marginalized stories. We have to [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=475.0s)]
*  do it. And they might actually believe that shit. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=477.0s)]
*  But at the top, they're just reacting [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=479.0s)]
*  to whatever's successful. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=481.0s)]
*  Once the top is [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=483.0s)]
*  forcing in [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=485.0s)]
*  stories that they don't actually [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=487.0s)]
*  really care about, they're just doing it to make money, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=489.0s)]
*  the people see it as forced. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=491.0s)]
*  If it's an authentic, pure [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=493.0s)]
*  story, it doesn't matter if it's gay or not [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=495.0s)]
*  or it's DEI or not. Like, Jordan [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=497.0s)]
*  Poole's shit isn't DEI. We just like it [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=499.0s)]
*  because it's cool. Jordan Peele, right? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=501.0s)]
*  Yeah, Poole. Sorry, Jordan. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=503.0s)]
*  Yeah, my bad, my bad, Jordan. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=505.0s)]
*  One of them is really good. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=507.0s)]
*  So Jordan's Peele stories [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=509.0s)]
*  really work because they're like authentic, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=511.0s)]
*  right? And the crowd reacts to it [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=513.0s)]
*  because they're authentic. It doesn't feel forced. When [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=515.0s)]
*  the forced shit happens, we go, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=517.0s)]
*  ah, this is stupid. And then we find [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=519.0s)]
*  reasons, we justify the blame why it [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=521.0s)]
*  sucks. We're like, oh, this is DEI, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=523.0s)]
*  this is the other thing. No, no, it's just inauthentic. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=525.0s)]
*  It's late. And it's no [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=527.0s)]
*  longer rebellious. It's no longer shocking. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=529.0s)]
*  It's no longer different. It just feels like they're cashing in on this idea. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=531.0s)]
*  Here's the problem. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=534.0s)]
*  When the tech [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=536.0s)]
*  industry wants to cure cancer, they do it [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=538.0s)]
*  for money and they're very open about it. They're like, we think we can make money [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=540.0s)]
*  curing cancer. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=542.0s)]
*  Like this drug might help it or whatever it is. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=544.0s)]
*  We can use AI to like locate it early [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=546.0s)]
*  and then remove it, whatever. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=548.0s)]
*  If it can't make money, they're like, alright, we can't deploy [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=550.0s)]
*  cash towards that. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=552.0s)]
*  Hollywood has already [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=554.0s)]
*  made their bed with [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=556.0s)]
*  we're doing this because it's important to share [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=558.0s)]
*  marginalized stories. Once [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=560.0s)]
*  those stories stop making money, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=562.0s)]
*  the execs at the top are like, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=564.0s)]
*  damn, we already told everybody we're doing this [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=566.0s)]
*  because it's beneficial to the world. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=568.0s)]
*  When in reality, we're just doing it to make money. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=570.0s)]
*  So now we can't exactly pivot [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=572.0s)]
*  off of it too fast [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=574.0s)]
*  because then it's going to expose the lie [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=576.0s)]
*  that we were doing this for some benevolent reason [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=578.0s)]
*  in the first place. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=580.0s)]
*  Thoughts? Yeah, I mean, Bezos has a quote [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=582.0s)]
*  where he, it went viral on Twitter [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=584.0s)]
*  recently, where he was like, in order to get [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=586.0s)]
*  outsized gains, you have to bat against conventional wisdom. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=588.0s)]
*  So like, if you go against the grain, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=590.0s)]
*  you're going to strike out nine times. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=592.0s)]
*  But if you hit it, you have potentially a thousand [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=594.0s)]
*  extra reward. So I think that happens in the film [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=596.0s)]
*  industry. We're going against conventional wisdom. Let's make a gay [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=598.0s)]
*  cowboy movie. It goes crazy. And then, of course, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=600.0s)]
*  everyone chases. I think that happens in every industry. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=602.0s)]
*  To bring that up now, though, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=604.0s)]
*  this is the game. They're [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=606.0s)]
*  being accurate to the game. I'm actually [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=608.0s)]
*  saying the game is not a good example. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=610.0s)]
*  But it gave me [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=612.0s)]
*  it just gave me like an idea about the [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=614.0s)]
*  industry in general. But you're not [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=616.0s)]
*  saying that this episode of Last of Us [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=618.0s)]
*  felt forced. No, no, no, no. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=620.0s)]
*  When I first played the game, I'm sure we can look [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=622.0s)]
*  back at it. And I probably have a completely different opinion than I have right now. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=624.0s)]
*  Apocryptus. Apocryptus, yeah. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=626.0s)]
*  But like, when [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=628.0s)]
*  I played the game, I was like, is this forced? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=630.0s)]
*  Are they trying to be progressive? Has it [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=632.0s)]
*  always been a kind of progressive pushing show? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=634.0s)]
*  Like, was the video game [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=636.0s)]
*  industry very scrutinized? Like, what was [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=638.0s)]
*  happening at the time when it came out, Shifty? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=640.0s)]
*  Do you remember? Like, with the reaction of it? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=642.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it hadn't [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=644.0s)]
*  really happened to have like the character, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=646.0s)]
*  like a main woman character be gay like that [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=648.0s)]
*  in the video game. Because I remember kind [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=650.0s)]
*  of like around this time, remember [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=652.0s)]
*  there was this big thing in video games where [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=654.0s)]
*  they were super sexist and this was like [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=656.0s)]
*  tangentially related to me too. And like [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=658.0s)]
*  they were over-sexualized, etc. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=660.0s)]
*  So it was the complete opposite. But also the dudes [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=662.0s)]
*  So it was rebellious, you could make sense. The dudes [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=664.0s)]
*  were gay before that though, right? Who? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=666.0s)]
*  In Last of Us. Oh, they had the gay dudes [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=668.0s)]
*  but in Last of Us, it wasn't that big a [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=670.0s)]
*  deal. Right, it was like kind of subtle. It was barely [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=672.0s)]
*  even mentioned. And then the episode they made out [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=674.0s)]
*  of it was fucking incredible. Right. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=676.0s)]
*  And I think that was also transformed. They just made a [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=678.0s)]
*  dope episode. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=680.0s)]
*  And we all liked it and it felt authentic, it didn't [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=682.0s)]
*  feel forced. So here's the unfortunate [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=684.0s)]
*  thing. You [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=686.0s)]
*  do something that's no longer rebellious, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=688.0s)]
*  it becomes the norm, and it feels inauthentic. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=690.0s)]
*  And then there are people [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=692.0s)]
*  that are creating authentic stories [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=694.0s)]
*  that are like that. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=696.0s)]
*  But unfortunately, because everything around [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=698.0s)]
*  it feels so inauthentic, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=700.0s)]
*  it gets jumbled into it. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=702.0s)]
*  Yeah. So while [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=704.0s)]
*  this was a rebellious story to tell [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=706.0s)]
*  in video games, the five years [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=708.0s)]
*  ago or seven years ago whenever they started writing it, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=710.0s)]
*  now because of like the [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=712.0s)]
*  trend around forced diversity, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=714.0s)]
*  it can get looped in [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=716.0s)]
*  into that. Which is like, it's [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=718.0s)]
*  unfair to that because it's authentic to the game. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=720.0s)]
*  I think it happens, like [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=722.0s)]
*  you mentioned the medical industry, I think they [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=724.0s)]
*  also sometimes couch stuff in like flowery [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=726.0s)]
*  language to make it seem like [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=728.0s)]
*  our mission [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=730.0s)]
*  is, you know, someone in my family had cancer [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=732.0s)]
*  and so we're doing cancer research, da da da. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=734.0s)]
*  And it's like, okay, it might be that also. Again, it's hard to [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=736.0s)]
*  judge people's internal intentions, but [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=738.0s)]
*  there's also the financial component, obviously. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=740.0s)]
*  So I think every industry, like, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=742.0s)]
*  their motivation is ultimately financial, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=744.0s)]
*  but they will kind of frame stuff [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=746.0s)]
*  and like, oh, our brand statement is [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=748.0s)]
*  make people fit or make people [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=750.0s)]
*  smarter, but it's like, okay, it's that plus [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=752.0s)]
*  money. I wonder if they were honest [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=754.0s)]
*  about it from the jump, like they are about [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=756.0s)]
*  different genres of film. Like if [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=758.0s)]
*  R-rated comedies are popping and then a bunch of other [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=760.0s)]
*  R-rated comedies come out, it's like, they're like, yeah, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=762.0s)]
*  this is really successful right now, so we're trying to do [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=764.0s)]
*  that. And then when they pivot away from it, we're not upset [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=766.0s)]
*  because they're not going, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=768.0s)]
*  it is important for us to promote comedy [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=770.0s)]
*  at an R-rated level and dirty words [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=772.0s)]
*  are good and all these other virtuous things. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=774.0s)]
*  I get it, but it would really undercut whatever thing they're putting out [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=776.0s)]
*  if they're like, oh, we're doing this, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=778.0s)]
*  we're telling you in advance, we're only doing this because it's [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=780.0s)]
*  working. You're right, they have to give us a little bit of a [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=782.0s)]
*  lie. I also don't think that these studios are [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=784.0s)]
*  like ideologically [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=786.0s)]
*  consolidated. Well, there's one ideology. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=788.0s)]
*  I think that they, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=790.0s)]
*  I think they're bringing in different people. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=792.0s)]
*  So you'll have the executives [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=794.0s)]
*  and the finance people and the number of people [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=796.0s)]
*  that are obviously, okay, we want to make money, make sure it's profitable. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=798.0s)]
*  But then they're like, okay, let's bring in some creatives [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=800.0s)]
*  that are living in a car [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=802.0s)]
*  that are just making these beautiful movies, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=804.0s)]
*  and they probably don't give a shit. And then [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=806.0s)]
*  they're amalgamating this group of people at all [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=808.0s)]
*  of different strengths. So I think that [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=810.0s)]
*  obviously stratifying it, you have people [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=812.0s)]
*  that just care about the money, but then you have people that are like, no, I [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=814.0s)]
*  care about only the mission [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=816.0s)]
*  and then they butt heads and then hopefully they make a good product. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=818.0s)]
*  Or you start like [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=820.0s)]
*  finding people that can execute [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=822.0s)]
*  the types of stories that you [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=824.0s)]
*  think are profitable. That's what [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=826.0s)]
*  they do. Right. But you're [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=828.0s)]
*  specifically choosing them. Yeah, exactly. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=830.0s)]
*  But then those people are authentic about the way [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=832.0s)]
*  that they're. Exactly. They're not [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=834.0s)]
*  I guess lying when they're out there [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=836.0s)]
*  being like, no, we need to make this story because [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=838.0s)]
*  this is important to me in my life. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=840.0s)]
*  They were just picked because that [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=842.0s)]
*  is what their mission is. Right. And then [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=844.0s)]
*  the studio brings them in and says, OK, let's make a film. Yeah. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=846.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's just an interesting [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=848.0s)]
*  way that once a trend starts, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=850.0s)]
*  you see everything [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=852.0s)]
*  that's created through that lens. We talked about [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=854.0s)]
*  it a lot even with the Disney shit back in the day. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=856.0s)]
*  None of us thought about diversity. And Disney [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=858.0s)]
*  was wildly diverse back in the day. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=860.0s)]
*  Like Aladdin, the first thing that we're [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=862.0s)]
*  watching is there's no white people. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=864.0s)]
*  And none of us were like, where are the white people? I thought [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=866.0s)]
*  they were white. Yeah. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=868.0s)]
*  Someone had to tell, Akash [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=870.0s)]
*  was like, I really related to Aladdin because it was the first brown person. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=872.0s)]
*  I was like, who's brown in Aladdin? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=874.0s)]
*  I was like, Aladdin was like me, wasn't it? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=878.0s)]
*  The genie? Like I had no clue who was [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=880.0s)]
*  brown in that movie. Yeah. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=882.0s)]
*  Mulan didn't feel like, I know it was [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=884.0s)]
*  Asian, but it didn't feel like, oh, we need [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=886.0s)]
*  to give you an Asian story so that the [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=888.0s)]
*  Chinese market will buy it. Yeah, of course. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=890.0s)]
*  Kids are also sold to wear. I watch anime. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=892.0s)]
*  Are the characters white? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=894.0s)]
*  Or is that what Asians think they look like? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=896.0s)]
*  The eyes are too big. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=898.0s)]
*  Can we pull it up? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=900.0s)]
*  Which one is it? You're making a good point [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=902.0s)]
*  because the eyes are cartoonishly [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=904.0s)]
*  big, which is not what they're [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=906.0s)]
*  known for. And so why would all [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=908.0s)]
*  the characters not represent [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=910.0s)]
*  them? Look at those eyes. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=912.0s)]
*  It feels like they're making fun of white people. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=914.0s)]
*  Doesn't it? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=916.0s)]
*  Yeah, these round eyed motherfuckers. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=918.0s)]
*  And maybe they think we have super powers [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=920.0s)]
*  because of the nukes or something. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=922.0s)]
*  That's possible. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=924.0s)]

*  of their fucking characters in animes [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=928.0s)]
*  are fucking white. Well, there is that colorism [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=930.0s)]
*  shit, right? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=932.0s)]

*  But was Ryu white? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=952.0s)]
*  In my head, yes, but I think [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=954.0s)]
*  his origin story was he was half white, half [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=956.0s)]
*  white. And this was Ryu. The main one. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=958.0s)]

*  Oh, so you were playing... [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=978.0s)]
*  Street Fighter was like the OG game. Mortal Kombat [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=980.0s)]
*  introduced blood. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=982.0s)]
*  And blood was so badass. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=984.0s)]
*  That was like the rebellious thing. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=986.0s)]
*  But that's not the code. Yeah. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=988.0s)]

*  The NHL video game. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=992.0s)]
*  You could [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=994.0s)]
*  make their head bleed. Oh, really? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=996.0s)]
*  If you drop mitts, you could fight? Yeah, you fought [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=998.0s)]
*  and then you could make some... There was that scene in Swingers [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1000.0s)]
*  like, make him bleed, make his head bleed. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1002.0s)]
*  What's wrong with us? Even as kids, we're like [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1004.0s)]

*  Do you remember NFL Blitz? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1010.0s)]

*  It was like CTE simulator. Oh, didn't they do the X-Ray thing? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1014.0s)]
*  Yeah, if you got hit, it would slow down [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1016.0s)]
*  and show an X-Ray and the leg would fucking snap. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1018.0s)]

*  rail grind and then snap his leg bone sticks out. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1036.0s)]

*  No, they were wonderful. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1590.0s)]
*  It was technically in Alpharetta, which is not Atlanta, apparently. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1592.0s)]
*  I told many people Atlanta and it was just I lied. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1594.0s)]
*  I mean, it's close. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1596.0s)]
*  How big is Atlanta? [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1598.0s)]
*  Extremely. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1600.0s)]
*  You could go a little outside of Atlanta and it's a way different town. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1602.0s)]
*  No. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1604.0s)]
*  I'm just saying like it's you would say that you're in greater Atlanta. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1606.0s)]
*  No, of course. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1608.0s)]

*  Do we have a quota? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1618.0s)]
*  It's freezing. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1620.0s)]
*  Miles has a full hoodie on. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1622.0s)]
*  Imagine what we're feeling like. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1624.0s)]
*  We're getting blasted by the AC. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1626.0s)]
*  He does it sometimes. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1628.0s)]
*  We went to a nice dinner, had steaks, he just had a hoodie on the whole time. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1630.0s)]
*  My head hurts and for some reason wearing a hood makes it feel better. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1632.0s)]
*  I'm like, what is this? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1634.0s)]
*  You got that vaccine for me. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1636.0s)]

*  Shifty. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1640.0s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1642.0s)]
*  Let's look at what a six in Poland looks like. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1644.0s)]
*  In Poland, solid six. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1646.0s)]
*  But in America, solid ten. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1650.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1652.0s)]
*  Do you think other people would agree? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1654.0s)]
*  I hope. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1656.0s)]
*  I mean, pause. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1658.0s)]
*  If that's a six in Poland, they're doing everything right with the immigration policies. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1660.0s)]
*  You don't want to water that down. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1664.0s)]
*  You've got a really good thing going and you don't want to water that down. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1666.0s)]
*  What is that? What I just said? [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1672.0s)]
*  It's on the line. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1674.0s)]
*  It sounds a little xenophobic. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1676.0s)]
*  It sounds a little bit. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1678.0s)]
*  Can you be xenophobic for the sake of the attractiveness of your people? [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1680.0s)]
*  Because you can't guarantee every immigrant coming in is going to be a ten out of ten. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1682.0s)]
*  Unless you vet them. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1684.0s)]
*  If you vet them based on looks, then you go, okay, this is great. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1686.0s)]
*  So there's an app where everyone can just vet and if you're above a six in Poland, you can't do that. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1688.0s)]
*  So there's an app where everyone can just vet and if you're above a six in Poland, you can't do that. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1690.0s)]
*  There's an app where everyone can just vet and if you're above a seven, too, then you get to come in. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1692.0s)]
*  There's an app where everyone can just vet and if you're above a seven, too, then you get to come in. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1694.0s)]
*  But if you mix that with a little melanin. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1696.0s)]
*  If it's the right melanin. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1698.0s)]
*  If it's the right melanin. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1700.0s)]
*  You got a bunch of seals coming in. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1702.0s)]
*  No disrespect to obviously seal incredibly talented singer. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1704.0s)]

*  You need one hit. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1722.0s)]
*  He look like he got kissed by the thorns. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1724.0s)]
*  I can't be the first person to say that. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1730.0s)]
*  I cannot be the first person. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1732.0s)]
*  He kissed the stem of that Rose a few times. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1734.0s)]
*  Before he put out some petals. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1736.0s)]
*  So he was there with his daughter's 21st birthday. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1742.0s)]

*  I think that you're making a really gross allegation right now. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1752.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1757.28s)]
*  Nah, Seal, you need 18 years back of that money. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=1767.84s)]

*  There's a lot of fumes. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2074.48s)]
*  Yes, a lot of fumes. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2075.36s)]
*  Jet fuel, we're basically working with that. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2076.16s)]
*  Now, this is the other angle, which I think [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2079.44s)]
*  shows how quick we put the tire back on. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2081.36s)]
*  And how stupid I look at celebrating. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2083.7599999999998s)]
*  Yes, what? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2086.8799999999997s)]
*  I don't know what I did. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2088.0s)]
*  I wish I could justify what I did. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2089.3599999999997s)]
*  I think I was looking for people to like high five [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2091.04s)]
*  and everybody was like, this is pretty normal. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2093.68s)]
*  So I was just like, okay, I'll just keep on doing karate. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2095.7599999999998s)]
*  You never leave more Italian. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2099.7599999999998s)]
*  It's the most Italian thing. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2100.7999999999997s)]
*  Like you celebrated like you won. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2101.9199999999996s)]
*  I beat the other guy. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2104.56s)]
*  I beat the other guy who's a professional. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2105.68s)]
*  The other cars are faster. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2108.72s)]
*  So basically, steak this car. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2110.0s)]
*  Next year, Audi takes over and Audi's gonna build [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2111.68s)]
*  its own engine and they hope in four years [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2113.68s)]
*  they'll be able to be at the top. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2115.92s)]
*  But right now they buy a Ferrari engine. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2117.7599999999998s)]
*  And who knows what Ferrari gives them? [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2120.4s)]
*  They probably give them some fucking fugazi shit. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2121.6s)]
*  And there's no way to check on it. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2123.7599999999998s)]
*  But there is probably a fugazi from Ferrari. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2124.88s)]
*  So of course, if you're getting an engine [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2127.44s)]
*  that they purposely, you know how we give the shitty [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2130.0s)]
*  fighter planes to like the Middle Eastern countries? [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2131.8399999999997s)]
*  That's what far is probably doing to us. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2134.0s)]
*  So all the teams, like the builds of their cars are secret? [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2136.08s)]
*  Yeah, secret. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2140.4s)]
*  But then there's like certain standards [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2141.7599999999998s)]
*  that you have to uphold and you can call [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2143.04s)]
*  the other ones out for it. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2144.96s)]
*  So there's dude, okay. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2145.92s)]
*  It's like, why don't you just copy the best cars? [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2147.44s)]
*  That's what they try to do. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2150.56s)]
*  But like the tiniest little wind resistance thing [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2151.36s)]
*  can change everything. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2153.36s)]
*  So there's a game of like milliseconds. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2154.3199999999997s)]
*  The reason why I said it was the best event [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2155.7599999999998s)]
*  that I've ever seen. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2157.44s)]
*  Obviously we had like this unparalleled access. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2158.08s)]
*  It's like ridiculous what we got to see. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2160.0s)]
*  Like it's a different experience. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2161.52s)]
*  I get it. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2162.48s)]
*  But it brings out this like juvenile part in you [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2163.7599999999998s)]
*  that when you hear the sound of the cars. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2168.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2169.92s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2171.12s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2172.0s)]
*  I never thought I had that in me to be like, vroom. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2172.88s)]
*  I was saying it. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2175.36s)]
*  There was video of me like as it go by, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2177.84s)]
*  you'd see my mouth go vroom. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2179.6s)]
*  So it brings out this like childish nature in you. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2183.6s)]
*  And you're literally looking at like a rocket ship [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2186.48s)]
*  on the ground. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2188.48s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2189.04s)]
*  Like feeling that power pass. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2189.68s)]
*  It's it is something. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2191.44s)]
*  Were you able to go to any like good turns [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2193.12s)]
*  where they would do the passing? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2195.44s)]
*  Not really. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2196.64s)]
*  I was just like the paddock area. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2197.12s)]
*  So that's the one thing I would think that they could work out [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2198.88s)]
*  better with the sport. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2202.56s)]
*  Because when you watch them drive by you, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2203.8399999999997s)]
*  it is fucking miraculous. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2205.44s)]
*  Especially when it's raining. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2206.88s)]
*  They're shooting up all this rain and there's zero visibility. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2208.16s)]
*  I was asking the driver. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2210.88s)]
*  I was like, can you see anything? [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2211.7599999999998s)]
*  He's like, no, not really. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2212.7999999999997s)]
*  And I'm like, how are you driving? [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2213.92s)]
*  He goes, we kind of have the tracks memorized. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2215.52s)]
*  So you're kind of like in like a flow state. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2218.3199999999997s)]
*  So you're reacting. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2220.7999999999997s)]
*  You can see like the lights in the car in front of you [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2222.16s)]
*  go red for braking. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2226.24s)]
*  So you know it's kind of time to break. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2227.44s)]
*  But he's like visibility is almost zero when it's raining. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2229.3599999999997s)]
*  And them setting each other up to do these passes. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2232.48s)]
*  And you know, like there's a guy who just had a kid three days [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2236.3199999999997s)]
*  ago, Max Verstappen, right? [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2239.68s)]
*  So there's a little part of you going like, oh, he's going to be [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2240.72s)]
*  a little safe today. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2242.3999999999996s)]
*  And you're like, no, he's not. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2243.6s)]
*  He's like, cut people off. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2244.72s)]
*  He's like, if you want to pass me, we're both going to crash [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2245.9199999999996s)]
*  or you're not going to pass me. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2248.56s)]
*  Wow. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2250.56s)]
*  You had a kid three days ago. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2251.12s)]
*  Do they do any like pageantry shit where like they start [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2252.56s)]
*  the engines all the same time or like a flyover? [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2254.8s)]
*  The whole thing is pageantry. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2256.5600000000004s)]
*  They had a fucking car flyover. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2257.92s)]
*  I got to do this walk where you like walk and I'm just in the [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2259.36s)]
*  walk is just every all these famous people and that kind of [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2262.96s)]
*  stuff. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2268.4s)]
*  And everybody is submitting to the excellence of the cars. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2268.7200000000003s)]
*  Nobody's doing the walk. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2272.4s)]
*  Like I'm the thing to see here. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2273.36s)]
*  Everybody's doing the walk. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2275.44s)]
*  Like, oh, wow, that's that machine that costs three hundred [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2276.48s)]
*  million dollars to make. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2279.04s)]
*  That's that thing. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2280.0s)]
*  It's just it's just pure excess. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2280.88s)]
*  It's like everything Americans should like and nothing [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2284.08s)]
*  Europeans should like. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2286.48s)]
*  Like this is popular in Europe, but it shouldn't be like [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2287.92s)]
*  Europeans should revolt. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2291.44s)]
*  They should make all this money spent on this. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2292.64s)]
*  We should put it towards health care and like feeding the [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2294.08s)]
*  homeless and giving them housing. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2296.48s)]
*  Like we're talking about three hundred to five hundred [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2298.08s)]
*  million dollars a car. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2301.2s)]
*  Yeah, it should be just Russian shit and American shit. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2302.4s)]
*  We're the only ones that actually care about. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2306.64s)]
*  And for whatever reason, it doesn't like we have NASCAR, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2308.56s)]
*  but NASCAR feels more working class. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2311.12s)]
*  They're driving like police cars because they'll look fancy. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2313.04s)]
*  You have fake headlights on. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2316.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2317.2799999999997s)]
*  It's like, do they really? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2317.6s)]
*  Yeah, because they're not driving at night. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2319.36s)]
*  So why do you need headlights? [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2321.12s)]
*  You got painted on headlights. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2322.4s)]
*  It's all one car body in NASCAR. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2323.92s)]
*  That's so funny. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2325.92s)]
*  They all have the same car bodies, just stickers. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2326.48s)]
*  Yeah, they look different stock car. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2328.16s)]
*  I mean, it was just I'm no bullshit. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2331.44s)]
*  And I am a prisoner of the moment. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2334.4s)]
*  I admit it. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2335.6s)]
*  It was the coolest thing that I've ever fucking seen live [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2336.96s)]
*  as a sport. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2340.0s)]
*  I still don't know if the drivers do anything. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2340.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2343.44s)]
*  Like there's a little part of me that's like, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2344.72s)]
*  if you put me in the best car, I could probably beat the worst car. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2346.16s)]
*  Me. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2349.44s)]
*  You don't think that? [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2351.2s)]
*  I think the drivers have like psycho. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2353.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, because you have to be willing to go at those speeds. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2355.52s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2360.0s)]
*  And you're not going to do that. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2361.04s)]
*  You get to 80 and be like, oh. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2362.48s)]
*  Show me your wife drives you, bro. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2366.96s)]
*  Oh, you think you're going to do that? [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2369.04s)]
*  He got an F3 car and then got claustrophobia. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2372.72s)]
*  I did. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2375.6s)]
*  I couldn't breathe. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2375.92s)]
*  But that's when we were having a lot of trouble getting pregnant. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2376.48s)]
*  But I had to get out. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2381.2799999999997s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2382.4s)]
*  It wasn't an F3. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2382.8s)]
*  What was it? [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2384.0s)]
*  It was like an F4. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2384.48s)]
*  So before we went on the race, there was a, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2386.32s)]
*  that's so funny because, you know, this is these are big corporations. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2388.32s)]
*  Everybody's a little bit like careful with their words. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2391.36s)]
*  You know, so before the main race start, there was like a woman's F1. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2394.08s)]
*  It's called like F1 special or some shit. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2399.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2401.84s)]
*  But they're trying to like get women into driving, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2402.1600000000003s)]
*  which is crazy because it's not like they have to lift anything. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2404.6400000000003s)]
*  Like the car does all the driving. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2406.96s)]
*  So you think that they could do it. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2408.32s)]
*  Is it like G-forces? [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2410.6400000000003s)]
*  Like, what is the justification? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2411.76s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2412.96s)]
*  As far as I'm concerned, the G doesn't exist. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2413.76s)]
*  So I asked him and I was like, I go, you know, I'm just trying to like make stupid fucking jokes. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2417.6000000000004s)]
*  And I'm just like, so, you know, I'm sure the women, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2423.1200000000003s)]
*  there's a lot more crashes in the women's circuit. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2425.92s)]
*  Like, I'm just joking. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2427.92s)]
*  And the guy goes, well, there would probably be some good Google searches about that. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2429.2s)]
*  If you'd like to see. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2437.2s)]
*  And I go, what do you mean by that? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2438.64s)]
*  And off camera, he's basically like, yeah, they're fucking crashing all the time. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2440.0s)]
*  We can't put them in the formula cars because it costs too much to fix for the amount of the crash. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2444.64s)]
*  Wow. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2448.0s)]
*  That's so funny. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2448.56s)]
*  Is it during the race or just parking? [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2451.6s)]
*  But it was sexy. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2457.6s)]
*  You didn't like it, Al. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2458.4s)]
*  It was cool. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2460.16s)]
*  It's not bad. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2461.04s)]
*  It's just not the best live sporting event. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2462.24s)]
*  I would say like. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2464.88s)]
*  Going to a Knicks game during playoffs is 10 times better. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2465.7599999999998s)]
*  The energy that you feel, obviously, during a Knicks game is really cool. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2469.2799999999997s)]
*  I will say that that Knicks game exists for like three hours. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2472.56s)]
*  And this is like three days. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2475.04s)]
*  And then just all the different things that you are seeing [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2478.0s)]
*  and the amount of people that just kind of like submit themselves to the awe of the experience. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2481.04s)]
*  Yeah, the spectacle. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2484.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2486.56s)]
*  And again, it's like nobody is too cool for a fast car. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2487.04s)]
*  It just kind of levels the playing fields. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2491.52s)]
*  Like fucking Timothee Chalamet is there gawking at a car. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2493.2799999999997s)]
*  The same car that Kirk Douglas is gawking at. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2496.48s)]
*  All these NFL players are there just like, you just can't believe it. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2498.88s)]
*  I mean, it must be the most expensive sport. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2502.32s)]
*  Has to be. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2504.0s)]
*  There's nothing even remotely close. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2505.04s)]
*  It's like SpaceX. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2506.24s)]
*  It's like if SpaceX was for fun. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2506.96s)]
*  Every one of these is a rocket ship. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2510.32s)]
*  And every single race, something's going to break in there. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2512.4s)]
*  You have to rebuild it. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2514.72s)]
*  And it's also something about it, like you can't just try it. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2516.2400000000002s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2519.52s)]
*  Like basketball, you watch a game and then go try basketball. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2519.92s)]
*  And virtually every sport has that. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2522.7200000000003s)]
*  Whereas F1, you'll just never. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2524.16s)]
*  Barrier to entry is insanity. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2525.84s)]
*  We were doing go-karting and we were like, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2528.0s)]
*  that's as far as we're willing to go. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2531.36s)]
*  I'm not going faster than that. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2533.28s)]
*  Even like in Abu Dhabi, we had the access to do F4. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2534.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2538.2400000000002s)]
*  So even if you wanted to, you couldn't do F1. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2539.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2541.84s)]
*  So I think that there's also like for famous people specifically, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2542.32s)]
*  there's like an exclusionary aspect. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2544.88s)]
*  100%. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2546.32s)]
*  Where they're like, yeah, you just have to watch the most expensive thing, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2546.96s)]
*  money that I don't have to do a crazy sport that I'll never try. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2549.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2552.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2552.6400000000003s)]
*  It's like, I don't know, it's impossible. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2553.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's just fucking, it was just really cool. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2555.44s)]
*  I want to go to another one. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2557.84s)]
*  Who was the coolest person you talked to? [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2558.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2560.8s)]
*  I'm trying to think. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2562.32s)]
*  Any interesting people you're like, oh shit, this person's here? [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2562.96s)]
*  To me, like the most interesting were like the engineers and the people working on the cars. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2565.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2569.2000000000003s)]
*  The little things that can make such massive differences, how piecemeal the cars are. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2569.6s)]
*  Everything can be removed and a new thing put on within seconds. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2574.64s)]
*  So your firm wing gets fucked up, there's another firm wing. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2577.8399999999997s)]
*  So you have a spaceship that can be completely rebuilt in a matter of seconds. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2581.4399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it's just the monocoque. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2586.0s)]
*  That's really like the middle part stays the same. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2587.2799999999997s)]
*  You could have the engine and gearbox break down and within an hour, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2590.0s)]
*  they have a new engine and gearbox put into a car, everything rewired and you're racing. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2593.52s)]
*  Wow. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2600.3199999999997s)]
*  So you fuck it up in the trials or whatever it is. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2600.72s)]
*  It's just like- [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2604.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's fascinating. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2604.72s)]
*  That's dope. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2605.84s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2606.32s)]
*  And who are these guys? [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2607.36s)]
*  Are they like quants kind of like socially awkward genius types? [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2608.08s)]
*  Some of them are maybe and then some of them seem like they were just kind of [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2611.84s)]
*  like the guys who do like the union shit at the theaters we go. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2617.04s)]
*  You know, it's just like a dude who like- [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2622.24s)]
*  Roadie. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2624.16s)]
*  Yeah, like roadies like for musicians, like that same kind of vibe. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2624.8s)]
*  Like I just love cars, like mechanics. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2627.6s)]
*  Like what would be the coolest job if you were a mechanic? [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2629.92s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2632.24s)]
*  It's like I could fix cars in New York at a shop or I could work on a fucking [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2633.76s)]
*  Formula One team and travel the world. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2636.8s)]
*  Are any of them like former athletes? [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2638.56s)]
*  That's what I heard and I looked at them and it didn't seem that way. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2640.16s)]
*  But I heard all of them were like Formula D1 guys where it was like not at all. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2643.04s)]
*  They're all kind of small. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2646.4s)]
*  All the drivers are really skinny. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2647.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2649.04s)]
*  Like really skinny, really lean. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2649.6s)]
*  Some of them are tiny. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2651.68s)]
*  Some of them may be my height, but like lean every single one. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2652.56s)]
*  Oh, that's interesting. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2656.16s)]
*  Apparently with NASCAR it's that way. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2656.8s)]
*  It's like all like D2 football players, the guy that got drafted and then came out [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2657.92s)]
*  and now he's just like pit guy moving gasoline around. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2661.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2665.44s)]
*  Which like it's kind of sick if you're a former pro athlete to go fuck around some cars. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2665.76s)]
*  And same kind of, I wonder if lifestyle is more similar. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2669.76s)]
*  It's like you're traveling every single weekend, super high stakes. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2672.7200000000003s)]
*  You're part of this crew. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2675.52s)]
*  How much do you think I pay do you think? [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2677.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2678.48s)]
*  I'm trying to, I like, I was trying to crunch numbers on everything. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2679.04s)]
*  Like who gets paid the most? [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2681.92s)]
*  Driver. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2683.36s)]
*  No, I think it's the principal, like the person who is like the head of the team [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2684.08s)]
*  who has to like hire all the different positions. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2689.04s)]
*  I actually don't know if the drivers are that respected. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2691.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2695.44s)]
*  That's what I'm curious about. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2695.6s)]
*  Are they like a jockey? [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2696.48s)]
*  That, yeah, that might be like a harsh thing to say, but like, I think that the leaders [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2697.44s)]
*  of the teams and like the top engineers are the more coveted people than the drivers. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2701.28s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2707.6s)]
*  Because like you could take the worst driver and put them in the best car [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2708.32s)]
*  and they would be competitive. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2711.76s)]
*  That's what I want. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2713.84s)]
*  Like horse racing, you know the horse's name. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2714.32s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2716.88s)]
*  Like, you don't know the jockey, but you know Seabiscuit. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2717.76s)]
*  I didn't know one of the guys that was driving a car for our team. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2721.2s)]
*  I didn't know. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2726.0s)]
*  I met him and I didn't know if he was like a guy that does the pit stop [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2727.52s)]
*  or if he was driving a car. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2731.9199999999996s)]
*  I didn't want to be disrespectful, but I didn't know. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2734.0s)]
*  Do you know him now? [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2736.48s)]
*  No. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2737.3599999999997s)]
*  He didn't finish the race. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2739.04s)]
*  I was like, you got to finish for me to take a pit. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2740.08s)]
*  What happened? [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2744.64s)]
*  The tire you changed flew off. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2745.12s)]
*  That's crazy amount of access that you get. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2746.16s)]
*  Like I'm surprised like before they just let everybody walk. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2750.56s)]
*  Not everybody, but they let people walk on the grid where all the cars are set up. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2756.64s)]
*  And it's like you could sabotage another car. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2759.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2763.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't know how you would do it, but you could walk up, look at it, unscrew some shit. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2765.04s)]
*  Throw some acid on someone's face. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2768.96s)]
*  I saw a seal there. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2773.92s)]
*  Actually, that's why I brought him up. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2774.72s)]
*  Handsome, great guy. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2776.7999999999997s)]
*  Sweet. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2777.8399999999997s)]
*  I can't believe I said that joke about the thorns. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2780.56s)]
*  That was so rude. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2782.72s)]
*  I think Al sets a really disgusting tone. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2784.3199999999997s)]
*  Definitely didn't. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2787.44s)]
*  He's like a bully. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2788.3199999999997s)]
*  I was like a bully. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2788.96s)]
*  He brings out a very mean energy. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2789.6s)]
*  Yeah, you really do. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2790.96s)]
*  I was right to call out that his daughter looks very different from him. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2792.48s)]
*  Oh, because he's white. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2795.8399999999997s)]
*  Anyway, it was great. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2802.16s)]
*  Shout out to Carbone. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2803.2s)]
*  Carbone hooked us up. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2804.3999999999996s)]
*  Reunited with my boy, my twin, Ryan Clark and Jelly. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2805.92s)]
*  Also, Jelly is fucking incredible. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2810.1600000000003s)]
*  I actually got to see him do a full show. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2812.32s)]
*  He's incredible. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2814.8s)]
*  He's incredible. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2817.2000000000003s)]
*  And I mean that in that he understands. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2818.56s)]
*  You could tell he's done decades of shitty shows. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2822.08s)]
*  This is the difference maker. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2826.88s)]
*  The people who've done decades of shitty shows [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2828.4s)]
*  know how to really galvanize and rattle up a crowd and play a crowd like an instrument. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2830.64s)]
*  And the people who are pop star and then they have their hit, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2836.3199999999997s)]
*  without their hit, they don't really have anything. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2840.08s)]
*  They're learning how to live perform after they're famous. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2842.3199999999997s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2844.72s)]
*  You could tell he's done the toughest, hardest fucking shows. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2845.44s)]
*  I was curious. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2850.56s)]
*  I was like, what's he going to do? [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2851.2s)]
*  We're in this Carbone Beach dinner. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2852.4s)]
*  There's all these fancy people there. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2856.3199999999997s)]
*  They might not even know country music that much. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2858.24s)]
*  Maybe they don't know some of his hits. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2861.12s)]
*  I'm like, how is he going to handle this? [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2862.48s)]
*  And within 30 seconds of bringing it up, he's kind of doing call and response, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2864.0s)]
*  almost crowd work-esque stuff, really getting people excited. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2870.3999999999996s)]
*  Banger of a song that maybe people know but didn't, [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2874.56s)]
*  but it had so much excitement that they're getting riled up. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2877.52s)]
*  You could even tell that he was a bit concerned. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2880.56s)]
*  Because he mentioned that a couple times. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2882.56s)]
*  He's like, yo, I'm going to turn this shit into a honky tonk. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2883.8399999999997s)]
*  I didn't realize all you guys like country music the way he does. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2886.56s)]
*  Here, play. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2889.68s)]
*  Oh, hell yeah. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2898.24s)]
*  Look how much... [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2906.24s)]
*  Pause right there. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2908.16s)]
*  Go back a little second. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2909.68s)]
*  Why were you hesitant to put your whole hand on him? [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2910.72s)]
*  It seemed like you were doing that. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2914.72s)]
*  That's yours. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2916.7999999999997s)]
*  What is wrong with you? [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2919.04s)]
*  Is that not clear to you? [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2920.24s)]
*  It felt like you wanted to. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2923.36s)]
*  It felt like you wanted to embrace him, but you were a little insecure. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2925.6s)]
*  Years of trauma. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2929.12s)]
*  He was holding onto the camera. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2930.32s)]
*  I'm a little strong if I grab him. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2932.24s)]
*  He's delicate. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2934.7999999999997s)]
*  No, you wanted to cross that arm over his chest and just hold him. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2935.6s)]
*  But look at your hand. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2940.4s)]
*  Look how uncomfortable that hand is. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2941.44s)]
*  It looks like not your hand. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2944.32s)]
*  Tell us what's going through that moment because you obviously want to be part of this singing. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2946.88s)]
*  Were you not drunk enough to just be yourself? [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2952.0s)]
*  I didn't know the words. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2953.84s)]
*  I did not know the words. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2957.52s)]
*  If you really look close to me, I'm doing one of those things where you just like... [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2958.64s)]
*  And how early in his set did he play this? [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2965.68s)]
*  Now this is maybe like midway. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2968.08s)]
*  But no, he just did... [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2971.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, he did rap songs. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2972.56s)]
*  He did honky tonky. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2974.0s)]
*  He did old school classic. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2975.12s)]
*  He covers like it was truly amazing. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2976.32s)]
*  And the next day he went to go perform in a stadium in Las Vegas with Post Malone. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2979.6000000000004s)]
*  And then the next day he came back to run a 5k in Miami. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2983.44s)]
*  That was crazy. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2987.04s)]
*  Oh, he was running in Tampa, right? [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2987.6000000000004s)]
*  Some player for harder. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2990.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2991.28s)]
*  He's moving. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2992.56s)]
*  He's moving different. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2993.04s)]
*  He's moving different. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2994.0s)]
*  Shout out to Jelly. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2994.8s)]
*  Lost some weight. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2995.6000000000004s)]
*  Looking great. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=2999.92s)]

*  I got to meet the most talented human being on the planet. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3015.84s)]
*  Dressed like Street Fighter, man. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3018.24s)]
*  That shit was fire. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3019.36s)]
*  He's raiding, man. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3022.08s)]
*  He's raiding, man. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3022.88s)]
*  He's got mortal confidence. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3023.44s)]
*  He's got mortal confidence. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3024.48s)]
*  Yeah, Jamie's the fucking man. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3025.44s)]
*  Anyway, it was cool as hell. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3026.64s)]
*  Definitely cool. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3028.24s)]
*  I suggest if you guys have the opportunity, go check out a Formula One. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3028.88s)]
*  And root for Team Stake. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3032.24s)]
*  And guys, if you're going to bet on Formula One or the NBA playoffs, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3033.68s)]
*  obviously the Knicks, you already know what time it is. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3036.3999999999996s)]
*  We already knew that was going to happen. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3038.72s)]
*  We let Boston feel like they were going to have a chance. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3040.0s)]
*  But if you're going to bet on Formula One or the NBA playoffs, [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3041.8399999999997s)]
*  Stake is the leader in global betting in US social casinos, [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3045.2s)]
*  bet on top sports, political events, and use the promo code FLAGRANT [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3047.7599999999998s)]
*  for your welcome bonus. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3050.64s)]
*  Now let's get back to the show. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3051.6s)]
*  Do y'all care about the Met Gala? [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3052.7999999999997s)]
*  Sort of in a weird way. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3056.72s)]
*  You see like a crazy outfit. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3057.44s)]
*  You're like, oh, that's kind of interesting. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3058.48s)]
*  I still barely understand what it is. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3059.9199999999996s)]
*  Me neither. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3061.8399999999997s)]
*  I barely get what's going on. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3063.28s)]
*  What happens inside? [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3065.04s)]
*  It's a dinner, right? [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3065.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3066.64s)]
*  I feel like it's just like Carbone Beach. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3067.04s)]
*  Sit down, dinner, then everybody gets up, somebody performs. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3069.52s)]
*  But it's a fundraiser. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3072.32s)]
*  It's probably the same shit. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3072.8s)]
*  It's a fundraiser. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3073.76s)]
*  I think it's one of those fundraisers. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3074.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3076.56s)]
*  But like that's the thing that I don't get. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3076.8s)]
*  So like does it start as a gala? [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3078.2400000000002s)]
*  A lot of these high society events, they make fundraisers as an excuse [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3079.92s)]
*  for like rich and fancy people to celebrate themselves. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3084.56s)]
*  So I think it's more about celebrating yourself. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3089.2s)]
*  And then you realize, oh shit, if we keep celebrating ourselves, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3092.08s)]
*  poor people are going to fucking shoot us in the back of the head. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3094.4s)]
*  All right, so let's make it a fundraiser for a cause. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3096.88s)]
*  But I think that's after the fact. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3099.44s)]
*  I don't think that's. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3101.04s)]
*  And then the clothing brand picks a celebrity. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3102.0s)]
*  I think they make the outfit for them. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3104.7999999999997s)]
*  And I think they donate on their behalf. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3106.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3108.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3108.3199999999997s)]
*  Celebrity just gets to go and get to go. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3108.56s)]
*  But it's more about like a qualification. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3110.64s)]
*  Like if you're invited to this event, then you must be like one of the most famous people, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3112.24s)]
*  whatever it is. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3116.72s)]
*  So I think it's like very exciting in that regard. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3117.52s)]
*  And then I get why people go. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3119.6s)]
*  I get why brands do it. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3121.12s)]
*  That part all makes sense. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3122.72s)]
*  I'm so curious about the fascination. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3123.7599999999998s)]
*  Like the amount that it grips people. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3126.88s)]
*  People love fashion. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3128.3199999999997s)]
*  They love famous people. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3129.52s)]
*  Is it fashion? [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3130.56s)]
*  And they love. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3131.2s)]
*  Fashion, famous people. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3132.0s)]
*  And judgment. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3133.52s)]
*  Exclusivity. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3134.08s)]
*  But you also get to judge. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3135.8399999999997s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3137.04s)]
*  You get to be like one of those chef shows. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3137.8399999999997s)]
*  You get to say if the food is good or not. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3141.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3142.88s)]
*  So I think it puts us, all of us that are not invited, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3143.2s)]
*  that are not the famous people, that are not part of the inside circle. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3146.08s)]
*  Not only do we get to judge them, we get to make fun of them [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3150.08s)]
*  because a lot of them address like really foolishly. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3152.3199999999997s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3154.24s)]
*  So in a lot of ways like it's, and I'm guilty of this, [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3155.04s)]
*  like it's easy for us to just sit back. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3158.64s)]
*  Oh, look at these stupid people. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3160.0s)]
*  But it's like that's kind of the event's purpose in my opinion. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3161.36s)]
*  They're submitting themselves for judgment. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3165.44s)]
*  And there are these designers that are trying to do like the most provocative, [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3167.52s)]
*  ridiculous things. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3170.48s)]
*  And on some level, I like that. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3172.16s)]
*  Like I like, I love it. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3174.88s)]
*  I like it when people try. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3176.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3177.6s)]
*  Like, what's his face bringing the piano on his back is fucking retarded. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3178.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3181.92s)]
*  But I like that there's an attempt made to do something. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3182.48s)]
*  He's also not doing it, right? [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3185.36s)]
*  Like it's the designer being like, this is what you're going to wear. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3186.56s)]
*  I think you could say no. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3188.88s)]
*  You have an idea of what. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3190.16s)]
*  How does it work? [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3192.08s)]
*  Like, do the designers be like, this is what we're thinking? [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3192.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3194.64s)]
*  And then they collaborate with it. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3195.28s)]
*  They collaborate with it. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3196.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3197.04s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3197.44s)]
*  And I like this. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3198.8s)]
*  He got music on his back. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3199.84s)]
*  Like that shit, just the messaging for that. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3201.28s)]
*  I think it's dope. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3203.84s)]
*  I'm surprised how easy he's walking around. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3204.72s)]
*  I mean, do you think it's an actual piano? [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3209.9199999999996s)]
*  No, I know it's not. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3211.4399999999996s)]
*  Of course it's not. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3215.2799999999997s)]
*  But he's moving very easily around. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3216.0s)]
*  Like that shit's still as wide as he's not bumping nobody. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3218.3199999999997s)]
*  He's not knocking motherfuckers. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3221.9199999999996s)]
*  Al thought it was real. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3222.9599999999996s)]
*  He definitely unstrapped it and started playing. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3226.24s)]
*  I feel like he definitely did that. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3228.24s)]
*  You're so bad at it, though. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3232.7999999999997s)]
*  I thought that was a real piano. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3233.92s)]
*  I was watching this on HBO last night. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3235.76s)]
*  You gotta take that. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3238.4s)]
*  Come on. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3238.96s)]
*  He's walking around with a grand piano. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3240.7200000000003s)]
*  How can he hold such way walking up those stairs? [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3244.4s)]
*  I hope there's a video that comes out of him playing that shit. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3247.6s)]
*  It might be playable, but it's not a full-size piano. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3252.16s)]
*  No, if it's playable, then I won. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3254.88s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3256.32s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3256.88s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3257.2000000000003s)]
*  The point is that it's heavy. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3257.84s)]
*  You're concerned because it's heavy and it's wide. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3260.0s)]
*  It's uncomfortable. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3263.04s)]
*  He's moving around. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3263.84s)]
*  You see people walking around with a bunch of balloons, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3264.64s)]
*  so you're like, how are they doing that? [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3266.72s)]
*  They're not flying away. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3268.48s)]
*  They're staying on the ground. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3269.6s)]
*  That must take so much strength. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3270.72s)]
*  I wish I could be in your head for a day and just see the world. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3275.68s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3278.48s)]
*  You wouldn't see much. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3279.2799999999997s)]
*  You would love it. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3281.2799999999997s)]
*  You would just be staring down at your face. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3282.4s)]
*  How am I holding this thing up? [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3285.6s)]
*  This is such a big penis. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3287.7599999999998s)]
*  How did you know Seal's daughter wasn't real, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3290.56s)]
*  but the piano was? [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3292.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3293.44s)]
*  The piano was. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3293.94s)]
*  That broken clock is right two times a day. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3294.48s)]
*  Oh, Mr. Milchick. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3297.44s)]
*  Who is this? [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3300.4s)]
*  The guy from Severance. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3301.36s)]
*  Oh. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3302.88s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3304.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3305.2000000000003s)]
*  Got swag. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3305.7000000000003s)]
*  Listen. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3306.32s)]
*  Viva Lisa from White Lotus. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3307.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3309.36s)]
*  This girl is unstoppable. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3310.64s)]
*  Have you heard the whole controversy with this outfit? [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3312.32s)]
*  Tell me right now. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3314.32s)]
*  So Rosa Parks is in her vagina. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3315.6s)]
*  I saw a bunch of people on Twitter getting pissed off. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3317.92s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3323.36s)]
*  So again, the theme is Black Dandyism. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3324.16s)]
*  So on the outfit, there's different historical Black civil rights leaders. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3326.24s)]
*  And one of them... [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3333.36s)]
*  Are we serious right now? [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3334.4s)]
*  Google it, bro. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3335.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, I'm not even fucking got, but I'm 99% sure. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3336.4s)]
*  Did you see this? [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3340.16s)]
*  No, but I do have a joke, so keep going. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3340.96s)]
*  So apparently, there's many different civil rights leaders, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3343.52s)]
*  and Rosa Parks is over her crotch right there. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3347.28s)]
*  But there's many of them. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3352.1600000000003s)]
*  Not just Rosa Parks. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3354.4s)]
*  But to my understanding, that was the one that people were mad about. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3355.76s)]
*  Why would they do her like that? [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3357.6000000000004s)]
*  To who? Rosa? [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3359.92s)]
*  No, this girl, the hot Asian chick. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3361.04s)]
*  I don't know if they're doing her like that in a negative way. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3364.0s)]
*  You know she's going to get... [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3366.1600000000003s)]
*  What's wrong with the vagina? [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3367.76s)]
*  I think vagina is the most respectable... [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3369.04s)]
*  It's the most respectable part of a woman's body. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3373.04s)]
*  No, think about it. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3377.36s)]
*  There could be no more respectable part of a woman's body than the vagina. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3379.04s)]
*  It's in many of our definitions, what makes a woman a woman. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3382.32s)]
*  Yeah, but put it like not on a sideways one. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3385.84s)]
*  No, but this is... [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3396.8s)]
*  Al, what do you think? [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3397.44s)]
*  Do you think with all due respect to Lisa, do you think the lips are dark? [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3398.96s)]
*  Because then maybe they put her in the color... [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3402.96s)]
*  Which would be the most disrespectful thing to do to Rosa Parks. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3416.32s)]
*  That's the worst thing to do. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3418.96s)]
*  You've got to put her in the white section. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3419.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's fucked up. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3421.04s)]
*  That was fucked. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3422.88s)]

*  Jesus Christ. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3439.04s)]
*  Yeah, personally, I think she ate and left no crumbs. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3440.24s)]
*  Personally, her body is... [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3446.24s)]
*  My honest opinion. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3450.7999999999997s)]

*  I thought she could have done more. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3455.3599999999997s)]
*  I hate you, Al. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3457.12s)]
*  That is the most amazing critique. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3459.9199999999996s)]
*  How is everybody's jaw so perfect now? [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3461.44s)]
*  How does everybody have this macula jawline? [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3464.32s)]
*  I also have that question. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3467.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3468.2400000000002s)]
*  Is that fillers? [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3470.64s)]
*  Is that makeup? [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3471.52s)]
*  What is giving everybody perfect jawlines? [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3472.4s)]
*  Does Zempi maybe? [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3474.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3475.44s)]
*  But even with Zempik, I don't know if it can actually restructure your jaw. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3476.08s)]
*  But I think it just depletes so much of the fat and muscle in your face. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3479.12s)]
*  It kind of like brings all the bones out. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3482.88s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3484.7200000000003s)]
*  But the rest of her doesn't look like Zempik. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3485.92s)]
*  Yeah, true. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3487.68s)]
*  It's like Halloween. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3490.08s)]
*  Here's the thing about the Mac out. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3492.2400000000002s)]
*  Once we accept that we're the ones that benefit the most, [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3493.52s)]
*  because we get to make fun of and potentially humiliate the most famous successful people on [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3496.88s)]
*  the planet, and that is by design what the show is about, whether or not they know it. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3503.2000000000003s)]
*  But it's what it is for the majority of people. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3509.36s)]
*  It's kind of great for us. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3512.0s)]
*  And they could just be like, you're just hating because you wasn't there. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3514.96s)]
*  Because you wasn't there. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3517.84s)]
*  So it kind of works out for everybody. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3518.72s)]
*  And I like the designers trying to flex. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3521.52s)]
*  Why do white people went so like, go better, go harder? [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3523.52s)]
*  This is a regular outfit. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3528.48s)]
*  Yeah, but Black Dandyism is the theme. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3529.6s)]
*  It's a little bit of a, you know, gotta be delicate. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=3532.7999999999997s)]

*  This is a serious issue and it's affecting a lot of people. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4376.799999999999s)]
*  Where is Burkina Faso? [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4379.12s)]
*  Mr. G, teach us. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4380.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4381.36s)]
*  Let's learn. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4382.96s)]
*  First of all, where is it? [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4384.0s)]
*  West Africa. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4384.96s)]
*  It's near Mali. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4385.6s)]
*  Okay. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4387.200000000001s)]
*  And for years, they were colonized by the French. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4388.08s)]
*  Okay. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4391.84s)]
*  And the French basically colonized them and started taking all the resources. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4392.56s)]
*  Yep. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4395.68s)]
*  As they do? [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4396.16s)]
*  As they do. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4397.04s)]
*  Only them? [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4397.76s)]
*  Well, they apparently have their history of colonization is different. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4399.04s)]
*  The British sometimes would come in and nanny stay, [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4403.04s)]
*  but the French would just come in and be like, we're taking everything. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4406.16s)]
*  Taking it all. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4407.84s)]
*  So then they get independence in the 60s, [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4408.8s)]
*  but the French leave, but in prop of a bunch of their backed politicians that then run the country [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4410.8s)]
*  and just kind of siphon off all the resources to the French. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4416.16s)]
*  Right. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4418.72s)]
*  Also, the US kind of comes in, starts siphoning off resources. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4419.2s)]
*  And then they leave military there that were able to just break up conflicts. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4422.4800000000005s)]
*  Even though they were free, it was like, nah, we're still going to leave some of our military. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4429.92s)]
*  They had a presence and then the president was backed by the French. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4432.56s)]
*  And then they get this guy, Sankara, back in the day, he gets assassinated. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4436.16s)]
*  He was trying to liberate the country and nationalize the resources. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4439.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4442.400000000001s)]
*  And then gets assassinated. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4442.88s)]
*  And then basically from then until 2016, they've just been under [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4443.92s)]
*  French colonization, stealing all their shit. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4449.360000000001s)]
*  And then in 2022, this dude comes in and says, nah, fuck that. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4452.8s)]
*  What's his name? [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4456.0s)]
*  Ibrahim Traori. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4457.040000000001s)]
*  Yeah, basically just takes back the country and starts nationalizing all the resources. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4461.76s)]
*  So does a coup, creates a government, and he's not a leader of it. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4464.96s)]
*  He's 37 years old. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4468.48s)]
*  Fire. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4469.679999999999s)]
*  And is just running the country. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4470.24s)]
*  Was he a military guy? [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4472.08s)]
*  Formerly military. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4474.4s)]
*  And then so how did he get the loyalty of the military? [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4475.5199999999995s)]
*  Basically, he was just like, yo, this is fucked up what they're doing. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4478.48s)]
*  All these presidents are like Manchurian candidates, siphoning off our resources, [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4481.5199999999995s)]
*  leaving our country in squalor. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4485.44s)]
*  Burkina Faso has historically the lowest GDP, or of the lowest GDPs. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4486.719999999999s)]
*  40% of the country lives below the poverty line. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4490.959999999999s)]
*  Everyone's struggling, but they have the fourth most gold of any African country. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4492.799999999999s)]
*  Just getting crushed. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4497.12s)]
*  They're like, what is happening? [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4498.5599999999995s)]
*  Why does this keep happening to us? [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4499.5199999999995s)]
*  And so then they do a military coup, and then the guy that leads military coup ends up getting [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4500.719999999999s)]
*  ousted by him. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4504.959999999999s)]
*  So it's like a coup of a coup. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4506.24s)]
*  Oh shit. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4507.679999999999s)]
*  Of another coup. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4508.48s)]
*  There's just all these different coups. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4509.5199999999995s)]
*  So he eventually gets appointed by the coup board. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4510.799999999999s)]
*  And they're basically like, yeah, Ibrahim is going to run it. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4513.599999999999s)]
*  And now everyone- [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4515.679999999999s)]
*  Why did the first guy get kicked out? [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4516.5599999999995s)]
*  Do you know? [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4517.919999999999s)]
*  They were unsure of his loyalty. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4518.48s)]
*  And then also he wasn't going hard enough on the jihadists. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4521.2s)]
*  So there's two problems happening in Burkina Faso. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4524.0s)]
*  Where the one is the French occupation. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4525.839999999999s)]
*  And then the other thing is you have jihadists coming in from Mali that are now displacing all [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4527.84s)]
*  these people in Burkina Faso. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4531.76s)]
*  So they're coming through. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4533.28s)]
*  Two million people have been displaced. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4534.16s)]
*  Thousands of people have been killed by this militant Islamist regime trying to create [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4535.2s)]
*  an Islamic state. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4540.24s)]
*  What's their name? [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4541.2s)]
*  They're connected to Al-Qaeda and ISIS. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4542.56s)]
*  They have super specific sets. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4544.08s)]
*  I don't know what the clique's specific name is. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4547.360000000001s)]
*  But basically he's coming through and being like, yo, we're nationalizing the gold. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4549.84s)]
*  We're kicking all the jihadists out. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4552.4800000000005s)]
*  And we're going to make Burkina Faso great again. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4554.400000000001s)]
*  There's been like two assassination attempts on his life. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4557.28s)]
*  Oh, yes, so far. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4560.08s)]
*  And they've tried to like coup him. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4562.16s)]
*  So he got super popular recently in April because they tried to do a coup on him. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4563.36s)]
*  He was like, nah, fuck that. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4566.48s)]
*  And so now what happens internally is that you have people within your own regime trying [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4568.08s)]
*  to take you out. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4573.2s)]
*  So there's other people vying for power. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4574.48s)]
*  People that helped you get to your position now trying to take you out. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4576.24s)]
*  So now he's creating a system. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4579.12s)]
*  I don't even understand how they're doing it. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4580.5599999999995s)]
*  There's not even a ton of coverage on this. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4581.679999999999s)]
*  It's hard to find. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4582.88s)]
*  And he's basically like quelling internal coups and basically appointed himself as like [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4584.16s)]
*  the leader of the country. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4588.5599999999995s)]
*  Holy shit. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4589.5199999999995s)]
*  Kind of did away with like the democracy hit a quote where he was like, democracy's never [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4590.16s)]
*  progressed a country. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4594.72s)]
*  No country's ever developed under democracy. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4595.5199999999995s)]
*  We need like a strong king to like rule this shit. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4597.6s)]
*  And it seems like he's doing it. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4600.72s)]
*  So the people of Burkina Faso are like pretty stoked on it. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4601.68s)]
*  And now this like authoritarian kind of thing is like spreading through Africa. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4604.08s)]
*  People are like, we need this in every former colony state because all of Africa has been [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4607.44s)]
*  now like beholden to their colonial ancestors and their parents rather. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4612.32s)]
*  I imagine in the near future, there will be no buying of the rights to your natural resources. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4618.0s)]
*  They'll only be partnering. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4626.799999999999s)]
*  Like I think recently in like Trinidad, there was this leader who sold all of the [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4630.4s)]
*  because Trinidad has oil. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4635.2s)]
*  So I think they like sold all the oil rights to the Chinese for like 100 years or like [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4636.48s)]
*  Lisa for 100 years. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4640.719999999999s)]
*  And like the way this thing happens is that they cut the deal so that that specific person [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4641.84s)]
*  gets super rich at the cost of the people. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4646.24s)]
*  And this happens, I'm sure, all over the world. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4648.32s)]
*  But I imagine like as maybe one of the benefits of globalism is that there'll be these like [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4650.08s)]
*  international policy laws in place that will protect the colonial countries from doing this. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4657.52s)]
*  But at the same time, these smaller countries do need the investment for infrastructure. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4665.28s)]
*  So if you've got all this oil and you need to find a way to get it out, but everybody's [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4669.28s)]
*  living in poverty, you need investment. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4673.36s)]
*  So it can operate in a similar way to I'm trying to think like, I mean, UAE is, in my [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4675.5199999999995s)]
*  opinion, the best example. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4680.88s)]
*  Okay, give me give me. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4681.84s)]
*  So like their British mandate, the English control the whole area. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4682.5599999999995s)]
*  And it's not even UAE, it's all the separate Emirates. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4687.36s)]
*  And then they find oil in the 50s. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4689.679999999999s)]
*  And then Sheikh Zayed brokers a deal with the British and is like, hey, we're going [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4691.679999999999s)]
*  to give you the oil. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4695.28s)]
*  At first, they started just beginning, like taking the raw oil, not refining it in the [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4696.0s)]
*  country, not helping the people just getting all the oil out of there. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4699.36s)]
*  He goes, no, no, no, we're going to come together, unite all the Emirates, and then [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4701.6s)]
*  nationalize the oil and refine it all here and then partner with BP so you guys get rights. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4705.52s)]
*  And then partner with the US Exxon, all them, you guys get rights to the oil. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4710.4s)]
*  And then that's where the petrodollar comes from. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4714.24s)]
*  So like, hey, we're all going to trade our oil, we're going to give you guys good deals, [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4716.4s)]
*  we're going to partner with you guys, and we're down to play ball, but we're going [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4719.4400000000005s)]
*  to help our people first. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4722.32s)]
*  And was diplomatic enough to make it work like he didn't get ousted or, you know, [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4723.84s)]
*  replaced. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4729.04s)]
*  I mean, there's a way where it's actually cheaper for the colonial countries to do this [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4730.0s)]
*  because they're like, hold on. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4734.4s)]
*  So you'll organize it, stop all the warring factions, because if there's war in the [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4735.679999999999s)]
*  country, we can't extract the oil. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4739.2s)]
*  If we have to worry about G.O.D. has blown some shit up or a coup happening, it stops [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4740.88s)]
*  the oil from coming. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4744.16s)]
*  So there's a certain amount of money that you have to pay for protection for your goods. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4744.96s)]
*  So it's probably cheaper to have a leader that will give you access. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4748.88s)]
*  And then that leader goes, OK, how much you pay and protect all the shit? [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4752.48s)]
*  OK, well, you don't have to pay that anymore because I'm going to protect it. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4755.36s)]
*  But I want that delta. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4758.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4760.719999999999s)]
*  Historically, the cheapest thing was let's just put our guy in who's going to give us [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4761.599999999999s)]
*  everything. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4764.639999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4765.12s)]
*  And now it looks like him a millionaire. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4765.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4767.28s)]
*  And we'll just take everything. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4767.839999999999s)]
*  But now the people are going, they're educated enough and maybe the Internet is available [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4768.799999999999s)]
*  enough where people go, OK, this isn't fair and we're getting fucked. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4772.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4774.799999999999s)]
*  And there's other examples, I guess, in Africa or even the Middle East where like there's a [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4775.12s)]
*  different system that actually benefits the people. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4778.639999999999s)]
*  But then when you have situations like this happen, then they just take them out like [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4780.5599999999995s)]
*  Gaddafi. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4783.839999999999s)]
*  That is. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4785.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4785.759999999999s)]
*  I mean, that happens all around the world. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4786.16s)]
*  But now maybe there's enough security where you don't get to do that. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4787.28s)]
*  And it's also like there's a lot of shame that goes along with that. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4790.639999999999s)]
*  Like back in the day, you could take someone out and nobody really knows about it. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4793.04s)]
*  But like, if it's making news and somebody gets killed, you have to go, well, who killed [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4795.759999999999s)]
*  him? [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4800.639999999999s)]
*  And then if it trickles back to France, imagine how we're going to look at Macron or the [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4800.879999999999s)]
*  leadership over there that's basically OKing the murder of a not only the government official, [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4806.4s)]
*  but like the leading government entity in an independent country. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4812.719999999999s)]
*  I would say yes and no, because a lot of people, it's over there and we can just it's like out [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4815.599999999999s)]
*  of sight out of mind. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4821.12s)]
*  And you kind of you just fund a sort of separate military group. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4821.679999999999s)]
*  So don't handle all that shit. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4825.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4826.639999999999s)]
*  And you fund five of them. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4827.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4828.48s)]
*  And then whichever one wins, you're like, oh, great, we got a guy back. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4828.639999999999s)]
*  But there's a cost, too, for that. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4830.879999999999s)]
*  It's like what the mafia bosses will always say. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4832.0s)]
*  It's like when we're all at war, we're not making money. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4833.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4835.599999999999s)]
*  Brings way too much attention. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4836.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that the best I really think that even for the colonial powers, it works [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4837.76s)]
*  better if you just take maybe you making 10 percent less, maybe you're making 30 percent [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4842.32s)]
*  less, but you don't have to worry about shit and you get to act like you're this like [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4845.76s)]
*  benevolent partner. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4849.52s)]
*  Like, wouldn't you rather the world see you as somebody who's like lifting up these African [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4851.36s)]
*  nations instead of this like diabolical like I don't want to say like terrorists, but like [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4855.28s)]
*  colonial state. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4860.8s)]
*  Which like they they kind of do. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4862.08s)]
*  So like some of the colonists are like, no, no, we have like aid programs and we're [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4863.76s)]
*  getting you guys aid and we're helping out. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4867.360000000001s)]
*  But even that gets caught up by the people in charge if they're corrupt. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4869.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4871.4400000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4871.76s)]
*  So then the food actually reaches the people. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4871.92s)]
*  There's that great example of I think it's Botswana, if I'm not mistaken. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4874.88s)]
*  But there's this leader who was just like, I mean, you could argue maybe looking up right [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4882.08s)]
*  now, but like one of the greatest leaders in history. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4888.24s)]
*  He basically took this African nation from squalor to like the highest like GDP of any [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4890.16s)]
*  African nation, the highest levels of education. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4896.0s)]
*  And he like slowly did it piece by piece. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4898.0s)]
*  But first was I think nobody actually had rights to their minerals. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4899.84s)]
*  I think they had like diamonds. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4902.96s)]
*  You can look at it and see if it's Botswana. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4904.0s)]
*  I'm not exactly sure. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4905.44s)]
*  I forget this guy's name. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4906.4s)]
*  I should know the name, but like great example of this. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4907.28s)]
*  Like you can do it. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4910.32s)]
*  You can pull your country out of extreme poverty, but you cannot do it without the natural [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4911.6s)]
*  resources. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4916.88s)]
*  Like the number one, like because without that, you just have nothing to pull from. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4918.16s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4921.599999999999s)]
*  Tourism? [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4922.08s)]
*  Nobody wants to go there. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4922.4s)]
*  People getting shot. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4923.12s)]
*  They think your country is full of AIDS. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4923.839999999999s)]
*  They think. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4925.28s)]
*  They think. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4926.5599999999995s)]
*  No, but like unfortunately that is the perception, right? [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4927.04s)]
*  So people aren't going for like cute little vacations over there. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4929.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4931.36s)]
*  One of the reasons why we can go to the Caribbean and all this kind of stuff is because we're [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4931.679999999999s)]
*  like, oh, it's safe. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4934.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4935.28s)]
*  Burkina Faso is in a tough spot because they're landlocked. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4936.24s)]
*  So they require and rely on all their neighboring countries for transportation. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4938.48s)]
*  Botswana too. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4941.92s)]
*  So those are the ones that are most difficult because they're also easily [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4944.08s)]
*  invaded. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4947.2s)]
*  Yep. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4947.76s)]
*  You're so dependent on the people around you. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4948.4s)]
*  Can you check to see if it is that guy? [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4950.0s)]
*  And then what's interesting is that a lot of people in Burkina Faso now, Ibrahim is [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4953.04s)]
*  kind of like partnering with the Russians a little. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4956.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh boy. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4958.32s)]
*  Like trying to get some infrastructure, trying to like cozy up with them because you kind [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4959.04s)]
*  of do need a little bit of a partner. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4963.04s)]
*  Yep. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4966.0s)]
*  So now Russia's like, hey, you've been screwed over by the French, the Americans, [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4966.32s)]
*  da da da. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4970.0s)]
*  And the American diplomats are like, hey, this coup thing is crazy. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4970.8s)]
*  And the Russians are kind of helping them out. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4973.5199999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4974.88s)]
*  What is it? [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4977.12s)]
*  So let's say Kama. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4977.68s)]
*  Yeah, Kama. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4979.36s)]
*  And then we'll say Kama's elected as first president. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4981.2s)]
*  And then he was just like, I mean, it's a great YouTube video I watch on it. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4983.04s)]
*  And like some of these guys do these like really in-depth, you know, historical accounts [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4987.12s)]
*  on YouTube, like really like well-researched with imagery and all that stuff. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4995.36s)]
*  But this guy, Kama, I think he's no longer in power. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=4998.8s)]
*  And I think the guy who followed him, there isn't like tons of support. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5001.2s)]
*  But I imagine he was in power for years. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5004.24s)]
*  I think he had like a white wife too. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5005.92s)]
*  And that was a little bit. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5007.5199999999995s)]
*  Snow bunnies, man. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5008.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, he got snow-buddied a little bit. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5009.44s)]
*  I think he was educated in England. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5010.8s)]
*  I'm not mistaken. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5013.599999999999s)]
*  I just hope we start seeing more of this happen in Africa and that countries just get [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5014.88s)]
*  their resources back because there's so much wealth in Africa and it's just being fucking. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5020.08s)]
*  Well, that's why. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5025.04s)]
*  Yeah, you get people partnering and like the tricky thing is you kind of need these people [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5026.64s)]
*  to be educated outside of their country because if they're educated within their country, [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5036.32s)]
*  they're probably part of the propaganda machine that's kept people at bay. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5041.360000000001s)]
*  So it's almost like you want them to go to the colonial powers so they can learn what [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5046.96s)]
*  happened to their country in the most effective way. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5050.56s)]
*  And then like go to these like institutions like Oxford or Harvard or that kind of stuff. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5053.2s)]
*  And like you'd like study business or geopolitics and you learn how trade actually works. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5057.2s)]
*  And then you can start to broker these deals and build these relationships with the other countries. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5062.72s)]
*  Especially right now where like everybody's terrified of the value of currency. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5067.04s)]
*  Like I think gold is at like $3,000 a pound or something in the same price. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5071.92s)]
*  So right now is the perfect time to own your fucking gold, right? [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5075.76s)]
*  Wow. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5078.88s)]
*  You know? [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5079.5199999999995s)]
*  That's fascinating. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5079.92s)]
*  Yeah, because that's the hedge against currency. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5080.72s)]
*  And he's hooking up the farmers too. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5083.280000000001s)]
*  He's like giving farmers free tractors. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5084.56s)]
*  Like he's like so far it seems like everyone likes him. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5086.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5090.240000000001s)]
*  This is since 2022. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5090.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5092.16s)]
*  What he does with this sort of unchecked power we shall see. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5092.56s)]
*  That's the thing. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5095.76s)]
*  You need someone who's like truly benevolent. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5096.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5098.240000000001s)]
*  Can you make sure that was right about that Botswana guy? [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5098.8s)]
*  I don't want to get that wrong. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5100.72s)]
*  And then I think there's like a movement in South Africa. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5101.76s)]
*  There's a YouTube video called [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5104.16s)]
*  Surreza Ecoma Life Legacy of Africa's Best President Ever. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5105.6s)]
*  So I wonder what that is. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5108.400000000001s)]
*  That's the one. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5109.2s)]
*  It might be, but there's a few that have been done on it. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5110.08s)]
*  But it's specifically like what he did. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5112.4s)]
*  At a certain point there was like invasions. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5114.4s)]
*  He's like, OK, well, oh, the first thing was after naturalization, [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5116.08s)]
*  it was investing in education. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5119.04s)]
*  He's like, because an educated populace [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5120.639999999999s)]
*  is going to continue to innovate. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5122.719999999999s)]
*  His wife was white, it looks like. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5126.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5127.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5128.32s)]
*  He had this step to being a first world country or whatever it is. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5129.04s)]
*  And he fucking knocked it out of the park. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5133.5199999999995s)]
*  But naturally having the resources was amazing. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5136.719999999999s)]
*  I think at one point, Botswana was like part of Zimbabwe [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5139.84s)]
*  or something like that. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5142.24s)]
*  But like there was, he had to worry about invasions. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5143.84s)]
*  He's like, OK, now we have to invest in military. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5146.08s)]
*  Like he just went through the process [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5148.08s)]
*  and he had enough support from the people. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5149.6s)]
*  And it's possible. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5151.76s)]
*  I guess that's the point is like it is possible. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5153.52s)]
*  You just got to be immune to that corruption, though. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5155.4400000000005s)]
*  That's hard. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5157.28s)]
*  You get a seat at the table and they're like, bro. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5157.76s)]
*  Yeah, no, that's rough. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5159.92s)]
*  Let's just give you everything you've ever wanted. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5160.8s)]
*  Like he grew up in a town of 2,000 people [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5162.400000000001s)]
*  in the middle of Burkina Faso, one of the most poor countries ever. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5164.96s)]
*  And now people are going to him being like, yo, let's do a deal. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5167.92s)]
*  Let's work this out. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5170.64s)]
*  You'll be a millionaire, that billionaire. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5171.4400000000005s)]
*  And you got to be able to be like, no, I'm good. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5173.76s)]
*  I'm going to help my people. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5175.360000000001s)]
*  What if you're that guy? [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5176.88s)]
*  You got something, Joey? [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5178.24s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5179.04s)]
*  So like what if there's a like I think about this all the time [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5181.12s)]
*  with Bukele. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5184.24s)]
*  I would love to have the El Salvadorian president on it [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5184.96s)]
*  because it's like, did you see the I think it's him, [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5187.28s)]
*  but he just got caught selling a bunch of coke. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5191.360000000001s)]
*  Bukele? [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5195.04s)]
*  I'm pretty sure. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5195.76s)]
*  What? [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5196.400000000001s)]
*  I would look that up. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5196.96s)]
*  Before I congratulate him. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5199.4400000000005s)]
*  He owns some coffee business in Miami and they just, [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5201.76s)]
*  it was a huge bust of like 30 million dollars worth of cocaine [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5206.72s)]
*  that was supposed to be shipped to Germany. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5210.64s)]
*  Like these motherfuckers are crazy. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5214.88s)]
*  But check that, just double check, but I'm pretty sure that was, [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5217.4400000000005s)]
*  and it's like Western media isn't covering it. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5219.84s)]
*  Only like Latin American news is covering it [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5222.08s)]
*  and they're trying to keep it like super hush up. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5224.4800000000005s)]
*  And so he's doing what the CIA did. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5226.32s)]
*  Nice. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5230.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5231.12s)]
*  That's that get back. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5231.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5231.92s)]
*  Like, or what we did in Afghanistan [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5233.44s)]
*  where we took all the heroin fields. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5234.88s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5236.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5236.96s)]
*  Don't sell it in your own country. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5237.28s)]
*  But if Canada can sell asbestos to Thailand, [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5240.16s)]
*  then why can't El Salvador sell coke to some other countries? [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5243.04s)]
*  Like it's what we tell people all the time. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5246.48s)]
*  Like the issue is taking advantage of your own people [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5248.16s)]
*  so that you can get rich. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5251.28s)]
*  Fucking over other people, we seem to look the other way. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5253.12s)]
*  America's done it. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5256.08s)]
*  A bunch of other countries done it. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5256.88s)]
*  It seems like that's how you become a superpower in a way. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5257.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5260.16s)]
*  Whether it's through colonization or through selling narcotics. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5260.48s)]
*  But like there's a market for this shit. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5264.0s)]
*  The problem is, is when it just completely erodes the fabric of your society. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5266.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5270.96s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a break for a second. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5271.44s)]
*  I'm about to show you the most patriotic way to stay alert, [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5272.96s)]
*  stay energetic and stay free. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5275.6s)]
*  It's black rifle energy. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5277.84s)]
*  Yes, they have the coffee. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5280.0s)]
*  Obviously, we've been running on the coffee. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5281.2s)]
*  Okay. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5283.44s)]
*  We've been running on the coffee for years. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5283.76s)]
*  Keeping us up, making sure we vote, making sure we stay free. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5285.84s)]
*  Okay. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5290.400000000001s)]
*  Storming the Capitol. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5291.12s)]
*  I can't say that everybody was on it or they weren't. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5292.24s)]
*  I'm not legally allowed to say that. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5295.52s)]
*  My prediction is that just because it is so prolific, it was probably around. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5297.52s)]
*  It did not cause that at all. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5304.0s)]
*  I'm sure during the Civil War, you know what? [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5306.32s)]
*  Black rifle coffee would be used by the North. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5309.4400000000005s)]
*  By the North. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5312.0s)]
*  By the North. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5312.32s)]
*  By the North. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5313.04s)]
*  Okay. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5313.84s)]
*  By the North. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5314.24s)]
*  All right? [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5315.36s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5316.32s)]
*  That's why they won. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5317.04s)]
*  Yeah, I would think. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5317.92s)]
*  But maybe there were times where the South maybe got a storage unit or something that [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5319.04s)]
*  the North had. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5322.24s)]
*  Maybe they used it for a little bit. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5322.88s)]
*  Put up a good fight. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5324.48s)]
*  But ultimately, the North had it and that's why they were so prolific. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5325.28s)]
*  Revolutionary War, 100%. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5328.8s)]
*  Threw that fucking tea into the water. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5330.4s)]
*  Slurped down a black rifle coffee. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5332.08s)]
*  Got the French to help us out. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5334.0s)]
*  The French were drinking espresso. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5335.2s)]
*  We're like, listen, queers, why don't you take a black rifle energy drink or some coffee [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5336.48s)]
*  and let's win this war in a day or two. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5341.28s)]
*  Done. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5343.36s)]
*  That's what happened. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5343.759999999999s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5344.64s)]
*  I need a little bit more on that. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5345.6s)]
*  That was worse. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5347.92s)]
*  It sounds like you need some black rifle energy. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5349.280000000001s)]
*  That's what it sounds like. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5351.04s)]

*  Joffrey. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5600.64s)]
*  Joffrey type shit. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5601.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5602.160000000001s)]
*  And Saddam would try to reel him in and would burn his cars. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5602.72s)]
*  He owned a bunch of nice cars and he burned his cars one time to threaten him. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5610.8s)]
*  He put him in jail for a night, but Saddam couldn't really reel him in. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5614.08s)]
*  But also- [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5618.08s)]
*  I'm going to count to three, Uday. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5618.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5619.84s)]
*  Keep torturing. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5620.4800000000005s)]
*  But Saddam would also then name other people his successor and it would piss Uday off even more. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5621.6s)]
*  He had his crazy shit happen. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5627.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5629.92s)]
*  When you know there's no repercussions to your actions, you're going to act out. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5630.5599999999995s)]
*  He tortured the Olympic team. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5635.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5637.679999999999s)]
*  He was like one of the most brutal dudes ever. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5638.08s)]
*  The stuff he did, it was insane. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5640.5599999999995s)]
*  There's old documentaries on his atrocities where he's just like [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5642.5599999999995s)]
*  pulling people off the street, fucking murdering them. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5645.599999999999s)]
*  Also, where does he learn that shit? [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5647.599999999999s)]
*  You don't learn that shit from the movies. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5649.36s)]
*  You're seeing that within your family dynamic or at least you're seeing your dad use power [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5650.96s)]
*  in that way and you think it's okay. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5656.4s)]
*  Got his uncle shot. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5657.759999999999s)]
*  He did some wild stuff. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5658.88s)]
*  Or you can just step it up. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5660.96s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5664.48s)]
*  But maybe there's a version where he feels like stepping it up is currying favor with his father. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5664.96s)]
*  I'm not trying to say that Saddam is this fucking- [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5671.04s)]
*  No, I'm saying he's a guy. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5674.08s)]
*  I guess my point is he's not this great guy. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5674.72s)]
*  Just think. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5675.92s)]
*  His son is even worse. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5676.4s)]
*  I've seen kids like this on much lower levels where it's just like you got this rich kid. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5678.16s)]
*  You guys probably grew up with them and they never really get in trouble for anything. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5682.32s)]
*  You went to private school. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5687.28s)]
*  Shut up. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5688.16s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5688.48s)]
*  You went to private school. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5690.0s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5690.8s)]
*  It was private. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5692.0s)]
*  Your bard was, you had to take a test to get in, but there was no payment for it. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5692.72s)]
*  I thought bard was private. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5697.04s)]
*  No, it's public. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5698.16s)]
*  Not public. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5699.84s)]
*  I mean, you have to test to get into the school, but outside of that, there's no payment for it. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5700.64s)]
*  Swear to God. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5705.76s)]
*  Come on, son. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5707.36s)]
*  I'm just smart. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5707.92s)]
*  But the tricky thing now with Ibrahim is that all these other countries want authoritarian leaders. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5710.88s)]
*  There's a push towards authoritarianism because he's been so great so far that now [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5714.88s)]
*  are you going to have other countries in the region being like, where's our Ibrahim? [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5719.68s)]
*  And then are you going to get bad actors that are like, I'll do it? [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5722.56s)]
*  I actually think he's right though. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5725.360000000001s)]
*  I don't think democracy is the quickest way to progress. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5726.4800000000005s)]
*  Democracy led us to civil war. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5730.72s)]
*  Maybe not the quickest. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5732.8s)]
*  In fairness, he said no democracy has led to prosperity or something like that. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5733.52s)]
*  Well, that's bullshit. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5737.200000000001s)]
*  He has a quote about democracy. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5737.92s)]
*  The quickest way is what Singapore did. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5738.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5741.84s)]
*  Like 50 years, you go from a jungle to a first world country. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5742.4800000000005s)]
*  Like the quickest way is you have like a party in charge and you hope to God they're benevolent [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5745.92s)]
*  and then you ride that shit till wheels fall off. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5751.28s)]
*  And then maybe then once a culture is set, you could start to create some form of democracy. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5753.2s)]
*  But I have a hard time believing that like you just go, oh yeah, [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5757.84s)]
*  we'll vote and everything will be perfect. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5760.24s)]
*  It's like you haven't even established what the culture is, what you guys need, [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5761.679999999999s)]
*  what the identity is. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5765.2s)]
*  You need like educated populists, you need people that have access to info. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5766.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5768.88s)]
*  People are so easily manipulated, especially now with the internet. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5770.08s)]
*  You're going to just let democracy happen in Burkina Faso. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5772.48s)]
*  Just hand out cell phones to these people in the middle of wherever the fuck they're living. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5775.5199999999995s)]
*  And like, yeah, you're going to see some shit get riled up. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5780.08s)]
*  No. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5782.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5783.92s)]
*  No country is developed under democracy. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5784.16s)]
*  I also don't think that people give a fuck about democracy anymore. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5785.76s)]
*  Like I think that was like, no, like, I mean, that's funny. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5788.88s)]
*  But no, I mean, like, you know how like we used to feel like it was our job to spread democracy? [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5794.0s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5799.6s)]
*  Like I don't think Americans care about spreading that shit. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5800.16s)]
*  Like we just want people that agree with our way of living. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5802.72s)]
*  So if you've got a dictator that agrees with it, bet. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5806.72s)]
*  If you got a prime minister, bet. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5809.92s)]
*  Yeah. It's so crazy. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5812.64s)]
*  Even like Vietnam time, how they convince people that communism was like an existential threat. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5813.360000000001s)]
*  I do think that is true. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5818.0s)]
*  But like, how do they get people to be like, yo, we got to stop it? [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5819.2s)]
*  Well, I got to look more into this like McCarthy shit or like the MacArthur, [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5822.88s)]
*  MacArthur, MacArthur. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5826.16s)]
*  I got to look into those hearings because he might have been right about that shit. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5827.68s)]
*  Because I think that there is like I think communism is very seductive, right? [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5830.639999999999s)]
*  Especially when it's not applied. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5835.5199999999995s)]
*  When it's not applied, it looks like the best thing ever. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5837.599999999999s)]
*  Like we have to support people. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5839.839999999999s)]
*  We have to help poor people have a part of the industries in which they work. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5841.04s)]
*  So they're not just cogs in the machine. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5845.919999999999s)]
*  And if you have a populace, especially in a time like now, which it feels like jobs are hard to get [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5847.839999999999s)]
*  and they're slowly like being more and more taken advantage of by the wealthy, [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5852.959999999999s)]
*  introducing an idea like communism, call it something else. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5858.88s)]
*  Americans would be like, really into it. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5861.84s)]
*  This sounds great. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5863.68s)]
*  If done right, it's actually a great thing. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5864.64s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5866.56s)]
*  But never done right. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5867.04s)]
*  But like the fact that it sounds like a great thing can easily sway an uneducated populace [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5868.24s)]
*  or even an educated one. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5873.68s)]
*  Matter of fact, sometimes education is even better, right? [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5874.88s)]
*  Because you'll see like what the true benefits of these things are. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5878.24s)]
*  So I understand Americans at that time going, shit, this is spreading because all these poor [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5881.84s)]
*  people around the world really want some equity in the industries that they're building up. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5887.36s)]
*  If that continues to spread, it could easily spread over here because why wouldn't every [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5891.759999999999s)]
*  American want that? [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5895.5199999999995s)]
*  But that could kill, potentially could kill American prosperity if it's not done right. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5896.639999999999s)]
*  So I get like it as an existential threat. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5902.32s)]
*  Us being over there in Vietnam, I don't know why we think like if Vietnam falls, [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5905.2s)]
*  then Kansas City does. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5909.12s)]
*  But I do get the idea that like, uh-oh, this shit is kind of catching steam. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5910.799999999999s)]
*  And then I furthermore get why the rich people in America would really not want that. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5915.12s)]
*  So it's like, it's almost like double incentivized. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5921.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5925.28s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5926.08s)]
*  Like the rich people were like, we definitely don't want this is going to fuck our business up. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5926.72s)]
*  And then like the permanent government people going, yeah, it hasn't really worked in any [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5930.32s)]
*  of these other places, but it's really seductive. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5934.72s)]
*  All right, we're in cahoots on this one where there might be things that the rich people [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5937.44s)]
*  really like, but the American government is like, nah, you got monopolistic practices. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5941.92s)]
*  We need to break that shit up because it's actually going to fuck people over. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5946.32s)]
*  And the rich be like, no, no, that's what we do. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5948.8s)]
*  We fuck people over. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5950.64s)]
*  And again, you're not going to do it now. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5951.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5952.96s)]
*  So when rich people in government are aligned, you're fucked. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5954.16s)]
*  Right? [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5958.4800000000005s)]
*  When rich people in government are not aligned, there's a battle. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5959.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5962.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5964.64s)]
*  But yeah, it'll be interesting to see. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5965.68s)]
*  Play that other video. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5966.8s)]
*  Wait, which one? [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5968.56s)]
*  The one with the, about the drugs. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5969.36s)]
*  What's up guys? [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5971.84s)]
*  So pretty much Bukele owns a coffee brand called Beans of Fire, which is based in Miami. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5972.32s)]
*  And they just got caught with $31 million worth of snow powder. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5977.28s)]
*  You know what I'm talking about? [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5981.28s)]
*  $31 million in their shipment to Belgium. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5982.96s)]
*  So the president personally owns, Bukele personally owns a coffee brand [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5986.08s)]
*  that's based in Miami that's caught shipping drugs to Belgium. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5989.36s)]
*  But for some reason, nobody's talking about it except Hispanic news sources. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5993.679999999999s)]
*  So Bukele responded at saying that somebody's trying to smear him. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=5997.599999999999s)]
*  So let me get this straight. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6000.8s)]
*  Somebody put $31 million worth of snow powder in a shipment just to smear dictator Guanabee. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6001.92s)]
*  And why does he own a coffee company based in Miami? [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6009.6s)]
*  This is what I told you guys. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6012.72s)]
*  This is what Duerte did in the Philippines. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6013.84s)]
*  Pretty much they took out the competition in El Salvador. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6015.84s)]
*  He took out his drug rivals in El Salvador and they are becoming the main providers of drugs, [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6018.320000000001s)]
*  the main sellers, the main cartel. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6023.76s)]
*  And that's why he's best friends with Donald Trump. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6025.4400000000005s)]
*  So our tax dollars are going to a drug dealer in El Salvador. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6028.0s)]
*  I'm not, yo, low key, I'm not against this. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6030.96s)]
*  It's fucked up. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6035.04s)]
*  Go on it, go on it. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6035.84s)]
*  It's fucked up, but the world is fucked up. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6037.84s)]
*  Okay. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6039.92s)]
*  So like when asbestos was banned in Canada, they were still selling it to like Vietnam or [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6040.4800000000005s)]
*  Thailand or some shit like that. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6045.12s)]
*  Like they already recognized that asbestos was causing cancer. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6046.24s)]
*  So they banned in their own country, but they were still shipping it out to their [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6049.92s)]
*  real countries where they would eventually go get cancer. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6053.04s)]
*  And I don't know if it was as direct as asbestos. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6055.52s)]
*  Maybe asbestos was in like the drywall or whatever the fuck they were sending. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6058.88s)]
*  But like they knew that there was something that was banned in their country that they [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6062.400000000001s)]
*  were sending out to the world. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6064.72s)]
*  I think this shit probably happens a lot. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6065.84s)]
*  I think that there's probably chemicals that we create here that we're like, ah, this isn't [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6068.0s)]
*  good for our food, but we'll send it out to other countries. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6071.4400000000005s)]
*  But why are you okay with that? [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6073.68s)]
*  I'm okay with it. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6075.76s)]
*  I'm not saying it's good, but what I'm saying is I don't know if this is dissimilar to [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6076.72s)]
*  practices that we and other like righteous first world countries do. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6080.8s)]
*  Therefore, I get it, but I'm still against it. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6085.52s)]
*  I would say, hey, of course, don't do it. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6087.36s)]
*  The right thing is to say don't do it. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6090.719999999999s)]
*  But the other thing is to be like, okay, we have all these fields. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6092.4s)]
*  We've we've seized the fields. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6095.2s)]
*  We have all this cocaine. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6096.639999999999s)]
*  We can find ways to sell it. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6098.16s)]
*  We can profit off it, whether we continue to do it or not, is, I guess, up to us as a [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6099.759999999999s)]
*  country. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6103.44s)]
*  They get to decide whether cocaine is illegal to sell for people or for the government in [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6104.16s)]
*  their country. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6108.639999999999s)]
*  Canada decided that it was illegal, but they still were producing and selling it. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6109.2s)]
*  So it's your product. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6112.5599999999995s)]
*  If other countries want it, they can find a way to get there. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6114.16s)]
*  Like, and listen, it's fucked up. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6118.48s)]
*  What to me is most important is that you're prioritizing your own people. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6121.5199999999995s)]
*  So if you're uplifting your own people through what we would deem as like nefarious acts, [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6125.84s)]
*  yeah, maybe it's like a little bit. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6131.599999999999s)]
*  Maybe it's bad. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6133.28s)]
*  Maybe a lot of bad, but it is less bad than selling those drugs to your own people. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6134.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6139.599999999999s)]
*  Is it possible that there's a cartel that's like, yo, we're going to ship this stuff. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6140.24s)]
*  We own the shipping and we're going to throw our own product in there and then we'll get [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6143.52s)]
*  sorted out when it lands. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6146.400000000001s)]
*  I also don't. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6147.76s)]
*  Not only do I think that's possible, I also think it's possible that there is somebody [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6149.120000000001s)]
*  trying to smear him. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6152.56s)]
*  Perhaps. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6154.160000000001s)]
*  Like, I think it's very possible you have someone with that much power, that much support, [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6154.64s)]
*  and he's saying certain things that are disrupting. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6158.320000000001s)]
*  I won't say disrupting governments. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6163.120000000001s)]
*  $30 million to smear a person. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6164.96s)]
*  Again, these cartels make crazy money. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6167.280000000001s)]
*  Like, $31 million. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6168.8s)]
*  It's almost tricky because it's like it is a lot of money objectively, of course, [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6169.76s)]
*  but if you're a cartel with hundreds of millions, billions, it's like, oh, we can use this for [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6173.28s)]
*  political leverage or, yo, we're just going to throw this in our shipment. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6178.16s)]
*  And maybe that's the only one that got caught. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6181.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6183.28s)]
*  Like, they might even take all these. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6184.0s)]
*  The cartels and you take out all the criminals, like aren't they, they're supposed to be all [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6186.16s)]
*  locked up right now. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6190.48s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6191.2s)]
*  It's like if this shit is still happening, the government in the job, you know what's [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6192.32s)]
*  going to happen. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6196.24s)]
*  Or does the government take it over and then it's like a national resource? [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6196.719999999999s)]
*  That's what seems more likely. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6200.0s)]
*  Look, if America was trading the fucking heroin in Afghanistan, which I don't know. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6202.4s)]
*  I don't have like factual evidence that we did that. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6208.24s)]
*  I think at some point in time we did take over like the poppy production, which eventually [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6210.719999999999s)]
*  becomes the heroin. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6214.799999999999s)]
*  Like, and if that was part of the GDP of Afghanistan and they recognize it and they're [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6215.679999999999s)]
*  like, well, we can either give them the money or we can fucking sell this shit. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6219.92s)]
*  Are we really going to shit on El Salvador for doing it? [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6223.839999999999s)]
*  I guess to me, what's most important is if you're trying to uplift a country from poverty, [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6227.36s)]
*  destitute poverty and violence, like there's probably going to be, you're going to crack [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6231.36s)]
*  some eggs on the way. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6235.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6236.4s)]
*  And I'm not greater good is is how are the people doing it now? [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6236.719999999999s)]
*  The cost of how those people doing are how people in Belgium are snorting coke. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6240.799999999999s)]
*  I'm like boohoo. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6245.2s)]
*  If he's selling asbestos to third world countries, so his people can be okay. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6246.639999999999s)]
*  It's like, okay, you're fucking over more poor people so that your poor people can get [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6249.92s)]
*  rich. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6254.16s)]
*  I'm not saying it's okay to fuck over rich people, but like I imagine in Belgium you [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6254.96s)]
*  have a choice whether or not you're going to buy fucking cocaine and snort it when you [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6258.0s)]
*  go out drinking. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6260.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6262.4800000000005s)]
*  And then gatekeeping a different country doing the shit that a bunch of first world countries [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6262.96s)]
*  do. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6267.84s)]
*  Wait, what does that, what does that mean? [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6268.08s)]
*  Like a bunch of first world countries do a bunch of fuck shit to get rich and then other [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6268.96s)]
*  countries try to do it. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6272.88s)]
*  And then, we did that shit like low key. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6273.4400000000005s)]
*  I kind of feel like we did that shit with the industrial revolution. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6276.88s)]
*  It's like we were polluting the whole fucking world. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6280.16s)]
*  It came industrial superpower. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6282.88s)]
*  Then the rest of these countries try to do it. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6284.64s)]
*  We're like, we have to worry about the environment. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6286.24s)]
*  Like China, what are you doing? [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6287.6s)]
*  Smog. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6288.88s)]
*  I'm not trying to make some pro China argument, but it's like, what do you think our skies [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6290.0s)]
*  look like from 1800s to 1960? [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6293.28s)]
*  But it's kind of smart though. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6296.0s)]
*  100%. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6296.96s)]
*  It is kind of smart if you're running it. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6297.5199999999995s)]
*  If you're America, then like, yeah, you guys can't do what we did. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6299.5199999999995s)]
*  So this is what I'm saying. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6302.24s)]
*  The expectations for your country are different for the expectations for the world. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6304.48s)]
*  And I'm kind of okay with that shit. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6308.48s)]
*  And if we can use these different levers to apply leverage so it's more beneficial to us, [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6310.4s)]
*  I'm kind of okay with that. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6315.599999999999s)]
*  We don't live in this utopia where every country just wants every other country to do well. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6317.04s)]
*  This shit is a race. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6321.76s)]
*  So we got to treat it like a race. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6323.2s)]
*  I wouldn't say I'm okay, but I do recognize the game. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6324.4s)]
*  Maybe okay isn't the right word. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6326.4s)]
*  I recognize game. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6327.84s)]
*  I'm like, yeah. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6328.72s)]
*  This is the game and we have to play it within the confines of our ethics. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6329.5199999999995s)]
*  And the ethics within our country are different. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6335.04s)]
*  And we acknowledge this than outside of our country. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6337.28s)]
*  And we got allies and then the ethics with our allies are like a little bit closer to us. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6339.84s)]
*  So how we treat Great Britain is going to be a little different than how we treat some [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6345.52s)]
*  Third World countries. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6349.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6349.84s)]
*  And what we're willing to do. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6350.32s)]
*  And I'm not pearl clutching. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6351.2s)]
*  These guys are the mafia. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6353.52s)]
*  I'm like everyone's the mafia. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6354.4800000000005s)]
*  Everyone's the mafia. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6355.36s)]
*  Okay. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6356.56s)]
*  I hate when we get too far into Trumps, but this stuff is like, [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6358.32s)]
*  I feel he's moving in a way that's just like so in your face. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6362.72s)]
*  Before it's like rich people just pay behind the scenes. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6366.8s)]
*  You don't really know who is doing the shit. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6369.2s)]
*  Now you think it's blatant. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6370.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6371.4400000000005s)]
*  Like what are the examples of that? [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6372.0s)]
*  I'm not saying you're wrong, but like the crypto coin thing, like where it's like, [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6373.44s)]
*  what do you do? [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6377.679999999999s)]
*  So now it's the top 50 holders get a meeting with Trump. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6378.719999999999s)]
*  Just paying for access. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6386.16s)]
*  So he's essentially selling access. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6389.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6390.96s)]
*  Now, I guess it is a little crazy. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6392.48s)]
*  So I agree with what you're saying, which is like, what you're doing is you are pulling [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6394.719999999999s)]
*  away the curtain. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6400.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6401.759999999999s)]
*  And like, and I don't know if that's good or bad. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6402.4s)]
*  Well, the thing is that we like curtains. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6405.12s)]
*  We like curtains. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6409.44s)]
*  Curtains help everybody. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6410.16s)]
*  They keep your private ship private and my private ship private. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6411.2s)]
*  And what we do behind those curtains, nobody really knows about. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6414.08s)]
*  And if people don't know about it, we can pretend it's not happening. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6417.2s)]
*  And the reality is the rich people always pay for access. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6420.5599999999995s)]
*  Goldman Sachs did it with Obama. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6423.92s)]
*  Somebody other company did it with Trump. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6425.679999999999s)]
*  Some other company did it with common. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6427.28s)]
*  Like all these countries are paying for access. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6428.639999999999s)]
*  There's a reason why all those billionaire corporations were lined up behind Trump during [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6430.48s)]
*  the inauguration. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6433.759999999999s)]
*  And they gave him the million bucks. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6434.799999999999s)]
*  He like they paid for access. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6435.919999999999s)]
*  But what he's saying is, hey, guys, we do pay for access here. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6437.759999999999s)]
*  And I think the American people are like, why don't you just lie to us and do it like [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6443.2s)]
*  y'all did before? [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6447.679999999999s)]
*  We don't want to think that that's how things work. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6448.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6450.719999999999s)]
*  So I know it seems like I'm probably defending him. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6451.2s)]
*  I'm not. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6454.48s)]
*  I agree. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6455.12s)]
*  I like to think that there is no access paid for. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6455.679999999999s)]
*  The problem is, is that I wonder if him and other I wonder if his administration specifically [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6459.2s)]
*  since he was one of those people that paid for access, I wonder if he's like, doesn't [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6466.4s)]
*  everybody know this is how it works? [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6470.0s)]
*  Now we're just letting people pay for access. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6472.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6474.48s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6475.12s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6475.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6475.759999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6476.16s)]
*  That's why I asked the question. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6476.48s)]
*  It's like no judgment. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6477.44s)]
*  I was like, I don't even know if it's a good thing or a bad thing. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6478.24s)]
*  But it's just like, it's just so different than how things have always been done. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6480.16s)]
*  You know what it is? [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6483.36s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6484.0s)]
*  It's like when you're at one of these fancy events and like, you know, somebody's like, [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6484.639999999999s)]
*  somebody's eating their food the way you would just eat your fucking food. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6488.799999999999s)]
*  Like if I got a chicken tender, I'm eating with my fingers and all these other fancy [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6491.599999999999s)]
*  people like, why do they, we eat this with a fork and knife. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6494.799999999999s)]
*  It's like, you're only doing that because everybody else here would look at you funny. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6497.44s)]
*  But when we're all home alone, we eat with our fingers. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6501.599999999999s)]
*  Now, I don't know if that's, I don't think that that's a good justification, by the way. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6504.32s)]
*  I think that there should be no pay for access. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6509.04s)]
*  I don't think it should be transparent or I don't think it should be. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6511.679999999999s)]
*  On the face. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6515.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6516.4s)]
*  Either way. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6516.96s)]
*  So I get that reaction you have. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6517.84s)]
*  You're like, what the fuck is happening over here? [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6519.76s)]
*  And I guess I just wonder if like, if they're going, yeah, this is how it is. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6522.0s)]
*  We're just telling you. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6527.12s)]
*  Probably. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6528.08s)]
*  Well, that's kind of the accelerationist thing where it's like, [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6528.400000000001s)]
*  there's people that don't like Trump that are like, it's good what he's doing because [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6531.04s)]
*  he's airing it all out. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6533.84s)]
*  And then hopefully people will see how corrupt everything is and then we can fix it. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6535.52s)]
*  Let him air it all out. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6539.6s)]
*  Let him do all these things where they expose how corrupt everything is. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6540.64s)]
*  And what he's doing is wrong. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6543.68s)]
*  But the next thing will be better because we can stop it. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6544.72s)]
*  Oh, got it. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6547.5199999999995s)]
*  So Trump is not airing it out in a way to expose other people. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6548.4s)]
*  He's even exposing himself. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6552.24s)]
*  This is what they would say. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6554.32s)]
*  But through exposing himself, he is exposing the system that does exist just behind closed doors. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6555.12s)]
*  And once we're all privy to the system that does exist, then we can change it. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6560.8s)]
*  Because that's what I feel like his administration does all the time. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6564.8s)]
*  The second they do something with immigrants, they just go, oh, look how many immigrants. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6567.36s)]
*  But I think Obama was like, I was Obama's wife. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6571.84s)]
*  Michelle was like, I was crying when I saw the deportations. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6574.56s)]
*  And then they were like, your husband deported four million more people than he did. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6579.360000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6583.76s)]
*  Like, and I think that's what the Republicans get a lot of wins on, [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6584.0s)]
*  is that the Democrats kind of virtue signal without reflecting on what they've done. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6587.6s)]
*  And then the Republicans come in and dunk. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6591.76s)]
*  So what Mark is saying is like, the next 10 years or whatever it is, could be a reflection [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6594.64s)]
*  on what both parties have done, either out in the open or behind closed doors. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6600.320000000001s)]
*  And then we as Americans get to go, yeah, we don't like any of that. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6604.56s)]
*  That's ugly. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6608.080000000001s)]
*  You hope we do that. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6609.120000000001s)]
*  Either fix it or put up some more curtains. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6609.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6612.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6612.88s)]
*  Or I don't know, maybe what I'm curious what you think. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6613.360000000001s)]
*  Do we just take all the curtains away and just kind of be honest with who we are? [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6616.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6620.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't know if you can have a society function that way, though. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6620.72s)]
*  Probably not. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6623.52s)]
*  I have no idea. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6624.56s)]
*  I don't know if any country has really done that where like all the curtains are off. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6625.200000000001s)]
*  Actually, this is the Vietnam thing. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6628.0s)]
*  I'm watching that documentary on Netflix right now. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6629.280000000001s)]
*  I want to hear about that rat thing too. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6630.8s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6632.240000000001s)]
*  That's just far. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6632.8s)]
*  Did you get into that? [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6633.6s)]
*  Did you do the episode on it already? [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6634.48s)]
*  Okay. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6635.919999999999s)]
*  But we can talk about it. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6636.16s)]
*  Does it conflict if we talk about it here? [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6637.2s)]
*  No, no, no, not at all. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6639.2s)]
*  But the Vietnam thing, they made an interesting point in the doc where they're like, [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6640.16s)]
*  that is the moment where America, the curtain started to tear. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6643.599999999999s)]
*  That was the moment. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6647.599999999999s)]
*  Because right after World War II, I imagine we are heroic. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6649.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6652.08s)]
*  Virtuous, benevolent, kind, caring. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6652.5599999999995s)]
*  Our Americans died for other people to live, [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6655.679999999999s)]
*  and there's nothing more beautiful than that. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6658.4s)]
*  And then through the 50s, you got some Pacific theater stuff, [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6660.08s)]
*  but it's like, oh, they're just patching up World War II. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6662.16s)]
*  No one even really knows what's going on. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6663.76s)]
*  And then Vietnam is the first moment where it's like, [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6665.4400000000005s)]
*  yes, we're going to do it again. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6667.4400000000005s)]
*  We're going back out. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6668.56s)]
*  And then they get out there and they're like, why are we, what are we doing? [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6669.84s)]
*  Why are we here? [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6672.64s)]
*  What is the point of all this? [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6673.92s)]
*  And then you start to see the tears come in, [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6675.360000000001s)]
*  all the conspiracy stuff comes in around that time. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6678.4800000000005s)]
*  JFK, obviously, the Gulf of Tonkin stuff. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6681.04s)]
*  What is America actually? [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6684.400000000001s)]
*  And is it good or bad? [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6686.320000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6687.4400000000005s)]
*  You get a rise in conspiratorial thinking. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6687.76s)]
*  I imagine. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6690.16s)]
*  Is it good or bad? [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6690.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6691.52s)]
*  I imagine like upon learning these things, [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6692.08s)]
*  like during that time, I imagine upon, like once you see tears in that fabric, [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6695.6s)]
*  there's an extreme pendulum swing where everything becomes conspiracy, [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6701.04s)]
*  which is not dissimilar to kind of what's happening now, [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6705.68s)]
*  which is like, whoa, we've seen some fabric tears like big time. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6708.4s)]
*  And then the conspiracy ship went crazy. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6712.24s)]
*  And the craziest version is flat earth. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6714.72s)]
*  But the fact that we could believe everything is a conspiracy. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6717.84s)]
*  Like Bukele said, they're smearing me. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6721.44s)]
*  And my knee jerk reaction was like, that could happen. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6722.96s)]
*  Things have happened like that. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6726.719999999999s)]
*  Or he could just be selling the... [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6728.879999999999s)]
*  Like, okay, so that's Vietnam era disillusion. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6730.4s)]
*  Have we ever recovered from that? [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6739.839999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6742.4s)]
*  I mean, no. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6744.08s)]
*  I think the cracks are still there, [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6746.24s)]
*  but as long as everything's fine, you don't really notice. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6747.28s)]
*  Yeah, you only notice the cracks when the economy is rough. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6749.12s)]
*  I think we would have after 9-11 if they didn't expose the weapons of mass destruction stuff. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6751.36s)]
*  If we just went on believing it. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6759.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6760.88s)]
*  The fact that there was this self-reflection going, [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6761.44s)]
*  hey, there were no weapons of mass destruction. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6764.24s)]
*  What we did was fucked up. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6766.0s)]
*  And a bunch of these military companies got rich. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6767.04s)]
*  Because I never saw the country together as one after 9-11. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6769.36s)]
*  Everybody was like, American flags, pro-America, everything. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6774.64s)]
*  Everybody. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6778.4s)]
*  I'm so diabolical. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6779.12s)]
*  Now there's a part of me that's even thinking, the real puppet masters, [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6780.4s)]
*  when there's no actual bad guy for us to fight out there that's threatening, [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6785.76s)]
*  do we create internal bad guys and then rebuke them as a country? [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6790.08s)]
*  Now we're united again. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6797.4400000000005s)]
*  Then a new internal bad guy. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6798.88s)]
*  Rebuke, united. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6800.8s)]
*  So it's like, weapons of mass destruction. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6802.08s)]
*  That's bullshit. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6804.64s)]
*  We're all coming down and we got that bad guy out of here. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6805.52s)]
*  And now we're heroes of our own story without needing a Hitler, [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6808.0s)]
*  or without needing a Mussolini, or without needing a Stalin. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6813.76s)]
*  Was Stalin? [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6817.120000000001s)]
*  Weren't we kind of aligned, though, with Stalin? [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6818.72s)]
*  I mean, in World War II, but then the second the war ended. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6820.72s)]
*  He was the threat of communism. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6823.76s)]
*  But I wonder if you're doing next level, what is that, country craft? [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6825.84s)]
*  Yeah, state craft. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6832.96s)]
*  State craft. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6833.84s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6834.64s)]
*  That's kind of scary. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6836.0s)]
*  But that's probably the conversations they have. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6839.2s)]
*  They're like, yeah, we got 350 million people. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6840.8s)]
*  How do we get these people to just chill the fuck out? [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6842.4s)]
*  And then kind of like the movie studio thing, [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6845.679999999999s)]
*  you probably have real people that have like real honest opinions that we need to do this. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6847.44s)]
*  And then you have the people at the top, maybe, that are like, [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6851.28s)]
*  yeah, we just need to keep the money coming in, keep everything moving economically. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6854.4s)]
*  And then they kind of team up, push an ideology, [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6857.84s)]
*  and they're like, yeah, we can become number one with this. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6859.84s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6863.44s)]
*  Okay, tell me the rat thing. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6864.16s)]
*  Here's the shortest version. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6865.28s)]
*  Universe 25. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6866.639999999999s)]
*  You ever heard of this? [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6867.36s)]
*  No. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6868.08s)]
*  This is an experiment that this guy did in the United States, the guy John Calhoun. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6868.48s)]
*  And he was a researcher at the National Institute of Health. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6872.16s)]
*  And basically, he was doing these rat experiments where he was trying to see [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6874.8s)]
*  basically the effects of urbanization. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6877.5199999999995s)]
*  So like post-World War II, you have these cities propping up all over the country. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6879.76s)]
*  They're like expanding. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6882.48s)]
*  You got New York, Chicago, LA. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6883.599999999999s)]
*  They're becoming these massive hubs where people are living in these small, tiny little apartments. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6885.44s)]
*  And basically, he was doing these rat experiments to see if you had all your resources met, [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6888.639999999999s)]
*  you had food, you had housing, all that stuff just by overpopulation would lead to social decay. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6892.16s)]
*  And so he takes- [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6897.2s)]
*  So real quick, because I think it's really important. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6897.92s)]
*  There's enough food. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6902.24s)]
*  There's enough shelter. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6903.92s)]
*  Okay, so you are met with everything you need or we thought that you needed to thrive. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6905.68s)]
*  So he creates what he calls the rat utopia or the mouse utopia, where it's 10 square feet [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6911.76s)]
*  and they have all the food possible. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6917.04s)]
*  They have all these compartments. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6918.8s)]
*  It has a holding capacity of 3,000 mice. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6919.84s)]
*  He drops eight of them in there with robust DNA that they can procreate effectively. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6922.08s)]
*  And for 100 days, they just start banging, just mouse sex everywhere. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6926.64s)]
*  They have a bunch of kids. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6931.5199999999995s)]
*  And then slowly, things start to decline. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6932.72s)]
*  So around two years in, it's like a 600 day, it's like a five-year experiment. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6936.0s)]
*  They're all helping each other. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6940.48s)]
*  They're living great. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6941.5199999999995s)]
*  Everybody's happy. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6943.04s)]
*  And everyone's cooperating. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6943.76s)]
*  So the mother's taking care of the kids. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6944.8s)]
*  The males are protecting their families, da-da-da. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6946.88s)]
*  And then at a certain point, out of like a thousand rats or a thousand mice, [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6950.0s)]
*  it starts to fall apart where now there's conflict around these high traffic zones. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6953.92s)]
*  So whenever the mice are coming into contact to each other, they're hyper aggressive. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6959.04s)]
*  And then the female mice are not protecting their young. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6962.96s)]
*  And then they start getting into cannibalism. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6965.76s)]
*  And the mice are actually eating each other. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6967.84s)]
*  When they don't have to, there's enough food. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6969.52s)]
*  There's enough food. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6970.88s)]
*  Oh, even when the population grew, they just kept the food at a level where everybody... [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6971.52s)]
*  There's enough food for every mouse. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6976.08s)]
*  So every time a new mouse is born, they inject more food, more food, more food. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6977.36s)]
*  So everyone has enough food. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6980.08s)]
*  But they're still fighting. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6981.36s)]
*  And they're still fighting. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6982.24s)]
*  And then they're creating... [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6983.28s)]
*  Tribalizing, right? [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6984.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6985.2s)]
*  And they have all their different compartments. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6985.759999999999s)]
*  They can all spread out. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6987.36s)]
*  And then at these food centers, these like high traffic zones, they start to get aggressive. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6988.5599999999995s)]
*  And then it goes even further. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6994.08s)]
*  Once they get to like 2,000, the birth rate starts to drop. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6995.679999999999s)]
*  They stop procreating. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6998.639999999999s)]
*  Mothers stop protecting their kids. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=6999.759999999999s)]
*  At certain parts of it, there's a 90% mortality rate of young [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7001.5199999999995s)]
*  because mothers are not protecting their kids. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7004.639999999999s)]
*  And so then you have hyperaggression from the males, lack of maternalism from the females. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7006.56s)]
*  And then the most interesting part is that you get some of the mice that become socially detached. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7010.96s)]
*  So he calls it in the experiment, the beautiful ones. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7015.280000000001s)]
*  And there's an interesting parallel with Japan. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7017.68s)]
*  So the beautiful ones in the experiment are these mice that basically just checked out. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7020.240000000001s)]
*  They had food, they would go in their little compartments, and they would just groom themselves [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7024.400000000001s)]
*  like neurotically. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7027.92s)]
*  And they were pristine. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7029.04s)]
*  They were like the most beautiful mice of the whole thing. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7029.84s)]
*  Some of them were like chewed up and eaten up and battles and stuff. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7031.52s)]
*  These ones were just fully detached. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7034.64s)]
*  They had nothing to do with the society. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7036.8s)]
*  Now there's a thing happening in Japan right now, the hokimori, if you can look it up. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7038.639999999999s)]
*  And basically it's a group of people in Japan that have kind of like dubbed themselves these [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7043.44s)]
*  detached people of society that don't really participate. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7046.96s)]
*  They get some assistance from the government and they just kind of live in their houses [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7050.16s)]
*  and they don't really go out. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7053.04s)]
*  And they are completely isolated from any type of community. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7054.08s)]
*  And as a result, yeah, the hikikomori. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7057.84s)]
*  Yeah, hikikomori. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7061.679999999999s)]
*  And they just leave in extreme isolation. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7062.48s)]
*  And people pointed to this and be like, this is basically the beautiful ones of the experiment. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7064.64s)]
*  They just kind of detached fully from society. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7068.240000000001s)]
*  But I would also imagine that the birthrate decline mirrors the decline of birthrates [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7070.400000000001s)]
*  in urban centers. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7076.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7077.280000000001s)]
*  What people have said. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7078.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7079.12s)]
*  The violence. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7079.76s)]
*  It's like, it's not like, and again, I can't speak for everyone in New York, but it's not [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7080.96s)]
*  like people, like I see fat homeless people here. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7084.240000000001s)]
*  You know, like there's food here, there's food centers. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7086.4800000000005s)]
*  It's not like there's starvation happening. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7089.4400000000005s)]
*  Yes, there are people that are worried about their next meal. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7090.96s)]
*  But it's different than in third world countries. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7093.36s)]
*  Let's put it that way. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7096.32s)]
*  And there is access to resources if you need it here. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7097.12s)]
*  Yes. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7099.839999999999s)]
*  So but you still see this like reduction in birthrate. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7100.48s)]
*  You still see the tribalism. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7105.12s)]
*  You still see hyperaggression. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7106.799999999999s)]
*  Hyperaggression. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7108.32s)]
*  And it's funny that like it's not about resources. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7109.679999999999s)]
*  It could be simply about proximity and how humans interact with one another. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7113.12s)]
*  When there's too many of us in too small space. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7118.32s)]
*  We're not just fighting over fucking gold or water or food. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7121.120000000001s)]
*  It's simply we're not supposed to be around each other like this. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7124.160000000001s)]
*  It could literally be that. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7128.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7129.92s)]
*  And so the eventual conclusion of the experiment, it didn't even get to the holding [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7130.320000000001s)]
*  capacity. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7132.88s)]
*  It got to like 2300, 2400. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7133.120000000001s)]
*  And then the numbers started going down. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7135.360000000001s)]
*  They stopped reproducing until eventually the whole society just fell out. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7137.04s)]
*  They call it behavioral sink. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7139.84s)]
*  Behavioral sink is just the whole thing. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7142.160000000001s)]
*  Basically, it's like crash down. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7143.52s)]
*  And the interesting part is they took some of the mice out and put them into normal [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7144.72s)]
*  enclosures. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7147.92s)]
*  And even the mice that they took out never adapted to the new enclosures. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7148.64s)]
*  They continue to have aggressive tendencies or non-maternalistic tendencies. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7152.88s)]
*  And so they still had the maladaptive behavior from the original experiment. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7156.080000000001s)]
*  And then the kids of the mice with maladaptive behaviors continued to have [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7159.360000000001s)]
*  hyperaggressive tendencies. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7164.0s)]
*  And so there was like an epigenetic problem within the mice where they could prolong [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7165.360000000001s)]
*  the effects. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7169.04s)]
*  This is actually something we could we should talk to Atiya about with the epigenetic [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7169.92s)]
*  effects, like where you could potentially pass on trauma. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7175.04s)]
*  This is really interesting. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7178.96s)]
*  Women are born with all the eggs that they'll have throughout their menstrual cycles. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7182.4s)]
*  Therefore, they're less susceptible to epigenetic factors, meaning like whatever's [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7186.72s)]
*  happening in your environment and how it influences you, what you pass on. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7192.4800000000005s)]
*  Since they're born with all the eggs that they'll have, it's harder to transform those [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7196.8s)]
*  eggs and then pass on those genetic differences. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7202.08s)]
*  What essentially is happening is all of evolution is happening through sperm. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7205.36s)]
*  So the things that happen to the male, remember, we reproduce sperm every five days [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7211.12s)]
*  or whatever it is. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7215.36s)]
*  Like you bust a few loads and then you continue having. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7216.08s)]
*  So the things that are happening to in your life, their impact in your life, the food [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7218.24s)]
*  that you're eating, the environments you're in, the things you're experiencing, you could [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7222.32s)]
*  say it is passed through to your young through the male because that sperm can be manipulated [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7226.0s)]
*  by the microplastics or all these other things that are happening in the world. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7232.64s)]
*  Kind of interesting that like evolution is dependent on the man. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7235.92s)]
*  It is happening to women just at a much slower rate. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7242.320000000001s)]
*  Not saying that these things aren't affecting them. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7245.360000000001s)]
*  They 100% are, but they're not changing the eggs in real time. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7247.6s)]
*  Whereas like the sperm can be changed like months by month. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7253.04s)]
*  It's just kind of a crazy thing. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7257.68s)]
*  Like, I don't know if this works, but like you go into war and coming back and carrying [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7260.16s)]
*  that trauma. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7263.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't know how that affects your sperm. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7263.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7265.44s)]
*  But if there is some sort of societal or environmental effect on your sperm and it could [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7266.0s)]
*  impact it, like, is there a point where you go, I think you got to hold off five years [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7272.4s)]
*  so you can work through this stuff that's in your body. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7278.48s)]
*  Like you were exposed to this thing in at war. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7280.719999999999s)]
*  It could be Agent Orange or whatever like that. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7283.36s)]
*  That's going to be in your sperm. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7285.5199999999995s)]
*  Or you were addicted to heroin for X amount of years. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7286.96s)]
*  You need to flush whatever you got out before that same thing gets passed on. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7289.360000000001s)]
*  I don't know if the research has been done to that level, but it's kind of cool to think [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7293.52s)]
*  about. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7297.28s)]
*  Yeah, I've even read some stuff like epigenetics. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7297.4400000000005s)]
*  Again, this might be pseudoscience. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7299.6s)]
*  But epigenetics is environment, right? [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7301.2s)]
*  It's just like... [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7304.96s)]
*  Epigenetics, as I understood it, is like basically passing on genes and having traits in your [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7305.52s)]
*  young that are environmental from the parents. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7312.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7314.64s)]
*  So it's basically like if the parents experience something, it's possible to genetically pass [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7315.2s)]
*  it on. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7319.04s)]
*  That's just what I want to clarify. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7319.12s)]
*  But like through like emotional shit or like high stress environments, like high anxiety [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7320.96s)]
*  parents having children in high anxiety times could create high anxiety children, even if [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7325.76s)]
*  they're no longer anxious or raised in a non-anxious environment. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7329.76s)]
*  I don't know necessarily what the data is on the current science, but I've heard these. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7332.96s)]
*  This is the cool stuff to learn about, though. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7335.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we should talk to it about it. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7337.679999999999s)]
*  Just one thing on the rat experiment. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7339.44s)]
*  I feel like people in condensed areas tend to be a bit more open-minded and liberal towards [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7341.92s)]
*  other people because of the close confluence. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7350.16s)]
*  Isn't that like going against what happened in that experiment? [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7353.599999999999s)]
*  Critics of the experiment would be like a few things. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7358.48s)]
*  One, humans are mice. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7360.4s)]
*  That's the opposite one. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7361.839999999999s)]
*  Like they don't have the consciousness or like the ability to like discern threat or not. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7362.639999999999s)]
*  They just kind of acting on it. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7366.96s)]
*  Probably have lower capacity to change intellectualized situations. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7367.84s)]
*  And then additionally, people said that this is not a utopia. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7371.28s)]
*  He called it a rat utopia. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7375.04s)]
*  There's high density channels where people are bumping into each other. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7376.96s)]
*  There's intentional conflict on these frequency corridors where, one, if you can build an urban [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7380.72s)]
*  design well enough, you can decrease that. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7386.400000000001s)]
*  And two, in the wild mice, when they're experiencing a threat, they're going to run. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7388.24s)]
*  They're not going to fight. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7391.28s)]
*  And if you have no place to run. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7392.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7393.2s)]
*  They're fighting because they're in an enclosure. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7393.6s)]
*  Gotcha. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7395.04s)]
*  That's a good point. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7395.52s)]
*  You can leave a city. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7397.2s)]
*  You can run away from a conflict. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7398.5599999999995s)]
*  Things like that. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7399.84s)]
*  To wrap this up, it's like a jail. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7400.72s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7402.72s)]
*  More so. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7403.22s)]
*  Nicely ran jail. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7404.08s)]
*  But as a result, policymakers have taken the experiment and applied it to theme park design, [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7404.8s)]
*  jails, all that kind of stuff. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7409.04s)]
*  Smart. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7410.0s)]
*  Where they're like, okay, in the experiment, there's only four zones where they can get [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7410.4s)]
*  food. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7414.24s)]
*  Something like that. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7414.88s)]
*  And now they're like disperse it, put it all over. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7415.599999999999s)]
*  So now theme parks will have food, like tiny little 50 person stands all over rather than [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7418.0s)]
*  one giant spot where everyone can get food because they're trying to lower contact. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7423.6s)]
*  I would also say another criticism of the experiment and why you can't exactly compare [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7427.84s)]
*  it to the urban centers in America is that, and maybe this is why the urban centers continue [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7433.120000000001s)]
*  to thrive, is because people move here. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7438.4800000000005s)]
*  If it was just us, it would fall apart. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7441.76s)]
*  I genuinely believe that. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7445.92s)]
*  And I think a lot of us end up moving out. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7447.280000000001s)]
*  A lot of my friends that grew up in New York have just moved. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7450.160000000001s)]
*  They went to the suburbs. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7452.56s)]
*  They don't go too far, but they get out of it. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7453.52s)]
*  They get out of the rat race. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7455.68s)]
*  And like even like, you know, I mean, your sister went to Philly. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7457.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7461.280000000001s)]
*  But ever since she was young, she never liked being around people. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7461.6s)]
*  Like she was a suburban person. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7465.6s)]
*  Right. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7467.6s)]
*  I mean, you guys grew up in a beach community, so there is a bit. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7467.84s)]
*  I get that. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7470.160000000001s)]
*  I get it. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7471.68s)]
*  She's probably searching for that. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7472.240000000001s)]
*  But in all seriousness, I think that what allows these urban centers to continue this [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7473.200000000001s)]
*  inorganic way of living is this influx of new people hopping on to the American dream. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7480.08s)]
*  And I don't know if it was just us. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7486.0s)]
*  Like I think about this a lot. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7488.719999999999s)]
*  Like we're used to it and we're accustomed to it, but it is unnatural. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7490.0s)]
*  Well, then you look at Japan, you're like, okay, very low immigration, very low emigration. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7493.759999999999s)]
*  And what's happening? [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7497.599999999999s)]
*  And now are you experiencing societal collapse? [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7498.32s)]
*  Are they having the super low birth rate? [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7500.16s)]
*  Are they having this social detachment? [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7501.679999999999s)]
*  And they are, right? [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7503.12s)]
*  That's what people would say. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7504.08s)]
*  And what is the eventual fallout of that? [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7505.5199999999995s)]
*  What is the conclusion of that? [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7507.28s)]
*  According to these experiments, not great. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7508.48s)]
*  Yes, just send some Mexicans, man. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7511.44s)]
*  Yeah, we love you all. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7514.24s)]
*  We appreciate you, man. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7515.12s)]
*  And we're going to see you next week. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7516.4s)]
*  Peace. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCGbLXu7nA&t=7518.24s)]
