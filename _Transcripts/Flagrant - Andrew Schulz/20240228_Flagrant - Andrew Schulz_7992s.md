*  They used to call us fat fucks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=0.0s)]
*  My friend's mother, Barbara. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1.76s)]
*  How old are you? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3.1s)]
*  14. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3.94s)]
*  She wrote down the window of her Saturn. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4.76s)]
*  She was smoking a cigarette and she'd go, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  where are you fat fucks going? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=9.06s)]
*  It really exposes the lie of the Woodstock generation. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=10.8s)]
*  We see them as this progressive, free-loving gent. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=16.52s)]
*  They were just selfish drug addicts. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=18.94s)]
*  I think Obama is probably bisexual. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=20.44s)]
*  And the Tucker went around Moscow [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=22.88s)]
*  making YouTube videos. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=24.42s)]
*  It's weird to be a 50-year-old YouTuber. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=25.76s)]
*  He's making Nelk Boy style videos in a grocery store. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=29.12s)]
*  I think it's a great story. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=32.48s)]
*  I think people are supporting Shane. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  He did an amazing job. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=35.2s)]
*  If the boomers can be explained in one sentence, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=36.68s)]
*  it's a woman sitting down drinking a coffee [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=40.16s)]
*  going, the Irish were slaves, too. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=42.64s)]
*  What's up, everybody? Welcome to Flaygr. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  Today we are joined by an illustrious guest. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=47.2s)]
*  It's amazing that he's even here right now. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=50.56s)]
*  There's been a tragic death in the family. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  Lord Jacob Rothschild has died, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=55.2s)]
*  but Tim Dillon is still here. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  How? How did you pull through? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=59.279999999999994s)]
*  Well, when someone has an impact on you, as he did, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=61.559999999999995s)]
*  he made a huge impact on me and my family. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=65.12s)]
*  You want them to be at peace. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=69.6s)]
*  And he suffered a long time. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=71.47999999999999s)]
*  Like 87 years of suffering. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=76.4s)]
*  It was 87 years, and he finally escaped his human form. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=82.56s)]
*  Transcended. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=83.4s)]
*  He went back to the core of the earth where he lives. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=84.8s)]
*  You think he went down? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=89.8s)]
*  I think he's in the center. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=90.64s)]
*  I think I spent some time in the center [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=91.83999999999999s)]
*  to just kind of work things out. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=94.24s)]
*  Yeah, work things out. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=96.24s)]
*  So not straight up. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=97.91999999999999s)]
*  He's not going straight up. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  No, I don't know if he's going up at all. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=99.91999999999999s)]
*  I don't know if he wants to be up. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=101.56s)]
*  I don't know if he wants to be up, no. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=103.24s)]
*  The family reunion's downstairs. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's in the core. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=106.56s)]
*  There's a molten core where Lord Jacob Rothschild [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=107.88s)]
*  is just kind of sitting there now. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=110.44s)]
*  Who is this guy? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=113.2s)]
*  Very wealthy member of one of the most famous [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=114.88000000000001s)]
*  and talked about families of all time. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=119.72s)]
*  But was he like a major player? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=124.36s)]
*  Was he just a trust fund kid? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=125.8s)]
*  He's a player. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  You know, I mean, they're very, very good [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=128.16s)]
*  at keeping their name kind of out of the press. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=130.44s)]
*  So I mean, what he did or didn't do [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=133.24s)]
*  or how powerful any people are in that family, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=136.84s)]
*  you kind of have to guess because there's a lot of websites [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=142.12s)]
*  that will tell you that everything, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=146.04s)]
*  every stoplight is them. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=147.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=149.04s)]
*  That's going on in the weather. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=149.88s)]
*  All in Taylor Swift and the Super Bowl and all of it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=151.88s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure it just, because a lot of it is silly, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=155.28s)]
*  but they are incredibly powerful [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=158.96s)]
*  and they're very good at keeping themselves [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  kind of in the background of the photo. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=162.56s)]
*  So in the photo, there's like people that we all know [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=164.64000000000001s)]
*  and the leaders of countries and everything. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=167.96s)]
*  And in the background, it's kind of, you know, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=169.56s)]
*  they're off to the side, but they're there. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=171.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=173.2s)]
*  They're hanging. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=174.04s)]
*  They're interesting. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=174.88s)]
*  Tim, I'm really excited you're here [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=175.72s)]
*  because I feel like there is a problem. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=177.36s)]
*  And I feel like... [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=179.28s)]
*  With the Rothschilds. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=180.4s)]

*  It's that like, I feel now, more than any time in history, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=186.6s)]
*  there's been a lot of negativity [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  towards the 1% and the billionaire. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=192.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=194.0s)]

*  One billion dollars. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=258.28s)]
*  Billion dollars. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=259.12s)]
*  By the way, and here's why it's too much. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=259.96s)]
*  It's for his mother. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=260.8s)]
*  What? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=261.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=262.48s)]
*  He thought he was gonna get away with it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=263.32s)]
*  That shit's just dead, sir. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=265.44s)]
*  He's moving right in. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=267.0s)]
*  It's too much to say those words. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=267.84s)]
*  I'm spending a billion dollars [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=270.0s)]
*  to build the most expensive house in the world. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=271.92s)]
*  And then it's all for mom. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=274.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=275.48s)]
*  That is gonna get people. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=276.32s)]
*  Did he think that that was a good enough shield [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=277.92s)]
*  to protect him from the harassment? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=279.84s)]
*  I think he was trying to sound sweet. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=281.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=284.24s)]
*  If you had this, wouldn't you build [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=286.0s)]
*  a billion dollar house for his mother? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=287.68s)]
*  Let's just answer that question right here. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=289.2s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=290.44s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=291.92s)]
*  But for your dad. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=293.0s)]
*  You guys gotta love your mother. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=294.36s)]
*  Are you spending a billion dollars? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=296.12s)]
*  My mother would ruin a billion dollar house [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=297.92s)]
*  with Hestrox and Beanie Babies. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=299.92s)]
*  Collectable, the worst. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=301.92s)]
*  My mother would, anything I bought her, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=304.56s)]
*  she would destroy it with knickknacks and chotch keys. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=306.28s)]
*  That's the reason. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=309.96s)]
*  Oh, the worst. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=310.8s)]
*  She's just gonna ruin it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=311.96s)]
*  Snow globe she stole from a hotel in Vegas. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=312.8s)]
*  And now, littered all over a Palm Beach. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=316.08s)]
*  Fuck these hoodies. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=317.88s)]
*  So you think the billionaires are going too far. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=319.0s)]
*  They're flexing on the gram a little bit. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=320.55999999999995s)]
*  If it was 900 million, that's not a problem. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=322.2s)]
*  I think it's, I think actually, maybe almost, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=324.55999999999995s)]
*  because that B is a line in the sand. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=327.91999999999996s)]
*  It's saying like, I think he wants one bill. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=331.84s)]
*  He's doing it, it's one billion dollars. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=334.91999999999996s)]
*  It is a billion dollars. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=336.91999999999996s)]
*  It's a billion dollars. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=337.76s)]
*  So that, in and of itself, makes people go, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=338.58s)]
*  it's like that first episode of Billions [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=340.67999999999995s)]
*  where they tell Bobby Oxrad, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=343.0s)]
*  he goes, just don't buy the house. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=344.56s)]
*  And he's like, I'm buying it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=345.76s)]
*  And he goes, I'm gonna buy the house. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=346.59999999999997s)]
*  So I get it, somebody told him. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=347.41999999999996s)]
*  Somebody went to him and went, hey, don't do it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=349.03999999999996s)]
*  There's a few billionaires talk. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=352.0s)]
*  And they're like, hey man, I get it. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=353.96s)]
*  I get it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=356.52s)]
*  He already owns the most expensive apartment [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=357.35999999999996s)]
*  in New York City. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=358.96s)]
*  He was the Wall Street bets guy, right? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=359.79999999999995s)]
*  That they were betting against, was that him? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=361.52s)]
*  He was one of them. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=362.96s)]
*  He was the guy who, I think Citadel owned Robinhood. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=363.79999999999995s)]
*  And he was using the data from Robinhood [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=367.2s)]
*  to make trades at his hedge fund Citadel. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=370.4s)]
*  He was like beating the trades that he was taking. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=373.44s)]
*  It's kind of a genius fucking thing to do, but. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=376.47999999999996s)]
*  He's a smart guy. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=378.08s)]
*  But I think a few people were probably like, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=378.91999999999996s)]
*  hey man, don't do this. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=380.52s)]
*  It's a billion dollars for a single family house. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=382.84s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=387.96s)]
*  On an island where the average price of a house [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=389.12s)]
*  is probably north of 10, 15 million, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=391.71999999999997s)]
*  meaning these are all very rich people already [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=394.67999999999995s)]
*  and you're being gross. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=398.96s)]
*  They're looking at you like you're an asshole. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=400.92s)]
*  Do you know how, like, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=403.48s)]
*  because every time we hang out, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=404.56s)]
*  you'll tell me a hilarious story about these people [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=406.40000000000003s)]
*  you've collected in your life. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=408.64000000000004s)]
*  You have an absolutely mind boggling friend group. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=410.28000000000003s)]

*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=418.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=419.56s)]
*  So when you're interacting with some of these people, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=421.24s)]
*  are you, are they like expecting you [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=424.84000000000003s)]
*  to keep it real with them? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=427.04s)]
*  Are you brought there to be like, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=428.36s)]

*  What do you mean? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=432.96s)]
*  Never, ever, ever, ever. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=433.79999999999995s)]
*  So you go right along with it all and you, it's. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=434.88s)]
*  The most fun thing about a lot of people in my life [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=437.2s)]
*  is that they're mentally ill. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=439.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=441.23999999999995s)]
*  And many of them. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=442.2s)]
*  Is that your comfort zone? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=443.03999999999996s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=443.88s)]

*  and my mother was crazy when I grew up. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=445.56s)]

*  It defeats the purpose. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=451.4s)]
*  You, it's not fun, it's actually not fun. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=452.96s)]
*  You want the roller coaster. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=455.4s)]
*  Imagine hanging out with Donald Trump and going like, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=456.24s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=464.2s)]
*  You're just along for the ride. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=465.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=466.0s)]

*  and you've gotta get off the ride. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=469.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=470.84000000000003s)]
*  When does that happen? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=471.68s)]
*  Well, things can turn dark. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=473.44s)]

*  These people in the Capitol are there, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=574.36s)]

*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=584.0s)]
*  But if we're just looking at degree of fun, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=584.84s)]
*  white people know how to do it. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=587.08s)]
*  They seem like they're having a lot of fun. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=588.12s)]
*  Like Martin. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=590.32s)]
*  Because they believe they're not gonna get in trouble. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=591.16s)]
*  Why would they? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=593.6s)]
*  They go, this is my country, it's my country. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=594.44s)]
*  That was their thought process. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=596.88s)]
*  They're like, this is my country. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=597.92s)]

*  It's my Congresswoman, why can't I chase her? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=606.36s)]
*  We need to have more entitlements. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=608.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=609.72s)]

*  No way. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=613.04s)]
*  She was, at Radio City. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=613.88s)]
*  I thought that was Lisa Ann that got kicked out. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=614.72s)]
*  No, it was AOC on her. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=615.92s)]
*  It was AOC? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=617.3199999999999s)]
*  Get out of here. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=618.16s)]
*  But no, she was at a Matt Rife show. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=619.6s)]
*  And how'd it go? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=620.92s)]
*  At Radio City. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=621.74s)]
*  You think he took that down? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=622.5799999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=624.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, she dates some pasty bearded dude. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=625.28s)]
*  Matt Rife, step up. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=628.8s)]
*  For sure, but I think that's part of the leftist cred. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=630.36s)]
*  Which is? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=633.44s)]
*  Dating a pasty bearded guy. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=634.36s)]
*  Dating down. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=636.7600000000001s)]
*  Dating a guy who is intellectually exciting [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=637.6800000000001s)]
*  to your group. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=642.84s)]
*  Oh, see, I would think she needs to go, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=644.8800000000001s)]
*  because everything is on some hierarchy [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=647.0s)]
*  of socioeconomic perception or whatever, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=649.0400000000001s)]
*  so I would think she needs to date a black dude [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=651.4200000000001s)]
*  who transitioned. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=654.22s)]
*  No. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=655.1600000000001s)]
*  She's into like- [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=656.0s)]
*  She's minority enough. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=656.82s)]
*  She's minority enough. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=658.22s)]
*  Exactly, so now she just dates this guy [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=659.2s)]
*  who rewards her ideas. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=661.1s)]
*  Brooklyn Socialist, PBR, that's every comic [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=662.68s)]
*  from 2008 to 2015. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=667.16s)]
*  That's every comedian that was on television, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=670.9599999999999s)]
*  that was doing a show in Brooklyn, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=673.68s)]
*  that would get up and do a joke [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=675.56s)]
*  about his parents being racist. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=676.8s)]
*  That's bootleg Prince Harry right there. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=678.12s)]
*  She's just going through- [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=680.1999999999999s)]
*  This guy just finished a set of UCB Gut Bucket. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=681.04s)]
*  Yeah, right, right. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=683.4399999999999s)]
*  Okay, so AOC, I mean, the Democrats basically told her [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=685.1999999999999s)]
*  to be quiet, right? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=688.3599999999999s)]
*  She's been real. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=689.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, they got a real issue with the Israel Gaza thing, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=690.44s)]
*  and I think they're just trying to, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=693.2800000000001s)]
*  it's like a company where they're trying to get everyone [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=695.6s)]
*  on the same page and it's like getting a call, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=697.48s)]
*  and they're like, hey everybody, we could break room. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=699.5600000000001s)]
*  If you've ever worked at a company where they're like, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=702.4000000000001s)]
*  that article came out about us, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=704.8800000000001s)]
*  and we have challenges, but, I won't touch the mic again. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=706.72s)]
*  We have challenges, but we're gonna overcome them together, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=711.5600000000001s)]
*  and what we need everybody to do is just all those things. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=715.72s)]
*  And then we'll be like, it's all hands on deck. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=719.24s)]
*  We're just all gonna give it, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=721.76s)]
*  so I think that's what the Democrats are doing. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=723.5200000000001s)]
*  They're trying to control- [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=725.12s)]
*  Narrative. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=727.48s)]
*  Their narrative and the voting base is kind of- [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=728.32s)]
*  A little fractured. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=731.96s)]
*  Fractured big time, they're really fractured. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=732.8000000000001s)]
*  So I think the whole convention I set on my show [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=735.2s)]
*  has to just be songs and no talking. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=737.4000000000001s)]
*  Hill song, they just gotta go Christian church. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=740.84s)]
*  Whatever it is, they have to just do a big musical review, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=743.88s)]
*  and then every time somebody goes, free Palestine, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=749.16s)]
*  you go, boo, and then they just, people come out. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=751.88s)]
*  Get into song. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=753.96s)]
*  Guitars, drums, because you're not gonna get everyone [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=754.8s)]
*  on the same page, you have to distract people [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=758.28s)]
*  from this question. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=761.08s)]
*  Here's a thing that I've seen popping up, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=762.64s)]
*  and I didn't expect this, that now people are attacking [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=763.96s)]
*  Biden for having too much hubris. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=766.96s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=769.56s)]
*  You haven't seen this at all? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=770.4s)]
*  They're like, he refuses to step down. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=771.4s)]
*  It's his ego, his arrogance. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=773.68s)]
*  I don't think he wants to be there at all. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=776.28s)]
*  I think he's a boomer, and he's an old guy. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=778.36s)]
*  He's maybe even older than a boomer. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=782.0400000000001s)]
*  He's definitely older than a boomer. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=783.24s)]
*  But it's just part of that ethos of like, he doesn't, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=785.08s)]
*  I don't think, he's like half in, half out. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=789.76s)]
*  I don't think he's ever done anything. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=793.24s)]
*  Yeah, I think he's just kinda there, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=794.4000000000001s)]
*  and I think the wife and the people around him [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=796.44s)]
*  are using him, and I think they don't wanna step down. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=798.64s)]
*  The people that are using Biden. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=802.2s)]
*  So Handlers don't want. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=803.6800000000001s)]
*  The Wizard of Oz behind Biden. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=805.3199999999999s)]
*  Is whom? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=808.56s)]
*  That's making the things go, and his hands go, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=809.4s)]
*  and the puppeteers, they don't want it. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=812.4s)]
*  Shitty puppeteer for as much as Biden falls. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=814.76s)]
*  It's not Biden, it's the people behind him [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=816.04s)]
*  that don't want to step down. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=818.28s)]
*  But who are they? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=819.12s)]
*  These are people that, you know. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=819.9599999999999s)]
*  That DNC? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=821.8s)]
*  Well, maybe it's part of DNC, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=823.4399999999999s)]
*  but I think it's a lot of people like Tony Blinken [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=825.4s)]
*  at the State Department, Victoria Nuland [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=828.8s)]
*  at the State Department, the people whose world view [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=830.68s)]
*  is kind of front and center right now. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=834.04s)]
*  And I think those people like the idea [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=836.16s)]
*  that Biden is kind of doing everything they want [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=838.64s)]
*  in the Ukraine and Israel and places like that. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=840.96s)]
*  And I think they don't. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=843.4s)]
*  And no pushback at all. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=845.24s)]
*  None. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=846.08s)]
*  So I think they don't want. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=846.92s)]
*  They really don't want to leave the stage, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=848.64s)]
*  and then the people, of course, behind them [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=850.88s)]
*  don't want them to leave and all of that. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=852.6s)]
*  Okay, so you have him locked in. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=854.2s)]
*  All right, so then what happens with the election? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=855.64s)]
*  You think Biden goes through with it? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=857.76s)]
*  I think they yank him in May. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=858.92s)]
*  I'm gonna make a prediction. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=860.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=861.52s)]
*  Really, yeah. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=862.36s)]
*  I'm making a prediction right now. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=863.24s)]
*  And I think they run Michelle Obama as Big Mike. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=864.96s)]
*  Big Mike! [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=868.4000000000001s)]
*  As a man. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=869.24s)]
*  Big Mike is back! [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=870.08s)]

*  Big Mike is back. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=877.9200000000001s)]
*  It dominates the news. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=878.96s)]
*  Trump can't get any coverage. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=880.0400000000001s)]
*  He's screaming. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=881.8000000000001s)]
*  He's crying. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=882.88s)]
*  He's screaming. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=883.72s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=887.12s)]
*  There's only one way. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=887.96s)]
*  He's drinking a fucking, what is it, a matcha latte? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=888.8000000000001s)]

*  You have no choice. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=895.76s)]
*  You gotta run Big Mike. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=896.5999999999999s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=898.4399999999999s)]
*  I did a slip up there. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=899.28s)]
*  I did a little something. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=900.68s)]

*  I don't think she wants to do it. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=920.4s)]
*  I think they've approached her multiple times. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=921.88s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=923.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't think she wants to do it. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=924.4s)]

*  until she succumbs? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=927.28s)]
*  I think. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=929.44s)]
*  I mean, they killed the paddle boarder, right? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=930.28s)]
*  I think he was, I've always believed. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=931.8s)]
*  Yeah, what have you always believed? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=934.36s)]
*  I think Obama is probably bisexual. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=935.8s)]
*  I think the paddle boarder is a really hot, ripped chef. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=938.72s)]
*  I'm just saying, if I was a ripped paddle boarder [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=942.32s)]
*  and was kind of reportedly writing a book. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=946.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=948.88s)]
*  I might have been loosely based on. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=949.72s)]
*  Smoking out your husband. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=951.2s)]
*  You know, maybe I would also drown in two feet of water. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=952.32s)]
*  Two feet outside of my boss's estate, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=955.84s)]
*  which I was using when he wasn't home, which never. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=958.32s)]
*  That's kind of weird that your chef would do that. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=960.72s)]
*  Gotta be really close to your chef. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=962.96s)]
*  Does your maid call you and go, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=963.8000000000001s)]

*  I'm in Abu Dhabi, get in there. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=973.88s)]
*  It's interesting that he's using the estate [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=976.48s)]
*  when he's not there. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=978.92s)]

*  And he dies. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=980.6s)]
*  I'm not saying, I just think maybe sometimes. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=981.4399999999999s)]
*  If you're gonna use the estate and write a book [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=983.8s)]
*  about how you're fucking me, you deserve to die. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=985.72s)]
*  Maybe that's what happens. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=988.12s)]
*  That's too much. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=988.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=989.8s)]
*  But isn't that too much? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=990.64s)]
*  It might be. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=991.46s)]
*  Like if you're gonna, well that's not beard. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=992.3s)]
*  Beard is when. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=994.4399999999999s)]
*  Beard is when it's the woman who's pretending she is. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=995.72s)]
*  Oh, they also, if you were gonna kill him, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=997.6s)]
*  wouldn't you wait until he's somewhere else? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=999.3199999999999s)]
*  Like I'm not gonna kill you anywhere near my property. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1001.88s)]
*  They never do, you'd always think that. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1003.68s)]

*  I think they're basically just like. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1013.12s)]
*  We'll kill JFK. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1015.3199999999999s)]
*  You think we can get away with RFK? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1016.16s)]
*  And here's the thing. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1017.28s)]
*  That's where you wanna kill him. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1019.12s)]

*  Because Putin was looking like a darling in our media. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1261.84s)]
*  First of all, Navalny is not that popular in Russia. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1263.6s)]
*  This is the thing. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1265.76s)]
*  He's been gone for many, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1266.6s)]
*  he was arrested when he came back to the country. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1268.2s)]
*  He was in this Arctic prison, this Polar Wolf prison. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1270.92s)]
*  He's not in any position to come out [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1274.92s)]
*  and run an election and defeat Putin. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1277.04s)]
*  He's not a threat in any way. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1279.28s)]
*  In any way. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1280.5600000000002s)]
*  I'm not saying he wasn't killed. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1281.4s)]
*  Navalny's also pissed off every oligarch in Russia, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1282.52s)]
*  by flying drones over their house [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1285.04s)]

*  I don't know what reason Putin had to kill him. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1293.1200000000001s)]
*  That doesn't mean I'm obviously not in the prison, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1296.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1298.98s)]

*  If, and I don't know if the CIA did it either, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1302.68s)]

*  and we said, now's go time, we get rid of him, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1308.1200000000001s)]
*  it makes Putin look like a monster, it unites Europe, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1311.92s)]
*  we can kinda push this aid package through, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1315.1000000000001s)]
*  it would be. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1317.3200000000002s)]
*  That's what I said. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1318.5600000000002s)]
*  Cool. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1319.4s)]
*  I wanna know that they're doing cool things. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1320.28s)]
*  We used to do cool shit. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1322.96s)]
*  We used to do cool stuff. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1324.04s)]
*  Kill foreign leaders, change governments. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1324.88s)]
*  These people are not crying about Navalny. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1327.8000000000002s)]
*  They don't care. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1331.3600000000001s)]
*  Navalny was a brave guy, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1332.72s)]
*  but he was also a guy that started his career [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1334.68s)]
*  writing incredibly negative stuff [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1337.24s)]
*  about Jews and homosexuals. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1339.2s)]
*  You don't say. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1341.24s)]
*  Yeah, he was very like, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1342.52s)]
*  he was a very Russian nationalist guy. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1344.48s)]
*  Then the West started getting interested in him. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1346.4s)]
*  He changed his tune right away, right away. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1348.8400000000001s)]
*  Starts going, no, no, no, no, no, let's stop all of that. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1351.44s)]
*  Then he started espousing a lot of pro-Western stuff. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1355.44s)]
*  Great. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1357.84s)]
*  And he's a grifter a little bit too. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1358.68s)]
*  Well, he wants power. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1361.28s)]
*  His only plan, his only political philosophy [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1362.16s)]
*  was really like, I wanna rule this place. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1364.6s)]
*  I'm gonna be better than that guy. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1367.44s)]
*  Maybe he would've, I don't know. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1370.84s)]
*  What'd you think of, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1372.6399999999999s)]
*  why would Putin even do the Tucker interview? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1374.24s)]
*  What's the chess move there? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1378.96s)]
*  To me, it felt a little desperate. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1380.16s)]
*  No, I think it actually comes from a position of strength. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1382.56s)]
*  He got an incredibly popular American journalist [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1386.36s)]
*  to not only come to Moscow and let him talk for two hours [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1389.92s)]
*  where he dominated the entire interview. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1392.96s)]
*  Dominated. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1394.92s)]
*  And then Tucker went around Moscow [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1397.32s)]
*  making YouTube videos. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1398.8799999999999s)]
*  That was the corniest shit I've ever seen in my life. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1399.92s)]
*  But here's the other thing. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1402.68s)]
*  Look how cheap Cheerios are here. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1403.52s)]
*  It's weird to be a 50-year-old YouTuber in Moscow. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1404.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1411.2s)]
*  Blazing Moscow. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1413.08s)]
*  He's making Melfoy-style videos in a grocery store. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1413.92s)]
*  He's like, look what I could get this sturgeon for. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1417.44s)]
*  Also, small pushback on very powerful journalists. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1419.84s)]
*  My feeling is he, he still has power for sure, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1423.12s)]
*  but he's been a little bit ostracized, excommunicated. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1425.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he's been ostracized for sure, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1427.68s)]
*  but I do think that if we wanna talk about [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1429.92s)]
*  getting attention, Tucker's name still [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1434.36s)]
*  No, he's killing attention. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1436.6s)]
*  He gets attention. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1437.92s)]
*  He would be the only person that they could get, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1439.04s)]
*  that Putin could get. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1441.84s)]
*  No, he's the only person they would allow. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1442.76s)]
*  Putin's not gonna do, I think Putin. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1445.8799999999999s)]
*  Megyn Kelly, I think, was the last one [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1448.8s)]
*  from traditional media. Yeah, I mean, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1450.72s)]
*  I think Putin's only served if he brings in somebody [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1452.08s)]
*  who's kind of more open to his worldview [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1457.24s)]
*  than somebody who's gotta joust with him. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1460.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1463.24s)]
*  So I think it was kind of a smart move. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1464.08s)]
*  And if you watched the whole interview, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1466.04s)]
*  Putin, Dominic doesn't care about, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1468.8799999999999s)]
*  this is very interesting, doesn't seem to care [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1471.32s)]
*  about Tucker's viewers, doesn't go into trans bathrooms, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1473.16s)]
*  because that's what Tucker's viewers want. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1477.32s)]
*  Putin goes, I don't care. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1479.04s)]
*  I'm gonna talk about the 1300s. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1480.08s)]
*  I don't care about you. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1481.8s)]
*  I don't care about your question. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1483.08s)]
*  I'm getting my message off. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1484.16s)]
*  Prince Oleg. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1485.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1486.12s)]
*  Tucker's viewers were like, talk about the bathrooms [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1486.96s)]
*  and get going in it. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1489.44s)]
*  They're women, but they're men, but they're women. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1490.72s)]
*  Putin goes, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1492.8s)]
*  Prince Resteke, Prince Oleg was baptized. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1494.28s)]
*  And people going, what the hell's going on? [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1498.56s)]
*  It's a total power move to bring somebody over and go, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1500.6s)]
*  I don't care about your questions. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1503.36s)]
*  I don't care about your viewers. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1505.1999999999998s)]
*  I'm just gonna go. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1506.7199999999998s)]
*  But can a power move be made from a position of weakness, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1507.56s)]
*  I think is what we were asking. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1510.04s)]
*  You're gonna grab this guy that you know you can bully [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1511.32s)]
*  and do the power move on because you're weak. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1514.28s)]
*  Why is Putin weak though? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1517.1999999999998s)]
*  He's winning the Ukraine war. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1519.0s)]
*  Barely. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1520.32s)]
*  The sanctions. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1521.1599999999999s)]
*  The third overtime. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1521.98s)]
*  It should have been over. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1522.82s)]
*  It's the third, he's one of the powerful countries [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1523.6599999999999s)]
*  in the world. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1524.9599999999998s)]
*  He's got 200 nuclear weapons. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1525.8s)]
*  Putin doesn't wanna destroy the entire country of Ukraine. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1526.62s)]
*  He went in there with not a ton of troops. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1529.36s)]
*  Putin never wanted the Ukraine. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1531.52s)]
*  I think he wants a deal and I think he's really trying [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1533.6s)]
*  to get to the thing about that. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1535.4399999999998s)]
*  He wants a deal with the US to tell the Ukraine [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1536.28s)]
*  not to negotiate. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1537.32s)]
*  We're the ones that telling them we don't want a deal. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1538.1599999999999s)]
*  We're fighting a proxy war with Russia. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1540.12s)]
*  Through the Ukraine, we keep telling Zelensky, no deal. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1542.08s)]
*  There could have been a deal before the invasion. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1545.02s)]
*  There could have been a deal with the Minsk Accords, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1547.3999999999999s)]
*  which we told Zelensky about a time. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1548.96s)]
*  With the powers that be are getting paid. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1549.8s)]
*  That's the thing that a lot of people don't realize [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1551.84s)]
*  is that when we're giving money to Ukraine, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1553.74s)]
*  we're not giving money to them. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1556.0s)]
*  It's a viral marketing campaign for General Dynamics. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1557.28s)]
*  Yes, but explain that to them. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1560.52s)]
*  Because you see all these articles, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1562.32s)]
*  they're like, can you believe it? [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1564.6399999999999s)]
*  They're starving Americans here. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1565.8s)]
*  When countries join NATO, they sign on a paper saying [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1567.1599999999999s)]
*  all of our weapons purchases are to be [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1570.3999999999999s)]
*  from these NATO approved contractors. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1572.8s)]
*  Which just happen to be Lockheed, Boeing, Raytheon. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1574.84s)]
*  Essentially, they're like, we're gonna put Ukraine in NATO. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1580.52s)]
*  It's coming. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1582.6599999999999s)]
*  Putin's like, you're not putting NATO missiles [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1583.5s)]
*  on the border of Russia. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1585.36s)]
*  It's not gonna happen. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1586.32s)]
*  Russia's been invaded through the Ukraine multiple times. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1587.56s)]
*  Russia's been invaded multiple times in its history. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1590.48s)]
*  Putin's like, it's not gonna happen. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1592.8s)]
*  If you do that, that is the line in the sand. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1594.2s)]
*  That is the red line. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1596.6s)]
*  And that's why we have a war. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1598.0s)]
*  Obviously, it's not right. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1599.3999999999999s)]
*  It's a war of aggression. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1600.76s)]
*  People are dying. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1601.6399999999999s)]
*  It's sad. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1602.48s)]
*  But the United States fully instigated this war [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1603.3s)]
*  and fully wants it and is enjoying it. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1605.3999999999999s)]
*  So we're back to what we do well. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1607.3999999999999s)]
*  We're doing it well. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1608.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's why. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1609.76s)]
*  Why do we have to tuck our cocks between our legs? [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1611.0s)]
*  Fighting whites. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1613.04s)]
*  They're white. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1613.8799999999999s)]
*  We stopped at the Brown on Brown. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1615.12s)]
*  No, we got white. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1616.8s)]
*  This is good. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1617.6399999999999s)]
*  And then Tucker's going in there fucking it all up. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1618.4799999999998s)]
*  I don't think he's fucking it up. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1620.9599999999998s)]
*  I think he's making it interesting. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1621.8s)]
*  I think we get to work. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1623.1999999999998s)]
*  Making a mockery. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1624.04s)]
*  I think it's boring and I think, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1624.8799999999999s)]
*  it's like we all check out, remember when that guy. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1626.6799999999998s)]

*  Yeah, because it gets boring. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1629.4799999999998s)]
*  Ah. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1631.04s)]
*  We started to watch Israel and Gaza [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1632.4799999999998s)]
*  because that came on Netflix. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1634.52s)]
*  And we're like, ooh. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1635.6s)]
*  We go, ooh, ooh. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1636.4399999999998s)]
*  That's the new shit. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1637.26s)]
*  Oh, this is interesting. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1638.1s)]
*  And that game was way better. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1638.9399999999998s)]
*  And then, but we got. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1639.76s)]
*  It's like when Real Housewives of New Jersey [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1640.6s)]
*  brought back Danielle. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1641.4399999999998s)]
*  You need Danielle. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1642.3999999999999s)]
*  Danielle's gonna spice it up. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1644.2s)]
*  I hate that I know. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1645.0s)]
*  It needs Danielle's sauce. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1645.8400000000001s)]
*  Danielle's great. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1646.68s)]
*  She's energy. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1647.52s)]
*  It's an amazing. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1648.48s)]
*  You need to bring in a villain [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1649.3200000000002s)]
*  so people can get excited again. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1653.3200000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1655.16s)]
*  And I think that's part of what we need to do. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1656.0s)]
*  So is Tucker a pawn? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1657.5600000000002s)]
*  Is the State Department telling Tucker, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1659.76s)]
*  hey, go over there, tell him about the grocery. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1661.3200000000002s)]
*  No, but I mean, he's allowed to do it. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1662.8400000000001s)]
*  No one's, he's not suffering any consequences, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1664.2s)]
*  nor should he. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1666.3200000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's a free speech thing. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1667.16s)]
*  But like, I think it serves everybody's purposes. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1668.0s)]
*  He gets views. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1672.3600000000001s)]
*  He gets clicks. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1673.32s)]
*  People get interested and excited. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1674.48s)]
*  You know, Putin gets to get his message out. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1677.16s)]
*  A bit boring. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1679.74s)]
*  He's not exactly fun. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1681.36s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1683.76s)]
*  But it's interesting. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1684.68s)]
*  You know, if you listen to him, you go, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1685.8799999999999s)]
*  oh, this is interesting. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1687.12s)]
*  I mean, was it? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1689.3999999999999s)]
*  I was so. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1691.08s)]
*  I couldn't do it. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1691.92s)]
*  I like when he trolled Tucker and he was like, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1692.76s)]
*  you know, the CIA, an institution you tried to get in. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1694.96s)]
*  That was good. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1698.24s)]
*  He was ready. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1699.08s)]
*  Putin's basically saying, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1699.92s)]
*  I only respect people that are coming here to kill me. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1700.74s)]
*  I only respect power. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1702.72s)]
*  The media to me means nothing. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1703.64s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1705.1200000000001s)]
*  We own it in Russia. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1705.96s)]
*  You're a journalist. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1706.78s)]
*  That means nothing to me. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1707.6200000000001s)]
*  Even if you agree with me, I would respect you [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1708.46s)]
*  if you were coming here to poison me. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1711.0s)]
*  Because that's my people. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1713.0s)]
*  That's what we do. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1714.2s)]
*  And when he said, there were always our enemies, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1715.44s)]
*  he smiled a little bit. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1717.84s)]
*  CIA goes, yeah, there were always our enemies. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1718.68s)]
*  Because you know, a job is a job. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1720.6000000000001s)]
*  But he's basically saying is like, I respect them. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1721.8s)]
*  Because that's the game. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1724.4s)]
*  He was like, yo, they blew up the Nord Stream pipeline. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1725.92s)]
*  And he was like, they did a good job. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1728.84s)]

*  Do you watch these things more than once? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1732.1599999999999s)]
*  Because you analyze this the way guys analyze [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1734.6s)]
*  all 22 after a football game. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1737.62s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1738.9199999999998s)]

*  I just found it really interesting. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1745.72s)]
*  Because that's the longest, you know, Putin, by the way, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1747.1599999999999s)]

*  And they're incredibly boring. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1751.36s)]
*  He talks about agriculture production [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1752.36s)]
*  in a province of Russia. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1755.72s)]
*  It's incredibly boring. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1757.3999999999999s)]
*  People that live in Russia know that. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1758.84s)]
*  They'll be like, the greatest speech, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1760.96s)]
*  the speech to end all speeches. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1762.28s)]
*  You know, and then it's Putin just going on [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1764.16s)]
*  kind of about some pretty like generic, vague crap. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1766.04s)]

*  but it's like you live in Manhattan, you're never rich. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1828.74s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1832.1s)]
*  You just have so many people [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1832.92s)]
*  that are so much more wealthy around you. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1834.5s)]
*  That's right. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1836.18s)]
*  That is a thing that's sitting next to me. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1837.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's a lie. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1838.3799999999999s)]
*  But that is an interesting thing [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1840.26s)]
*  about living in the city is that I think you feel. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1843.3s)]
*  He has to share his money with us, fucking loser. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1846.06s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1847.58s)]
*  I think you feel comfortable talking about money [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1849.06s)]
*  because you are so much poorer [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1852.1399999999999s)]
*  than the guy who lives across the street, down the block. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1854.6599999999999s)]
*  Like you're constantly put in front of people. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1857.5s)]
*  And I think that's good [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1860.58s)]
*  because you shouldn't ever be at the top of anything. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1861.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's humbling, but it's also like, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1864.3799999999999s)]
*  you might speak about something, not you, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1867.58s)]
*  we might speak about something [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1869.42s)]
*  that looks as if it's bragging, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1870.86s)]
*  but it's so far beneath where you know it can go [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1872.42s)]
*  that it doesn't feel in any way like it was. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1875.46s)]
*  Yeah, there's also like, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1877.26s)]
*  there's generational money in places like New York [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1879.78s)]
*  where you're like, oh, I could never have. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1882.1s)]
*  They can't spend it. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1884.1s)]
*  They can't spend it. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1885.34s)]
*  They can't earn it in one lifetime. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1886.18s)]
*  It's just there forever. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1888.34s)]
*  They're just the custodian of the money. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1889.6200000000001s)]
*  But they kind of, a lot of those people, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1891.02s)]
*  their lives kind of lack something that ours have. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1892.9s)]
*  They're in no shape in their life. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1896.18s)]
*  They kind of float around, they're never intense. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1898.14s)]
*  So this is the thing that I wanted to ask you about. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1900.8600000000001s)]
*  There's like these legacy families [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1902.26s)]
*  that have existed throughout history. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1903.8600000000001s)]
*  Ross Childs is one of them. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1905.06s)]
*  Obviously Rockefellers, Vanderbilts, right? [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1907.74s)]
*  Some of these families maintain the wealth [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1909.06s)]
*  for fucking generations, maybe hundreds of years. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1912.4599999999998s)]
*  Some of them within a few generations fall apart. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1914.9799999999998s)]
*  And why is that? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1917.78s)]
*  Kids. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1918.78s)]
*  But they all have kids. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1919.82s)]
*  I know, but some are better than others. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1921.06s)]
*  So some have a culture that like is very strict. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1922.6999999999998s)]
*  The Vanderbilts, the last one is Anderson Cooper. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1926.26s)]
*  So the Vanderbilts made their money in? [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1929.5s)]
*  Railroads. Railroads. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1931.62s)]
*  He was a shipping magnate first. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1933.5s)]
*  And then he got into railroads. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1937.3s)]
*  They called him the Commodore. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1938.1399999999999s)]
*  He was a big, you know, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1938.98s)]
*  ships going from Brooklyn to New York back and forth. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1940.3799999999999s)]
*  Is Vanderbilt the one that has the home in Rhode Island? [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1942.4199999999998s)]
*  They have the Billmore in North Carolina. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1946.06s)]
*  Yeah, they had all these amazing things, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1949.5s)]
*  but you know, you got to have lots of kids [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1951.6999999999998s)]
*  and the kids have to continue the business in some respect. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1954.98s)]
*  A lot of families squander money [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1960.3s)]
*  and a lot of kids just, you know, they suck, right? [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1963.1399999999999s)]
*  So that's what I'm trying to understand is like, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1966.26s)]
*  how do you maintain, like who is it? [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1968.02s)]
*  Like with the Royal Family, for example, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1971.3s)]
*  there's probably a team, a deep state, if you will, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1972.74s)]
*  that is built to maintain the family [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1975.9399999999998s)]
*  despite how retarded the family is. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1978.82s)]
*  So it's interesting because you go down to Palm Beach, right? [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1981.5s)]
*  You drive around like Worth Avenue and Palm Beach [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1983.5s)]
*  and before you get down there, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1985.8999999999999s)]
*  you see all these family offices. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1986.9399999999998s)]
*  You'll see like this trust and that trust [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1988.3799999999999s)]
*  and the children trust and this trust. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1990.34s)]
*  And those are family offices. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1992.06s)]
*  You have one office dedicated [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1993.3s)]
*  to managing the wealth of one family. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1995.3s)]
*  So that is something that... [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1997.5s)]
*  So even if the kids are fuck-ups, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=1999.74s)]
*  the trust is built in a way to be fuck-up proof. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2001.86s)]
*  That's right. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2004.7s)]
*  So they go have kids, but some of these families, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2005.54s)]
*  the kids aren't fuck-ups and they continue to do good shit [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2007.1s)]
*  and I'm like, how do you instill the productive values [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2009.74s)]
*  in the kids? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2014.1s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2014.94s)]
*  Yeah, so they just don't squander everything [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2015.78s)]
*  and who does it the best? [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2017.22s)]
*  Do you just need one good kid every couple of generations? [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2018.22s)]
*  That's a good point too, like you need the whole family. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2020.86s)]
*  Does every kid have to have the culture? [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2021.8600000000001s)]
*  Because one thing... [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2023.3400000000001s)]
*  Be changed, right? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2024.18s)]
*  So the other important thing is the industries change, right? [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2025.02s)]
*  So much of the largest consolidation of wealth [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2027.5s)]
*  in human history is in Northern California right now. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2030.18s)]
*  It's a $9 trillion market cap [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2032.3s)]
*  and it's because every big tech company [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2033.82s)]
*  that we know about is sitting somewhere between [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2035.78s)]
*  San Francisco and Palo Alto. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2039.18s)]
*  That's where a huge amount of money [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2042.1000000000001s)]
*  is being generated right now, right? [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2043.98s)]
*  So if you're in an industry that is, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2045.5800000000002s)]
*  can be modernized and can evolve [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2050.02s)]
*  and can still make money, you're great. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2055.22s)]
*  If you're in a, there are like heiresses and people [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2057.46s)]
*  that their family owned a stationary company, right? [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2061.02s)]
*  They owned a paper company, right? [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2064.5s)]
*  And all of a sudden we all... [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2066.1s)]
*  That's all the West Virginia, like there's these [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2067.94s)]
*  mansions and shit in West Virginia [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2069.7s)]
*  because of the coal industry. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2071.06s)]
*  Right, so it really depends on where you made your money. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2072.3s)]
*  Did you diversify? [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2075.46s)]
*  Did you get into human trafficking, narco trafficking, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2076.5s)]
*  drug trafficking, political assassinations, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2080.78s)]
*  flipping elections, working with the CIA, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2082.86s)]
*  working with the Mossad, working with MI6? [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2084.94s)]
*  Did you get into that stuff? [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2087.42s)]
*  Did you blackmail people? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2088.58s)]
*  Did you kill them? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2089.54s)]
*  Did you blow up their cars? [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2090.38s)]
*  Did you visit South American capitals, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2091.94s)]
*  get into the drug trade, get into the drug game, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2093.78s)]
*  make friends, you know what I mean? [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2096.02s)]
*  Did you do that or did you just sit around at Yale [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2097.82s)]
*  and jerk off? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2099.7400000000002s)]
*  What did you do? [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2100.58s)]
*  What did you do with it? [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2101.86s)]
*  Did you make it worth your while? [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2103.82s)]
*  That was magnificent. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2105.62s)]
*  That was a wonderful... [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2107.46s)]
*  You gotta work. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2108.7799999999997s)]
*  So what happens? [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2110.3799999999997s)]
*  They make all the money and then they go, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2111.22s)]
*  okay, there's a limit to what I can do [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2112.62s)]
*  with all this fucking money because these politicians, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2114.62s)]
*  I might as well be a politician [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2116.8999999999996s)]
*  or maybe make my kid a politician. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2118.8999999999996s)]

*  Did you see when JJ Reddick called out Doc Rivers? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2643.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2646.38s)]
*  So Doc is a guy that I, I don't know, [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2647.46s)]
*  something about him always just felt weird to me, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2649.7400000000002s)]
*  and then he goes to coach the Bucks, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2651.34s)]
*  their head coach gets fired mid-season. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2654.5s)]
*  He gets 40 million a year, and then he keeps being like, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2656.5s)]
*  yeah, you know, we're gonna suck for a while. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2658.9s)]

*  And then JJ Reddick is like, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2663.7400000000002s)]
*  there's never any accountability with this guy. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2665.3s)]
*  He's always blaming someone else, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2667.34s)]
*  and JJ Reddick played for him. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2668.7400000000002s)]
*  Ex-coach. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2670.06s)]

*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2679.98s)]
*  We gotta bring JJ on the pot. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2680.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2681.78s)]
*  That's gonna be, yeah, that'll be fun. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2682.62s)]
*  He'd be a good person to get some perspective on the league. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2684.66s)]
*  Also, I wanna learn about like the Duke days. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2687.14s)]
*  Yeah, and it's cool to see the transformation [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2689.5s)]
*  from like this kid that everyone hated. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2691.58s)]
*  Because he was hated. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2692.42s)]
*  Hated. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2693.2599999999998s)]
*  And now it was just like this fucking very calm, cool dad [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2694.54s)]
*  that's like very thoughtful in everything he says, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2697.58s)]
*  even if it's a hot take. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2699.58s)]
*  It's well thought out. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2700.98s)]
*  He's great. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2701.9s)]
*  Maybe the best in basketball right now with Novan Gundy. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2703.46s)]
*  Yeah, we might have to have JJ on. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2706.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2708.2599999999998s)]
*  We gotta talk about how pale he was at Duke. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2709.1s)]
*  It was almost like he was leaning in to be white. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2711.66s)]
*  Duke wanted him to be there. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2713.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2714.9s)]
*  Don't go out in the sun. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2715.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2716.58s)]
*  We got much to move. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2717.42s)]
*  All right, let's get back to the show, man, with Tim Dill. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2720.54s)]
*  Who is peep on Israel and who is not? [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2722.8199999999997s)]
*  The squad, those people are very vocal. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2725.38s)]
*  I feel like the squad barely says anything anymore. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2728.06s)]
*  Well, one does, the Rashida Tlaib, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2729.7799999999997s)]
*  because she's Palestinian. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2731.7s)]
*  So she got to. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2732.7s)]
*  She has to. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2733.54s)]
*  She's gotta pop off. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2734.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2735.38s)]
*  She's the Macklemore of our, you know what I mean? [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2736.2599999999998s)]
*  Because he's also popping off. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2741.02s)]
*  How about the guy that lit himself on? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2743.94s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2745.7s)]
*  I just heard about this. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2746.54s)]
*  Lit himself on fire, said free Palestine. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2747.38s)]
*  What happened? [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2748.38s)]
*  He was a soldier, right? [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2749.7s)]
*  Outside of the Israeli embassy, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2750.98s)]
*  lit himself on fire to protest the war. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2752.78s)]
*  And which my whole point is, they don't care about that, [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2756.54s)]
*  that's what they're doing. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2758.94s)]
*  Are you sure he lit himself on fire? [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2760.14s)]
*  Yeah, he lit himself on fire, [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2762.26s)]
*  and Israel's like, you saved this time. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2763.86s)]
*  And thank you. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2766.9s)]
*  They were like, this is a real cost effect. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2767.9s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2769.34s)]
*  This is a protest. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2770.54s)]
*  He lit himself on fire. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2771.38s)]
*  This is an US Air Force soldier, right? [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2772.9s)]
*  It's a self-immolation. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2774.7s)]
*  And what he was doing, this is an old school way of protest [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2776.82s)]
*  where you light yourself on fire [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2779.46s)]
*  to protest something that you do not like. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2781.66s)]
*  And this person. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2784.78s)]
*  This is Eastern philosophy. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2787.02s)]
*  This is very, I don't know whose philosophy this is. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2788.74s)]
*  Raging against the machine. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2791.94s)]
*  It is Eastern. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2792.94s)]
*  Isn't it, didn't the monks do it or something? [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2794.86s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2797.18s)]
*  It was a guy who did it to protest some type of, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2798.18s)]
*  you're right, it was an Asian protest. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2802.8199999999997s)]
*  Did they put him out or did he die? [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2804.7s)]
*  No, he died. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2806.74s)]
*  They put him out, but he succumbed to his injuries [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2807.66s)]
*  in the hospital. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2811.5s)]
*  Let's just be very honest here. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2813.3399999999997s)]
*  In terms of pure stagecraft, I like this. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2815.22s)]
*  Talk to us. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2818.14s)]
*  I like it because... [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2818.98s)]
*  I like it because... [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2820.86s)]
*  I like it because, first of all, it's new. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2821.86s)]
*  I like the focus on one person. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2824.86s)]
*  All these protests, there's so many people in the streets. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2826.86s)]
*  It gets lost, right? [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2829.86s)]
*  This is really going back to the old school. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2830.86s)]
*  One person. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2832.86s)]
*  Tim's just watching a play. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2833.86s)]
*  One can of gas, one person in front of the thing. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2834.86s)]
*  And it's just, your eyes are trained right on him. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2838.86s)]
*  The message doesn't change. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2841.86s)]
*  The message is, you know, [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2842.86s)]
*  you're not going to get away with this. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2844.86s)]
*  You're going to get away with this. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2846.86s)]
*  The message doesn't get muddled. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2849.86s)]
*  It's free Palestine. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2851.86s)]
*  Because in the big protest, you know what happens. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2852.86s)]

*  Think they have to have some [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2961.02s)]
*  America hasn't got the power to make Israel stop the war. Whoa, we don't take we don't have the power [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2963.74s)]
*  Take no, I mean, what does that mean? Are you trying to say no, they have a military they have money [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2970.86s)]
*  But if the whole UN votes for a ceasefire and the US raises their hand as well, then what Israel says fuck y'all [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2976.58s)]
*  Well, yes, but also we're not doing that. We're not doing that. The best you're gonna get is for Biden to say [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=2983.02s)]

*  it is a [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3004.7999999999997s)]
*  Thing that has made the region less safe and I'm not even putting this all on Israel obviously [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3006.4799999999996s)]
*  But like this is just you know, I think I think 80% of Gaza's now uninhabitable [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3010.9199999999996s)]
*  You know, I don't know how it goes back to [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3018.24s)]
*  Anything that we understand I think it moves forward in a way that has to be [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3021.7999999999997s)]
*  Arab countries like Saudi Arabia in the United States. They've got a police. Yeah, they have to rebuild it [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3026.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, they have to kick in a lot of money [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3031.4399999999996s)]
*  But this is not gonna get somebody to stop the war and I have a ton of sympathy for [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3033.4399999999996s)]
*  Innocent people in Gaza dying that had nothing to do with this that have been also crushed under Hamas. Yeah [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3037.8399999999997s)]
*  This is the loss of life is absolutely staggering I think Israel had a 9-eleven moment where they want a little overboard [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3044.24s)]
*  I think we want a little overboard for sure. Yeah after 9-eleven [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3050.8799999999997s)]
*  I think we did things that were unwise and ultimately made us less [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3054.16s)]
*  What was the right amount of people we should have killed? [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3056.8399999999997s)]
*  Cuz I hear people saying what they're like, it's too many babies killed and there's well, what's the right of there's no way to say it [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3060.52s)]
*  Like yeah language doesn't work when you're talking about thousands of people dying [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3066.3199999999997s)]
*  I say little over it. It sounds like I'm being callous about it [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3070.8s)]
*  but the other the other problem is if I really like if I say [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3075.44s)]
*  right if I say like it was a [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3080.28s)]
*  Genocide then that has this political connotation that yeah [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3083.76s)]
*  So then it's like then you can't have a discussion about how to end anything because people are gonna [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3087.28s)]
*  Just go nuts about words words like no the goal just like Trump was right when they said what's the goal in the Ukraine war? [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3092.0s)]
*  He's like no more dying no more war [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3097.56s)]
*  What do you mean and he's like, well, I don't want anyone to die anymore [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3100.44s)]
*  Yeah, we should stop the war and she's like, but do you want and it's like no no [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3104.08s)]
*  My goal everyone's goal because I'm an Irish Catholic from Long Island [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3108.48s)]
*  Yeah grew up with none of I didn't this was not a meaningful thing for my family [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3112.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's not like my mother came home and was like, hey, is really like we just weren't [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3117.24s)]
*  You know, I'm not super educated about the issue either. I don't pretend to be I just know [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3121.4s)]
*  That we can't see levels of of destruction like this [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3126.68s)]
*  Yeah in the modern world when you're looking at your phone and you're seeing children displaced and families displaced and no hospitals and those [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3130.92s)]
*  It's not gonna work and I think [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3139.16s)]
*  Ultimately, it makes Israel less safe and it diminishes their credibility internationally a reaction like this. Yeah [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3141.68s)]
*  Yeah, that doesn't mean that [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3149.32s)]
*  They shouldn't have responded. They needed to respond. They absolutely had to respond [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3151.72s)]
*  It was an attack on Israel from Hamas. It was an act of war. You also respond with an act [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3155.16s)]
*  You respond with an act of war. Yeah completely understandable violence begets violence [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3160.6s)]
*  violence begets violence at some point in any conflict you have to [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3164.96s)]
*  Figure out how to end the conflict. Do you think that the [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3169.7999999999997s)]
*  Do you think that the countries in in the Middle East yeah are [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3174.44s)]
*  In some ways complicit with what's happening like they almost kind of want [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3179.16s)]
*  Terrorism wiped out so they can get some Western dollars in there [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3185.2s)]

*  Yeah, they've always been kind of an agitator in that region [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3194.72s)]
*  They don't really get along with Saudi Arabia Saudi and Arabian Israel actually had like kind of a kind of boys UAE Israel's good [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3198.92s)]
*  Jordan Israel's but I think this has strained a lot of those relationships too because the citizens in those countries are like this is the [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3206.12s)]
*  Citizens I think are furious, but I wonder if the governments are like hey listen, we need no terrorism over here [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3212.6s)]
*  We can't have random bomb. Yes, I don't want any of this political unrest if you got a lot [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3217.16s)]

*  When they were trying to kick the heads of Hamas out of the Four Seasons, though Qatar I said no [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3227.3199999999997s)]
*  Because I believe in brand loyalty as a concept yeah [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3233.32s)]
*  They had lived in the Four Seasons for a very long time [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3237.56s)]
*  First of all, there's not a lot of great chains in hotels in the world [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3239.76s)]
*  There are not yeah, they're not they stayed in a lot [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3243.36s)]
*  you know and I'm saying I didn't disagree with what Hamas did but but [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3245.56s)]
*  Making them stay at a lesser hotel is not gonna make them less angry [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3251.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's gonna piss them off you butter them up. I said leave them in the Four Seasons [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3255.84s)]

*  In the modern world why why all this stuff is crazy? Hmm. It's insane is because that's a news story [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3274.48s)]
*  Should the leaders of Hamas get kicked out of the Four Seasons? Yeah, that's insane [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3282.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's an insane news right why is there not more pressure on [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3286.9199999999996s)]

*  But it's not as good the eggs are not as good [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3343.5s)]
*  Yeah, so we all have to decide which horrors we want to participate in and for what and for what reason yeah [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3346.14s)]

*  That's it. That's it. So they want that's what they want and Putin genuinely believes whether he's right or wrong or whether people think he's overreacting [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3938.42s)]
*  Or not. Yeah, he believes there is an existential threat [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3946.48s)]
*  Through NATO to Russia. Yeah, and I think he's probably correct [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3950.32s)]
*  But isn't there always one from your neighbors? Like I hate when people bring up that argument [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3956.08s)]

*  If we will send weapons, we will send weapons will not go and why is that not a violation? [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=3998.4s)]
*  Like if you're supplying the weapons of the people that are killing me like I'm at war with you fun [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4003.4s)]
*  Because okay, so those are the rules of the game. It's the rules of the game and that's why he smiles at it [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4007.2799999999997s)]

*  But yeah, I mean it's like [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4061.2000000000003s)]
*  We won't go there and we won't do it. We just have to give them the weapons [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4062.76s)]
*  We can't do it because then a direct confrontation, but we don't want to wreck if we did Nord Stream [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4066.4s)]
*  That's direct confrontation, but we can we can prove it and how but isn't what he brought something up on it [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4071.44s)]
*  He is there's only one country that's capable of doing it. Yeah [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4077.76s)]
*  Who knows we did it but here's the deal. Yeah [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4082.48s)]
*  He cannot allow American troops to kill Russian soldiers in the Ukraine without [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4085.36s)]
*  Responding by going to a hot war with America we can underhand it [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4091.88s)]
*  Oh now I'm getting it okay [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4097.76s)]
*  So so basically he might not even want to go into a hot war but his people lose respect for him [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4099.08s)]
*  And his power will be threatened if he doesn't go to a war. They'll do a coup. So he's only [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4104.22s)]
*  Acting so as long as we behave in a way where he doesn't have to react now [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4109.320000000001s)]
*  They must know that we're supplying the weapons. We're literally talking about in the news. We're going 14 billion dollars [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4113.12s)]
*  Oh, he knows he's literally said stop supplying the weapons and the war will end in two weeks [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4117.84s)]
*  Now at the same time you could probably argue we're also supplying food in some way to the Russian army [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4123.32s)]
*  We're supplying coca-cola is like their global economy is so intermixed. Yeah, it's you know at the end of the day. It's like [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4128.56s)]
*  This is a geopolitical geopolitical chess game [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4137.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, and there's things we can do without going into a wider war [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4140.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4145.12s)]
*  And there's things we can't do we can't put troops on the ground and we won't our citizenry will not tolerate [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4145.52s)]
*  We can put all the flags up we can you know do all the songs and the dances [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4151.78s)]
*  Yeah, we will not tolerate American troops in harm's way in the Ukraine. Well, he's separate separate [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4156.219999999999s)]
*  Russian rocket that can take down satellites with your opinion [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4163.0599999999995s)]
*  Do I mean do I know how like accurate it is? I mean the Russians have a lot of stuff [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4167.179999999999s)]
*  They've you know, Putin rebuilt that country. Do they yeah name a Russian car [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4173.62s)]
*  Yeah, but they're not gonna bomb us with a car [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4177.94s)]
*  If you can't make a car you can make a bomb no, you can make a bomb I don't think you can [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4180.5s)]
*  The reason that they don't make it make cars is because all the money goes into bombs and things like that they [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4188.7s)]
*  Economy, let's not subscribe to it. It's fact. I don't believe it. We don't know it's fact [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4197.259999999999s)]
*  You haven't seen my mother believe the Obama was a Christian [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4201.5s)]
*  So he's not it was like, you know, she goes there's prayer rugs in the White House. I go really okay [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4204.5s)]
*  The reality is Russia decided a long time of all they have is to teeth they have fear they do not have an economy [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4211.58s)]
*  They're never gonna compete with us economically. Yeah, they don't have the people we have they don't have the ingenuity [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4217.76s)]
*  They don't have any natural resources. They don't need any of that. Yeah, but they [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4221.94s)]
*  Brazil has natural resources that they need nukes. They need fear. They need the ability to pulverize they need [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4226.06s)]
*  They need to be scary. Yeah, they're not scary. Then what are they? They've got an economy roughly the size of Brazil [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4232.9s)]
*  It's not it's not a big deal. It's not a big deal. They need to be scary [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4238.78s)]
*  So they have scary stuff. Otherwise, we would treat them like Iraq if they didn't have these nukes we would he'd be gone already [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4241.9s)]
*  Yeah, he'd be okay. You would treat him like I write beat we we put him in a hole [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4248.5s)]
*  Yeah, we knew he didn't have weapons of mass destruction. That's why we went in there. Yeah, but there's not 150 million people [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4253.3s)]
*  Point that's the thing [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4258.18s)]
*  We would we would set up a puppet government it would be fine [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4260.900000000001s)]
*  But if we don't want to go in there because we know that he has nuclear weapons [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4264.34s)]
*  That's what countries want nukes because it's the last line of defense. Yeah against the West [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4268.660000000001s)]
*  Okay, Mike my thought if we talk about geopolitical chess to me the only reason I'm I guess I don't know if I support the war [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4274.02s)]
*  But I'm okay with hopefully seeing Russia come over to this team because China is the largest looming threat in my brain [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4280.06s)]
*  Right you're the same members of our foreign policy establishment are saying we need to focus a lot less on Russia and a lot more on [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4286.42s)]
*  China, but if we can get right over to our side, even if Putin falls Russia eventually becomes Western [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4293.620000000001s)]
*  I don't think so. I don't think the next guy is gonna be a friend of ours. I think this was kind of a strategic mistake [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4298.9800000000005s)]
*  I think we should have probably said hey, let's do a deal. Let's do a deal [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4304.38s)]
*  But I also just don't think we're that afraid of China either. I think that [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4308.56s)]
*  Is underestimating yeah, we might be underestimating I just think we're not that afraid of China [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4312.14s)]
*  I think it's like we need China China needs us. Yeah, I don't think we're that afraid [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4316.22s)]
*  Destruction if we were that afraid I think we wouldn't be spending all these resources in the yeah [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4319.860000000001s)]
*  I just feel like cooler heads will prevail [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4323.66s)]
*  With China perhaps. Okay, however, then we're gonna they're gonna probably maybe take Taiwan. I need to understand something [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4326.900000000001s)]
*  Okay, we can't let them take Taiwan and so we can make the chips [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4333.06s)]
*  That's a big deal with these chips and then I agree media out here like holding the whole stock market on its shoulders [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4336.099999999999s)]

*  Get on there. It's super fun. Let's get back to the show [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4614.36s)]
*  I'm trying to understand this George Soros character. Okay, I hear his name a lot [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4616.74s)]
*  Sure, it's this boogeyman thing sure and I'm trying to okay [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4621.98s)]
*  I'm trying to parse something here is he the equal and opposite reaction to like the Koch brothers? [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4625.34s)]
*  Yes, I would say that [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4633.0599999999995s)]
*  The Koch brothers probably can you explain to they are to the to the audience? Yeah [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4635.54s)]
*  I mean there are a family of right-wing billionaires that are kind of more libertarian. They really love free markets [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4640.94s)]
*  They love free trade. They want to make money. They own like Dixie Cup like they owned oil [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4647.299999999999s)]
*  They have everything right, but they are big donors. They're big donors to a public right-wing causes [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4652.98s)]
*  Yeah, and these and I assume they they have done they've kind of weaponized philanthropy in a very interesting way [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4657.66s)]
*  Yeah, they set up all these foundations and then reroute all that money that's where I had my kid was a coke [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4664.0599999999995s)]
*  The best of New York Presbyterian hospitals theater is the met love, you know, they right so doing great job [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4669.299999999999s)]
*  They are a huge force in right-wing politics. Okay, so now I'm assuming that some of this philanthropy is benevolent [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4675.259999999999s)]
*  Sure, they have more of an interest in federal policy [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4681.5s)]
*  He has more of an interest in state policy crime. Well, I want to get to that one side [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4684.139999999999s)]
*  Okay, but I assume that all these donations are not necessarily altruistic. They in some way. Yes help the Koch brothers business [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4688.639999999999s)]
*  Pursuits right they can make change legislation. Yes, make a little easier to do business make some more money, right? [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4697.74s)]
*  So that's what you're dumping money [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4703.780000000001s)]
*  It's a great money in there's a great book about this called dark money by Jane Mayer where she wrote about how the Koch brothers [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4704.860000000001s)]
*  Realized it was a limit to campaign contributions and then they started, you know [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4711.14s)]
*  Infiltrating universities. They started really selecting people to be professors [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4715.900000000001s)]
*  They went on a granular level to try to advance their policy ideas. Yeah influence culture and okay [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4720.860000000001s)]
*  But I understand this because as long as these policies are out there and these ideologies out there and then maybe they might look [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4726.92s)]
*  At it be like, you know, we're being heroes. We're actually saving the United States of America [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4731.88s)]
*  That's right in freedom. So I'm not saying that they're nefarious actors. Sure, but all the things that they support [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4734.84s)]
*  Potentially make them more money, right? Oh, yes. Okay, so that's ideally friends and their friends more money [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4741.12s)]
*  So that's bottom line. So I guess I'm trying to understand if Soros is the equal and opposite [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4747.24s)]
*  Yeah reaction in other words the quote-unquote benevolent [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4751.84s)]
*  Donator from the the left-wing side [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4755.919999999999s)]
*  What is he donating to that helps his businesses like what are his businesses that this deploying this type of cash is? [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4758.639999999999s)]
*  Supports [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4766.12s)]
*  Made billions of dollars a long time ago crashing the English pound. I read that he's a [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4768.12s)]
*  Financier, but his interest is in social policy. So so how does that benefit him? Well, there's a lot of well, there's a lot of [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4773.679999999999s)]
*  ideological [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4782.04s)]
*  Reasons that George Soros believes the things he does like he is a believer that the carceral state in America is [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4783.24s)]
*  That means prison prisons are completely [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4792.96s)]
*  Unfair and unjust and he's not completely wrong there [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4796.719999999999s)]
*  What Soros often does is he will go and get two left-wing DA's and support them both so that? [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4800.96s)]
*  They go head-to-head and that the most left-wing one they push each other to the extremes [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4806.719999999999s)]
*  And then the most extreme one will win [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4811.72s)]
*  And his goals are what he feels like is a is a reformation of the American [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4814.4800000000005s)]
*  criminal justice system to be more focused on [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4820.68s)]
*  Re rehabbing criminals not putting people in jail that don't belong there and [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4825.400000000001s)]
*  You know changing that on paper that looks like it looks great. It looks great on paper now [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4832.200000000001s)]
*  I think that he's been blamed and maybe rightfully so I don't know for [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4838.219999999999s)]
*  The kind of destruction of some liberal cities [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4842.82s)]
*  Well, there are a lot of you know [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4846.0199999999995s)]
*  There are a lot of Soros backed and funded DA's who are pushing ideas like no bail [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4847.86s)]
*  They're pushing ideas like not rising crime in a way. Yeah, and and you know, but how does he make money on this? [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4853.62s)]
*  That's the only thing that's missing from this equation sure here this a lot and if it's pure benevolence [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4860.0599999999995s)]
*  Well justice system that's weird, but there has to be some way where he can profit off of this [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4864.58s)]
*  Well, I'm sure there is by the way. I'm sure there is I think that there's you know [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4869.14s)]
*  all kinds of things and I don't know the source portfolio right, but like [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4872.66s)]
*  There's a lot of tech companies right now that are focusing on like surveillance and things like that because as things get less safe [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4878.0199999999995s)]
*  There's more crime there. You would need more surveillance. Yeah, so that to me makes you know [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4885.42s)]
*  These guys are all behind the vaccine passports they were all behind they are all behind a world in which [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4890.06s)]
*  Everybody is on the grid in a major way [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4897.18s)]
*  So if you're invested in the grid, yeah [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4899.820000000001s)]
*  You want to do everything you can to make sure more people have to sign up for the grid [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4902.740000000001s)]
*  I think you that's making want to deliver people into a world and you have to deliver them through a little chaos [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4908.22s)]
*  You can't force them there, but you can't create a system and make them want this hey give us safety [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4916.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, hey my car got broken into five times. Can you put up some cameras somewhere? [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4921.66s)]
*  Yeah, so now you're begging for your own imprisonment if your goal is government and your goal is a you know [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4924.94s)]
*  You know omnipresent [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4932.42s)]
*  government force [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4934.74s)]
*  Then I think a little street chaos is probably good ultimately [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4936.34s)]
*  But do you believe that's his goal because that's a far cry from I just think the prison system should be reformed [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4940.66s)]
*  I just think he's wrong [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4944.86s)]
*  Here's the thing with George Soros. I just think he's wrong. I don't know how Machiavellian he is [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4946.5s)]
*  I think he's wrong. I think the way that his goals are good the way he's getting there is wrong [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4951.38s)]
*  I think he's wrong. I think people can be wrong. I don't think we have to ascribe [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4957.219999999999s)]
*  Negative motives. Yeah to everybody he could do it. I think he's wrong. Yeah, I think he's wrong. I think that [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4962.299999999999s)]
*  The policies he's pursuing make the people he purports to care about less safe [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4968.82s)]
*  Hmm, and those are poor people people in the inner city things like that that are on public transit are you know? [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4973.7s)]
*  Maybe gonna be the victims of a crime. I think he's wrong [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4980.86s)]
*  I don't know him well enough to know what his overarching motives are and it's hard [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4983.38s)]
*  You know we can say that and I don't know he might I do know that he's [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4989.42s)]
*  Incredibly concerned with [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4995.98s)]
*  What he feel, you know, he pushes the ideology [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=4998.3s)]
*  of [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=5003.66s)]
*  Kind of the DIE the diversity equity inclusion ideology where he believes that the American society is fundamentally unfair [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=5004.74s)]
*  And that it needs to be reformed and I would have some disagreements with him there for sure [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=5012.26s)]
*  But I think he's wrong. I think there's a lot of people that are wrong [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=5018.0599999999995s)]
*  Not necessarily these evil Kara the Koch brothers. I think are wrong. They believe in [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=5022.58s)]
*  unfettered free trade [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=5028.94s)]
*  They believe in open borders because they don't want to pay anyone a wage [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=5031.0599999999995s)]
*  So if they open all the borders and everyone comes in they go do it for a dollar [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=5035.74s)]
*  Yeah, this is why the coke but they're not they don't love El Salvadoran people [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=5038.82s)]

*  Cultural diversity they want to pay people the least amount that they can I think they're wrong [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=5047.94s)]
*  Do I think that there are these? [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=5053.219999999999s)]

*  But God willing, you know independence [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=5300.98s)]
*  Independence you have to fight for it. You have to keep fighting for it forever throughout history [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=5304.54s)]
*  That's the whole thing. You have to just keep fighting for your independence. There's it didn't end with the Revolutionary War [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=5308.099999999999s)]

*  What you'll never get a job. It's like no they created the jobs. Yeah, they created the jobs. They created the institutions [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6822.88s)]
*  They said you need a diversity thing. You need a sensitivity reader [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6828.360000000001s)]

*  The zoomers see how fake it all is they see through it [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6836.58s)]
*  Yeah, and the Millennials do such a bad job of disguising [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6839.740000000001s)]
*  That it's really just like whether you want to call it a jobs program or the revenge of the mediocre [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6843.740000000001s)]
*  That's what a lot of that idea refreshing though that the zoomers see it so clearly [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6848.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well you speak to some of these kids and they're [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6852.5s)]
*  Painfully aware of how ridiculous it is. Yeah, it's kind of laugh at it [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6856.54s)]
*  But it's not like they're not progressive about certain things certain things that make sense like they kind of go. Yeah, obviously [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6859.5s)]
*  Like you know, it's not like their rejection is they have fucking throw gays off the buildings [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6865.700000000001s)]
*  Right, they don't that the bad ones. Yeah, but the but there are a little bit [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6870.34s)]
*  Yeah, they're gay marriage is obvious it's like exactly you're like, yeah, let them get married whatever [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6877.9800000000005s)]
*  But we can also call each other gay and that's not hateful. Yeah [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6882.54s)]
*  It's they've kind of like evened out in a nice area. I think that generation would be the one [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6885.58s)]
*  That is [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6891.88s)]
*  Going to have the biggest [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6893.6s)]
*  Role to play in all of the things we talked about and where America lands. Yeah, you have the most hope for them [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6895.88s)]
*  They well and whether it's it's hope it's certainly interesting to watch. It's too everything you're saying is correct [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6901.96s)]
*  I think it's too soon yet because I [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6907.4800000000005s)]
*  Think you know, we could have looked at like these boomers and what? Wow [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6909.96s)]
*  They they're really rejecting like this commercialism and all of this stuff and then literally they turned on a dime [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6913.6s)]
*  So I don't know which it's very interesting to watch, you know [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6919.32s)]
*  You know, but I think the indications are good from that generation except [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6923.7s)]
*  There's a little nihilism there and the nihilism is a problem and the nihilism [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6928.54s)]
*  Can they can black pill themselves into explain? [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6935.9s)]
*  Yeah, explain nihilism a little bit the idea that because everything is so terrible and all the information is at their finger [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6939.46s)]
*  They can't believe any of the information if not believe any of it and they've disconnected emotionally from it [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6946.280000000001s)]
*  That's why they'll just watch videos and people in their head drops off [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6950.84s)]
*  Oh, so like a lot of the drugs are just a dog's right there [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6953.400000000001s)]
*  I mean euphoria is such an amazing show because it does paint like a pretty accurate [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6956.56s)]
*  Perception of what's going on in a California high school. You have people ODing people struggling with the gender identity [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6960.0s)]
*  Violence you have people's parents, you know, like, you know [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6967.400000000001s)]
*  Issues so it's such a great show that being said like Sam Levinson did a great job of painting an inaccurate picture [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6971.4s)]
*  But you watch a sugar. Wow, what an amazing show then you go. I don't want my kid going there. Yeah [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6977.8s)]
*  Like I don't want my kid going to euphoria high. Yeah, but the nihilism is interesting. I have noticed that was some of them [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6982.44s)]
*  They're a little black eyed. They are black eyed nihilist and I thought it was um, my godson three years old black eyed nihilist [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6988.64s)]
*  Doesn't care unaffected [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6996.56s)]
*  Doesn't seen everything they're just there there. I thought they've seen everything, you know, it's way [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=6998.860000000001s)]
*  I thought this was a I saw a lot of girls that grew up in New York City are like this [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7003.34s)]
*  Oh, yeah, even our generation going to clubs at 14 exactly. They've seen it all [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7007.9800000000005s)]
*  They've been like had fucking disgusting old men with their like parents friends. Try to fuck them, right? [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7011.740000000001s)]

*  If you're protected in a nice lovely little suburb and everybody's polite to one another you're not being manipulated by old dudes every single [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7019.52s)]
*  Day and some guys trying to finger you a work etc [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7025.9s)]
*  Yeah, you can have you know these doughy eyes about the world these girls at 14 going to the fucking they know what it's like [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7027.839999999999s)]
*  And and they have that little bit of nihilism. That's what I see in the zoomers [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7033.32s)]
*  I think you we have a little bit of darkness and it's good [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7037.24s)]
*  But it just they can't OD on it because then it could get a little [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7040.12s)]
*  Unaffected you're just unaffected by anything and you need to be affected to do shit [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7043.599999999999s)]
*  You need to be affected. You need to care a little bit about something. Yeah, very hard [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7046.759999999999s)]
*  It's very hard because the world has gotten crazy. Yeah, and it's always been crazy [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7050.5599999999995s)]
*  But it's now delivered to you that craziness is delivered to you. There's a gang of kids in Arizona [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7055.54s)]
*  white kids [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7061.64s)]
*  running around [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7063.36s)]
*  Attacking other kids randomly. They killed one of the kids Gilbert, Arizona. It's like an hour outside of Phoenix [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7064.72s)]
*  I talked about it on my show [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7069.5199999999995s)]
*  There's endless videotapes of these white kids stomping on the heads of kids [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7071.28s)]
*  Jesus stomping on the heads of children. These kids are raising gated communities in the suburbs. So there is something I think [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7075.68s)]
*  There's a nihilism that goes on where these kids become sociopaths by the they're desensitized [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7082.18s)]
*  Yeah, okay fiction and it's crazy clockwork orange clockwork [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7089.5s)]
*  I just keep pressing Lorde died this 16 year old kid was killed at a house party and [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7093.34s)]
*  You know now they're trying to make a rest. It's kind of difficult, you know, but like [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7098.1s)]
*  They're running around ours. These are rich white kids [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7102.42s)]
*  Who's I mean rich by the standards of Arizona not Manhattan their parents own a fucking gym or something [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7104.820000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7109.400000000001s)]
*  They're also kind of raised in a social media era that's not really about this is gonna sound super fucking pretentious [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7110.4800000000005s)]
*  Whatever, but there's not a lot of art in it. It's more just like clout and clicks. That's correct [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7117.4400000000005s)]
*  How do I get attention? [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7121.4800000000005s)]
*  Whereas there I feel like maybe we had a benefit at least growing up in New York [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7122.76s)]
*  We're like even if you weren't the most successful person if you were the best artist you had a lot of respect like people like [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7126.6s)]
*  Hey, that guy right there is a great skateboarder [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7132.2s)]
*  That's a great and you really respected that person because of their craft [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7134.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and I feel like now it's like what kind of trainwreck will get the most views and clicks [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7137.84s)]
*  Okay, let's put that out there and then you have kids trying to recreate the trainwreck instead of getting really good at a thing [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7142.900000000001s)]
*  And yes when you know that it doesn't matter about being good [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7148.26s)]
*  It just a met it just matters how crazy the trainwreck is. Of course, you're gonna be nihilistic about it [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7152.26s)]
*  Why would you care? Yeah care at all. That's right. What's the split though? [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7157.3s)]
*  Because you started saying Gen Z is like the most hopeful generation and now you're saying well, there's listen [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7160.74s)]
*  There's hope in them in that I look at our absurdities and we do have a lot of absurd. Yes [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7166.72s)]
*  The worst version of them is black-eyed nihilist that don't care about anything at all. That's the fringes [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7171.5199999999995s)]
*  I think yeah, I think the best part of Gen Z is that they're appropriately skeptical of the institutions [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7177.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah that and they and they're not they they're raised. Yeah, it's like they don't need to learn like us [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7183.68s)]
*  We learn they look at big mama. They know big mama comes on with the cookie [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7189.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, and she takes out the whiteboard the boomers love it. They get excited. Yeah, that's our avatar. That's big mama [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7194.08s)]
*  Yeah, Katie's gonna come on and slap Jamie Diamond around. This is our [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7200.54s)]
*  Tuesday ritual. Yeah, the zoomers look at that and they know what it is. They know it's fake [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7205.5s)]
*  Yeah, they don't care. They laugh at it. They laugh at it funny. It's funny. It's entertainment. It's the way I look at it [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7209.94s)]
*  And I think that's the best version of them [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7217.1s)]
*  The worst version of them is running around and killing people in Arizona to give them credit [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7220.14s)]
*  There's stories of us killing who was a Matthew Shepard. I think when it was like the late 90s [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7224.68s)]
*  This dude is gay bunch of homophobic. Yeah, that was a meth thing that they've repurposed to be a homophobic thing. It was meth [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7230.099999999999s)]
*  Related. Oh, I'm very big into facts, but I'm sure they were homophobic as well [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7236.7s)]
*  It just so happens it was one of the there's more layers to it that being said [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7241.58s)]
*  I'm sure nobody was winning a progressive award. Yeah, we had our fringes that did crazy [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7245.56s)]
*  We had our friend. We had the trench coat mafia. Yeah, we had school shooters. We still do [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7250.48s)]
*  There's always gonna be I think that [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7256.04s)]
*  antisocial thing yeah [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7260.2s)]
*  But are these kids get you the machines are also big. Maybe it's not the kids in the future [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7262.76s)]
*  Maybe it's the machines. I feel like the zoomers would see a school shooter and like I roll [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7267.28s)]
*  They pick oh yeah, totally still happening. Oh, yeah [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7271.46s)]
*  Yeah, I mean the the the thing about the school shootings now is that they're not as effective as they were [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7274.0199999999995s)]
*  In the sense that society doesn't care there we go. Yeah [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7282.42s)]
*  They don't care society doesn't care anymore. No one cares. Yeah, it sucks and it might actually stop them [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7286.5s)]
*  That's what I'm saying like you're pouring gas and lighten yourself on fire. There you go [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7292.38s)]

*  No, they're not clean. They're not clear clean [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7577.26s)]
*  I just heard the bootlegger thing was because he was making clean. He was making like clean movies in Middle America. That's that was the business [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7580.54s)]
*  Was it the business? I I just think it's kind of well known that he well [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7587.44s)]
*  They certainly became friends with a lot of mobsters if they weren't bootleggers. What a fun coincidence [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7591.24s)]

*  You know at that level of society [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7603.88s)]
*  You're coming with a lot unsavory types, I'm not saying that the Kennedy's deserved anything that happened to them [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7606.54s)]
*  I'm just saying they're not an innocent family really so they're not just this innocent benevolent family [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7611.9800000000005s)]
*  That's just trying to save the Hudson no no they never were they were a ruthless bloodthirsty [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7618.18s)]
*  You know dynasty patrician blue blood cult that of course has some weird curses [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7624.74s)]
*  And they they threatened a lot of power factions that eventually hit back [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7630.16s)]
*  And that was not so they wouldn't play ball. They could have just rose to power, but another great American [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7636.5s)]
*  Name last yeah, JFK was a patriot. He loved his country [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7642.02s)]
*  he was [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7646.9400000000005s)]
*  certainly a guy who had [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7649.34s)]
*  Was a revolutionary guy in the sense that he believed that the American government should function in a different way [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7651.5s)]
*  Mm-hmm, and that ended up getting him killed seems like everybody who believes that kind ends up dying yes, but also those people [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7657.3s)]
*  You know aren't always there. They're not always their motives. You know are not always [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7664.88s)]
*  They make a lot of they make a lot of messes along the way yeah getting to yes [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7671.56s)]
*  Yes, okay back to Shane real quick amazing story. Yes, it's done. Yes [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7677.360000000001s)]
*  Kind of galvanized the comedy community to support SNL. Yeah, like we were kind of fractured with SNL [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7684.96s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a great story. I think people are supporting Shane. Yeah, he did an amazing job, and it's such a great story [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7691.94s)]
*  I think it's also so weird like the thing that you see like yeah like [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7697.9s)]
*  Also one thing that shocked me because I was you know he was in the city working out the yeah [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7702.46s)]
*  Yeah, the monologue and I've seen him do the monologue and just fucking crush every sign I saw him go up and the Down syndrome part [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7706.5s)]
*  I thought was the most endearing yeah hilarious, but like it yeah [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7712.34s)]
*  Really I literally was watching him do it of the seller and I was going when he goes up and he does SNL [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7717.400000000001s)]
*  Everybody in that building that ever doubted him or fired him is gonna feel like the biggest fucking piece of shit right right yeah and [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7723.64s)]
*  Just the fact and I thought we were beyond this point in comedy just the fact that he said Down syndrome [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7731.04s)]
*  Yeah, you could feel the audience fucking I think that's what was good about it. I actually think that to me [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7736.0s)]
*  I watch I thought it killed by and I also thought it did great what we good because here's the deal I think [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7741.72s)]
*  That should happen to an extent people should go what's going on, and then he's so funny. He overcomes any of that [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7747.64s)]
*  I think it's good. I think tensions good. I don't I don't see the building of tension the releasing it [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7753.16s)]
*  That's what comedy is I think it was [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7758.34s)]
*  Little different like it's New York City [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7760.72s)]
*  You know you're performing in New York City the middle of New York City and people might be a little like [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7762.72s)]
*  Yeah, but it's probably a crowd of people that might be a little bit a little bit more sensitive [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7767.84s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. I didn't realize that there was still I thought that we were beyond the point where no [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7772.76s)]
*  Can't talk about this, but there's still topics. I guess maybe in certain. I think I don't think we need to be in a place [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7776.64s)]
*  Where because I think our superpower if there is a superpower is making something funny that shouldn't be yeah [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7783.18s)]
*  I like that yeah, but now so it's so that to me [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7790.14s)]
*  That's the most fun time when you can't say anything you have fun time to do a comic for sure [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7793.34s)]
*  I do feel like we're entering a time where you can [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7796.5s)]
*  Say anything yeah, but that was a reminder to me like oh, maybe there's certain spaces for sure [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7798.62s)]
*  I really thought that that that part of it yeah, but they initially tightened up obviously end up winning them over, but yeah [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7803.26s)]
*  Even in the I couldn't believe it. It was been I [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7809.400000000001s)]
*  Was very invested in not liking this guy and now I have to reassess everything [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7813.08s)]
*  Because this is a guy who comes from I I had him painted as this bigot [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7817.16s)]
*  Who's from this certain type of family because it was the end of the set the beginning of said he's crushing yeah [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7820.52s)]
*  Oh, I thought the moment where he flipped everything it wasn't rocky by any stretch [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7825.320000000001s)]
*  But I could feel like things ascend when he was like started being like I can look at everybody not laughing to me right now [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7830.660000000001s)]
*  We kind of stepped outside of the set and then he closed. I thought it just crushed [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7836.34s)]
*  I think comedy. I think it's comedy. It's just sets or sets or sets yeah, you know that's really what it was a masterful set [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7839.14s)]
*  I think especially from monologue on that show yeah [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7845.06s)]
*  I also think the SNL audience like they know that it's being recorded. They know it's a lot [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7847.3s)]
*  Yeah, there's like a pressure on them [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7851.64s)]
*  Yeah, I want to air a little SNL in Russia and where I'm standing there, and then there's red lights on my chest [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7852.9400000000005s)]
*  And I just and I'm like and I say hello and Putin's there and everyone nods [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7859.92s)]
*  And I go it's great to be here [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7864.84s)]
*  And then like after every joke it's just a bunch of like [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7866.56s)]
*  Oligarchs and czars and they're all smoking cigars, and they're all just kind of looking at it [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7870.56s)]
*  And there's no left everyone just kind of looked at each other so that would be mine [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7874.160000000001s)]
*  That would be amazing for me, and then I just get through it, and they just kind of yeah [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7877.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah, really well. I absolutely was should have had you over there dude. It would have been a lot more fun. Yeah [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7882.04s)]
*  What would you have done when he starts doing the history lesson would you go ba ba ba ba I? [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7888.02s)]
*  Would I I think I think a little of the history lesson was good [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7893.06s)]
*  But I would have gotten to it been like what did you think of Prince Oleg piece of shit between me and you? [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7898.54s)]
*  What what do you think about all this stuff? [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7904.26s)]
*  Do you think these guys was there any gay activity? [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7907.54s)]
*  There was gay activity did you think there was any gay activity with Oleg? Let's be I hear Oleg [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7910.1s)]
*  We're talking this historian apparently Hitler big gay is that true or just very maybe not gay, but very welcoming of the gays [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0kZDIFpKtc&t=7916.06s)]
