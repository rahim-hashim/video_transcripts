# Bernie Sanders Rips DC Corruption, The Israel Lobby, & Reveals How Billionaires Buy Politicians
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo)
*  What's up everybody? Welcome to Flagrant. Our guest today is one of the only people in politics who hasn't traded [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=0.0s)]
*  conviction for convenience and somehow he is still here. For decades [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=5.76s)]
*  he has stood in the middle of the storm, unbought, unbossed, untethered, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=10.48s)]
*  saying what so many were too afraid to say, that working people deserve dignity, that health care is a right, that the system isn't broken. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=14.24s)]
*  It was built to screw you over. He has been mocked, sidelined, betrayed, and that's just by his own party. And still he shows up [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=21.04s)]
*  not for power, not for fame, but because he actually gives a damn. In a country drowning in cynicism, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=29.119999999999997s)]
*  he made people believe, maybe for the first time, that someone in Washington was actually fighting for them. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=35.839999999999996s)]
*  So please give a warm flagrant welcome to the last honest man in politics from Brooklyn, New York, Senator Bernie Sanders. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=41.44s)]
*  All right, let me get you out of here. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=49.92s)]
*  Let's go to the downhill. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=52.160000000000004s)]
*  Okay, I have a question, okay, listen and [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=55.04s)]
*  this is probably a sensitive topic. It might be too soon, actually. It actually might be too soon. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=58.72s)]
*  Okay, so if you don't want to answer, I totally understand. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=63.040000000000006s)]
*  In 1958, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=65.92s)]
*  I think you know where this is going. When Walter O'Malley. Oh god. I know. I know. This one cuts deep. When he moves [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=68.56s)]
*  the Brooklyn Dodgers to Los Angeles and he does it for corporate greed. Absolutely. And profits. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=77.52s)]
*  And he doesn't care about the community that built up that team. That's right. It broke a young Brooklyn boy's heart, probably many. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=84.16s)]
*  It seems like, and it could be a coincidence, that ever since then you've had it out for the billionaires. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=90.72s)]
*  Is that where it all started? I'll tell you something, two things. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=95.36s)]
*  There was a joke going around my neighborhood, Flatbush, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=99.2s)]
*  and what it said, the three worst people in modern history were Hitler, Stalin and Walter O'Malley. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  And not necessarily in that order. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  That was a joke. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  But you know what I did learn? In fact, he's the first. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=117.2s)]
*  You're kind of joking about the question. Yeah. But I'll tell you something. When you go up as a kid, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=120.88s)]
*  you have a thing called the Brooklyn Dodgers. Of course. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=125.2s)]
*  Brooklyn. Yeah. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=127.92s)]
*  So when you're a kid, the idea that it could be moved someplace else. It's insanity. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=129.84s)]
*  When you're a kid, you can't, that is privately owned, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=134.48s)]
*  run for profit and then it can be moved to California, was literally beyond your comprehension. Beyond my comprehension. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  So it was a real shock. And if you're asking me, did that have an impact [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=144.32s)]
*  on my political views? It did actually. It did. Because the Dodgers were a cohesive force [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=148.0s)]
*  in Brooklyn, bringing people together. Jackie Robinson, etc. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=154.0s)]
*  So yeah, that had an impact on me. Really? So it all starts there? I don't think it all starts there. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=158.32s)]
*  I learned something from that. But again, I mean, you think about it. He was [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=164.88s)]
*  something so important. Yeah. There's so many people. This guy didn't give a damn. Make more money. Let's go to California. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  And was it as simple as that? Like there was just a better deal out there? Sure. There was a huge market out there in California, right? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=175.44s)]
*  Right. Everybody, they can make more money. I think he starts baseball on the west coast. Yeah, he and the Giants guy. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=180.48s)]
*  That's right. That's right. And was it, I don't know, I mean, we have to get too much into it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  But I heard Robert Moses was pushing back a lot on rebuilding of a stadium. That could be bullshit. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=188.72s)]
*  It doesn't matter. That raises a whole other issue. But you know, sports and professional sports, all that stuff. But [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=193.68s)]
*  yeah, it was a big deal. That's your first exposure to corporate. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=200.08s)]
*  You know, what you're seeing today, and it's something we haven't looked at enough. It's something I want to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  is, it hasn't really changed. You have the, what is the function of professional sports? All of these teams are owned by billionaires. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=207.84s)]
*  And if Bolton-Wettel doesn't give you enough money, you're going to move someplace else and [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  no matter, you know, you break the hearts of kids, nobody cares. Can I ask you a question about that? Like, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=218.32s)]
*  why is it the city puts up money for these new stadium builds and we don't get any of the equity in the team? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=222.8s)]
*  Very good. Well, now you're raising another question. I was mayor of Burlington. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=228.64s)]
*  And Burlington, Vermont. We'd love everybody to visit us in Vermont. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=233.44s)]
*  And we had no professional baseball at all. I got elected way back in 81. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  I said, one of the things that I wanted to see if we can bring back. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=241.68s)]
*  That's how you silence Bernie. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=248.72s)]
*  But could we bring professional baseball? So we got to work on it [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=251.2s)]
*  and we ended up getting a double, I think it was a double A team, very good team [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=255.68s)]
*  in the Cincinnati Reds for its size. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=261.92s)]
*  And we [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=265.36s)]
*  were talking hard [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=266.96s)]
*  about how we can municipally own it. And we actually love it. Yeah. And we would have put public money into it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=268.96s)]
*  It would have been we would have made money off of it and all that stuff. We ended up losing it on the city council, but [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=274.88s)]
*  it was an effort that we tried to make. Anyhow, we brought the team in. It was really good for the community. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=279.12s)]
*  But years later, they left it, etc, etc. But the idea that [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=283.28s)]
*  taxpayers are putting huge sums of money, hundreds of millions of dollars, their school systems are falling apart. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=288.94s)]
*  They're putting billions of dollars or huge sums of money to build these huge stadiums. These guys make a fortune. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=293.28s)]
*  And then, you know, ten years later, they move out. And there's this excuse that they all use. They're like, yeah, but we're providing jobs. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=299.52s)]
*  It's like, yeah, so you can have a business that functions. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=304.56s)]
*  You can't have a basketball team that functions without people working there. And maybe jobs are part-time low paying jobs, by the way. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=307.52s)]
*  Right. So it's yeah, this whole thing of professional sports owned by a small number of very wealthy people is something that [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  ends. What's the irony? You want to go to a Red Sox? We go to Red Sox games. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=320.15999999999997s)]
*  Humphries is the cost of a family. If your husband, wife, two kids. Hundreds of dollars. Yeah. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  You buy a Coca-Cola, it costs you five bucks, ten bucks, whatever it is. I mean, that's kind of crap. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=329.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean, when I was a kid going to Edmonds Field in Brooklyn. You remember Edmonds Field? Do you know what it was? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=334.08s)]
*  No, no, I'm a little bit younger than you. Yeah. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=338.71999999999997s)]
*  I call myself a New Yorker. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=342.48s)]
*  Yes, of course. Yes, yes, yes. You were kidding me. All right. Absolutely. So we used to sneak in and get 60 cent, you know, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=346.48s)]
*  sending the bleachers. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=351.52s)]
*  And during that period, you know, a family could go to a game. Yeah. And now it's, you know, pretty on. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=353.12s)]
*  Yeah, and that's unfortunate. I really, there's great athletes out there. People want to see them. Yeah. Can't afford it. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=358.96s)]
*  And also in that time you saw Jackie Robinson play. Is that true? I did. I remember. Yes, I did. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=363.68s)]
*  What was the energy like in the stadium watching Jackie Robinson? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  I remember what I remember about him when he was older. Different Brooklyn back then. Yeah. What we used to do [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=371.28s)]
*  is hang out [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=376.64s)]
*  after the games to see if we got autographs. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=378.72s)]
*  And I remember him coming out. He had problems with his ankle or his foot or something. He came out holding his shoes. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=381.84s)]
*  How'd you know it was Jackie Robinson? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=387.6s)]
*  Oh, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=390.71999999999997s)]
*  odd one. But the, I mean, you talk about impact as a kid. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=393.12s)]
*  We used to do, this is true. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=399.2s)]
*  I mean, the Dodgers were like your family. Yeah. So I can tell you today [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=401.52s)]
*  the Dodger lineup. How's that? Wow. Everyone here, Gil Hodges in first place? No. Jesus. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=405.76s)]
*  How many people do? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=414.4s)]
*  I told you the educational system is falling apart. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=417.12s)]
*  Gil Hodges is a great guy, very quiet guy. He coached the, he managed the Mets years later. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=426.15999999999997s)]
*  Junior Gilliam? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=432.24s)]
*  Nothing. Peewee Reese, short stuff. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=433.92s)]
*  He was, I think, very friendly with Jackie Robinson, right? Yeah. He really like took him under. Yeah, in the movie [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=439.2s)]
*  they probably played it up a little. But he came from Kentucky. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=443.44s)]
*  You know, it's the Southern and at that point a lot of racism. He befriended Robinson. Yeah. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=447.44s)]
*  Third base was Billy Cox, left field was Gina Mansky, center field was Duke Snyder. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=451.20000000000005s)]
*  Probably heard of Duke Snyder. Right field, Carl Ferrell, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=456.88s)]
*  Roy Campanella catching. A bunch of, so I can remember now, what's my part? I can't remember what happened yesterday, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=459.36s)]
*  but I remember that stuff from a long time ago because it was an integral part of your life. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=464.88s)]
*  Yeah. And what you remember, all right, the Dodgers are two games out of first place. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=469.6s)]
*  Preachero was pitching, you know, Robinson is batting, you know, 3-0-8 if he gets two hits. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=474.48s)]
*  We knew what the averages were. You learned arithmetic. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=480.64000000000004s)]
*  Through baseball. Yeah, absolutely. I could, as a kid, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=483.6s)]
*  most of the kids on the block could tell you how many games the pitchers had won. I think they were playing. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=487.84000000000003s)]
*  I think now we call that autism. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=492.16s)]
*  Okay, okay. Senator Sanders, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=500.40000000000003s)]
*  we've got a very interesting situation, especially this last election. You've spoken about a lot where it's like [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=503.6s)]
*  a lot of unions decide to not endorse a Democratic party. Some even endorse the Republican party. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=509.52000000000004s)]
*  If the Democratic party cannot win the votes of union workers, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=515.1999999999999s)]
*  who are they for? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=520.4799999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=521.92s)]
*  All right. Let's take a deep breath. You ready? Okay, I'm ready. All right. Here we go. Is it a fair question? Yeah. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=522.88s)]
*  It is a very fair question. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=528.4799999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=530.24s)]
*  Politics, you know, what politics, how politics is conveyed [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=531.3399999999999s)]
*  in the media is, you know, who's running for office, what Donald Trump said and all that stuff, and that's all important. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=535.5999999999999s)]
*  But if you take a deep breath and you think about real politics, serious politics, what's it about? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=541.52s)]
*  It's about three things, it seems to me. Number one, where are we as a country today? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=546.0s)]
*  And that seems like a simple question. It is not a simple question. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=551.04s)]
*  Okay, how did we get to where we are? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=555.28s)]
*  And equally important, where do we want to go in the future? Right? Yeah. Reasonable questions? Absolutely. All right. Andrew, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=557.4399999999999s)]
*  where are we today? We're in New York City, New York. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=563.6s)]
*  What do you mean, where are we politically? No, where are we as a nation? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=566.24s)]
*  What are the things that we should be looking at? If I ask you, how are we doing as a nation? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=571.68s)]
*  What is it, we're struggling financially? Good. That's right. Quality of life. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=575.6s)]
*  That's exactly right. And I think that there, we are dissolution with the institutions that should be supporting and protecting us. Excellent. All right. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=580.3199999999999s)]
*  All right. So that's right. All that's right. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=586.24s)]
*  So start off with, in one sense, we are the richest country in the history of the world, right? We have enormous wealth. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=588.56s)]
*  Is that wealth? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=594.24s)]
*  Does that wealth [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=596.08s)]
*  apply to the vast majority of the people? Absolutely not. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=597.76s)]
*  So unbelievably, and nobody talks about this, you ask me, we started off on the Democratic party. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=601.2800000000001s)]
*  The first thing you got to do is be honest with people and say, look, this is where we are at. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=606.0s)]
*  We can blame whatever you want, but this is where we are. We're here. All right. Then I'll acknowledge that. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=611.0400000000001s)]
*  So you're living in a country [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=615.9200000000001s)]
*  where 60 percent, let me underline that, 60 percent of people live paycheck to paycheck. Got it? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=618.08s)]
*  I grew up in a family that lived paycheck to paycheck. All right. Where paycheck to paycheck is living [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=624.72s)]
*  under enormous stress. How am I going to pay the rent? What happens to my landlord raises my rent? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=631.2s)]
*  What happens when my kid gets sick and I can't afford to take him to the doctor? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=635.9200000000001s)]
*  You know, what happens if my car breaks down? You know that [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=639.36s)]
*  significant numbers of people in this country, you have money, you don't think about it. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=642.86s)]
*  But if you don't have any money and your car breaks down and it's a thousand dollar bill to get it fixed, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=647.04s)]
*  and you can't afford it, you tell me what happens. All right. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=652.8000000000001s)]
*  Bottom line is you got millions and millions of people, working class people, lower income people, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=656.32s)]
*  struggling to put food on the table. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=662.62s)]
*  Okay, that is the first profound reality and the question we've got to ask is why is that in the richest country on earth? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=665.84s)]
*  All right, that's number one. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=671.76s)]
*  Number two, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=673.84s)]
*  you have a health care system. How's the health care system? You tell me. Got a greater health care system in America? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=675.84s)]
*  Well, what do you think? I mean if you can afford it, it's pretty good. That's right. Yeah, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=682.24s)]
*  I think that's a better way to look at it. That's exactly right. Yeah. All right. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=685.2s)]
*  If you got the money, you got the best health care system in the world. Yeah. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=688.4000000000001s)]
*  But most people don't. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=691.6800000000001s)]
*  How many nations [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=693.36s)]
*  do not guarantee health care to all people as a human right? Do you guys know? How many? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=695.12s)]
*  One major country. You live in it. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=700.1600000000001s)]
*  So here's the insanity. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=703.36s)]
*  We are spending twice as much per person on health care as most of the European countries. Guarantee free health care, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=705.12s)]
*  not to correct you, but we won't refuse care if you need it. Oh wait, we will. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=711.12s)]
*  Well, it's a little bit more subtle than that. Yeah. All right. Let's say [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=716.88s)]
*  you have a $10,000 deductible. Okay, not unusual. Yeah. Okay. You got sick. What do you do when you don't have any money? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=721.12s)]
*  I go to the doctor. I go to the emergency room. I say I'm sick. Yeah, but you go to the emergency room, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=730.24s)]
*  but you're not like it's not an emergency. They'll say I'm just a little bit of sick. I just avoid it. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=734.96s)]
*  That starts to fester. It gets worse. You've got it. And that actually probably causes more strain. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=739.28s)]
*  It does. You know what else results in 60 some the study from Yale was that 68,000 people here die [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=744.88s)]
*  precisely. You go talk to the doctor. Next time you go to the doctor, say are people coming into your office [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=750.88s)]
*  much sicker than they should be? Yeah. And the answer is yes, they are. And that's just avoiding co-pays. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=756.7199999999999s)]
*  Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Fair enough. So people do die by the large numbers. What about our educational system? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=761.8399999999999s)]
*  Psychologists tell us that zero through four most important years of emotional and intellectual [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=768.48s)]
*  development makes sense, right? Yeah. Okay. So we must have a great childcare system, right? Because [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=774.16s)]
*  we love our kids. We nurture our kids. We pay childcare professionals. Really, we appreciate [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=779.04s)]
*  them and respect them. We pay childcare workers McDonald's wages. Yeah. It's shocking. It's also [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=785.44s)]
*  shocking how much competition there is to get your kid into like a favorable preschool. Right. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=792.32s)]
*  Like you have to start lobbying these preschools at one year. My daughter is 15 months and already [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=797.9200000000001s)]
*  now you're like, he's like a pharma company. Exactly. Like you're kind of walking in, you're [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=802.8000000000001s)]
*  meeting people, they're exchanging pleasantries and it's all under this guise of I hope they accept my [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=807.6s)]
*  kid. Right. Because you have a massive shortage. Yeah. And if people don't have any money, it is [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=812.5600000000001s)]
*  really difficult. And so I don't know what it costs here in New York City. You know, in Vermont [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=817.68s)]
*  costs 15, $20,000. So, you know, just imagine you have two kids, forget it. That's right. But again, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=823.12s)]
*  take a deep breath and say, okay, if we as a nation understand that that's the future of America, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=829.52s)]
*  we want the best. You would say, okay, we're going to have really great teachers for them. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=836.0s)]
*  We'll treat these teachers with respect, pay them well. They're doing really important work. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=839.92s)]
*  Taking care of your daughter is important stuff. Okay. We don't. Public schools, I was talking to [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=843.76s)]
*  a principal in Vermont, in the southern Vermont, they're starting teachers off at $32,000 a year. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=850.2399999999999s)]
*  So kids, young people graduate school in debt. We're not getting the best and the brightest [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=857.52s)]
*  people. Do we respect, you tell me, do we respect education in this country? No, we don't really. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=864.7199999999999s)]
*  What do you mean by respected? Like that we say, man, you're going to be a teacher. Educators. I [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=871.6s)]
*  don't think educators get close to enough respect. We give them a lot of platitudes. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=877.12s)]
*  We don't treat them with respect. We don't feel the same way as if they're like [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=882.1600000000001s)]
*  some finance bro or something. Exactly. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just to that point, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=885.0400000000001s)]
*  take a look at it. Harvard college, one of the best colleges in America, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=889.52s)]
*  something like 5% of the graduates will go into education and they're not going into public [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=893.52s)]
*  education. Of course not. 50% will go to Wall Street. They'll go to consulting. You make a [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=897.84s)]
*  great point though, if college loans are so expensive, they don't even have a choice to go [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=903.6800000000001s)]
*  into education. Exactly. So is there some sort of system built in where like if you choose to go [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=908.24s)]
*  into education, that there's a way that the- The loan will be forgiven. Something like that. Yeah. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=913.6800000000001s)]
*  There are small programs. They have something like that. But that's a good idea. And again, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=919.2s)]
*  I'm not making this up. I'm sure there was some system like that, but I imagine like maybe [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=923.52s)]
*  back in your day, now that there was a version where like highly educated, not highly educated [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=927.84s)]
*  in terms of master's program, but like people that went to elite universities before they [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=934.08s)]
*  went and got their master's or their doctorate, spent some time educating. Was that commonplace? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=937.2s)]
*  I'm not sure. I don't recall that. But like if there was a way to incentivize that, that might be- [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=942.24s)]
*  Right. Of course. That's right. But what we have to do, give you an example. And what also bothers [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=947.52s)]
*  me is we don't look at what goes on around the rest of the world. We kind of think that we're [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=953.8399999999999s)]
*  an island unto itself. What we should be doing is what is working around the rest of the world. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=959.5999999999999s)]
*  So you take a country like Finland, to be a teacher is a big deal in Finland. Wow, you're a teacher. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=966.2399999999999s)]
*  It's like being a doctor in this country. People respect them. They're well-paid. They have a lot [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=972.88s)]
*  of autonomy, et cetera. But all that I'm saying here is that if you look at the fundamental [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=976.96s)]
*  institutions in America, healthcare, education, childcare, distribution of wealth in America, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=986.1600000000001s)]
*  we are not doing well. And it's important that we acknowledge that. So I mean, nobody, you talk about [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=999.36s)]
*  your very kind introductions and talking about things that others don't talk about. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1005.44s)]
*  How many people will talk about the reality that Elon Musk himself [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1010.0s)]
*  owns more wealth than the bottom 52% of American households? Is that a moral issue? Are we [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1013.7600000000001s)]
*  comfortable with that? It's a simple question. And there are some people who say, hey, yeah, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1019.6s)]
*  that's okay. It's a dog-eat-dog world. Elon's a brilliant guy. He's a hardworking guy. Other [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1024.48s)]
*  billionaires start their own companies. They're really bold and brave. Fine. They deserve it. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1029.6000000000001s)]
*  And if you are trying to get by on $40,000 a year, well, tough crap. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1034.72s)]
*  How do you think Elon feels about it? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1038.48s)]
*  I don't know him. I've only talked to him many years ago, so I don't know him personally. But [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1041.92s)]
*  I'll tell you what I do think. I think there is a new breed of uber capitalists out there [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1045.6000000000001s)]
*  really believe, and this is, and they write about this as well, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1054.8s)]
*  really believe that they are superior human beings. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1059.1200000000001s)]
*  You know what I'm telling you? This is the quote unquote high IQ guys who say, look, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1062.4s)]
*  we work hard, we're smart, we've started these businesses. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1067.8400000000001s)]
*  So the victor go the spoils. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1070.96s)]
*  Not only that. I think that's yes. It's a dog-eat-dog world. I made it. You didn't make it. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1072.64s)]
*  Hey, man, that's the way life goes. It's deeper than that. You have some writing on the far right, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1079.8400000000001s)]

*  This is we have the right. It's the divine, you know, used to be the divine rights of kings. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1100.8s)]
*  Manifest destiny. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1105.1200000000001s)]
*  Exactly. All right. Back in the 19th century, the 1850s, you know, I am the king. God made my family [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1106.48s)]
*  king. And sorry, you're starving to death, but that's the way life goes. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1114.24s)]
*  God told me my family rules. There was something about this. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1117.92s)]
*  It's quite interesting that I've seen lately and it's actually not lately. There's a trend [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1123.12s)]
*  with the ultra wealthy, which is upon their death. A lot of them have decided to give away [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1127.36s)]
*  their money, right? Some of them are some, some, okay. Some of the most prolific, right? And, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1134.72s)]
*  or as they get closer to death, they're like, our goal is to give away all our money. Okay. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1140.3999999999999s)]
*  Which, which seems to tell me that they think that there is an issue with them having all that money. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1144.8799999999999s)]
*  If they truly felt entitled to it, like it seems to me, it's an admission that they agree with you. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1151.52s)]
*  They're like, it's kind of wrong that we should just keep all this in our family. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1156.56s)]
*  We should probably not have it now. They're not, it's almost like Benjamin Franklin freeing [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1160.96s)]

*  leave it until, you know, I might need some shit and my back hurts, but what do I do? So when you [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1170.16s)]
*  see billionaires do that, right? Or this elite class that you're talking about do that. Is there [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1175.92s)]
*  a part of you that goes, you're getting it. Why don't you do that maybe 40 years earlier? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1181.1200000000001s)]
*  No. Okay. Look, I just, I mean, these guys are very competitive. They're smart. They're very [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1186.56s)]

*  middle of it. I work in Washington, DC. So you just using Musk again as an example. He's only one. I [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1217.5200000000002s)]

*  campaign finance system, which as a result of citizens United Supreme court decision, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1229.44s)]
*  allows billionaires to start super PACs. Can you really quickly just tell the audience [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1235.2s)]
*  exactly what it is? Cause I feel like we hear these words like citizens United and a lot of [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1240.0800000000002s)]
*  people like we just super PACs. Yes. We just kind of pretend that we know what it is. Okay. But [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1243.3600000000001s)]
*  I, uh, we have the first amendment that says your freedom of speech. Okay. So wealthy individuals [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1247.6s)]
*  and in a case called citizens United, I don't remember all the details, basically said, look, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1257.9199999999998s)]
*  we had at that point citizens United, I think is 15, 20 years, that decision from the Supreme [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1263.12s)]
*  court, Supreme court decision. So people go into the court and say, look, I have a first amendment [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1269.04s)]
*  right to tell the people of America how I feel about an issue or a candidate. Absolutely. I [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1274.08s)]
*  don't like Andrew and I want to spend $20 million on television ads, uh, telling people what a [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1280.8s)]
*  jerk he is. Okay. Making me feel like Jamal Bowman. All right. That's another story. All right. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1286.72s)]
*  And the Supreme court says, no, uh, we have campaign finance. There's campaign finance [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1293.12s)]
*  law, which limits the amount of money you can spend on a campaign. So there's already a law [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1299.44s)]
*  in place. There's a lot of legislation that you cannot do. That's what's, that's what citizens [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1304.0s)]
*  United did. It said the Supreme court ruled that billionaires that advertising is freedom of speech [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1307.6000000000001s)]
*  and I can, you can't limit my speech. So if I want to spend a hundred million dollars on TV ads, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1315.44s)]
*  I have the right to do it. They say, you're right. So the issue is democracy versus billionaires [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1321.3600000000001s)]
*  being able to spend unlimited sums of money. Supreme court went with that. And then the form [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1326.8s)]
*  it took was a, what's called a super PAC. You saw the organization Americans for freedom. Okay. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1331.6s)]
*  And billionaires can put as much money as they want into that, that organization that runs ads [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1338.48s)]
*  on television, it does political stuff. That's what it's about. So bottom line though, most importantly [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1343.44s)]
*  is if you are a billionaire, you can put as much money as you want into a super PAC. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1349.12s)]
*  And in Musk's case, he spent $270 million to help Donald Trump get elected president. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1356.56s)]
*  Do Democrats have billionaires putting money into super PACs? Absolutely. All right. What does that [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1364.24s)]
*  mean in real life? This is what it means right now. We're dealing with a bill called the [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1369.4399999999998s)]
*  reconciliation bill. It's a fancy Washington term for a very big bill, which I'll have a lot of [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1373.6799999999998s)]
*  stuff in it. In any case, if a Republican stands up and says, you know what, in the house of [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1378.8799999999999s)]
*  representatives, I don't like this bill because you know, it's giving tax breaks to very wealthy [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1384.8s)]
*  people and it's going to cut Medicaid and cut nutrition programs. It's a bad bill. What do you [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1388.96s)]
*  think happens the day after that Republican stands up and says, he opposes it? Those super PACs [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1393.76s)]
*  organize and they primary out those politicians. You got it. Exactly. Now, and how effective is [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1398.6399999999999s)]
*  that? It is enormously effective. If you have, sure. Right now you're Republican. Yeah. You got [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1403.28s)]
*  what? No, I don't mean you. I mean, in general. All right. So you have [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1408.3200000000002s)]
*  two elements. Trump is enormously popular within the Republican base. Elon Musk has unlimited [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1417.52s)]
*  sums of money. Right? Double whammy. Double whammy. So it is very hard for any Republican to sustain [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1423.44s)]
*  that. To stand up and authentically speak their mind. All right, guys, take a break for a second [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1429.52s)]
*  talking about these billionaires. You know, let's find a way where we can get invested in the system [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1433.6s)]

*  support me. They will have to take on APEC. You mentioned Jamal Baldwin. Yeah. That's what [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1616.6399999999999s)]
*  you're talking about. They spend like 15 or 20 million to get them out of there. This is [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1620.8s)]
*  up in Westchester too. You got it? Okay. Cori Bush in Missouri, St. Louis was defeated. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1624.64s)]

*  You know how you do it? How? This is rather amazing. Great question. You don't talk about [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1655.0400000000002s)]

*  usual negative advertising. Didn't talk about Israel. So this is quite interesting because if [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1684.08s)]
*  a group like if a super PAC was honest about what they were raising against, for example, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1689.12s)]

*  radioactive, which they might not exactly be. It is duplicitous. You're undermining the people, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1707.2s)]
*  and that's where you remove. Wow. That's a very good point. All right. I mean, I think they should [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1713.28s)]
*  not have unlimited amounts of money. The goal point is, hey, if that's what your goal is, be honest [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1718.88s)]
*  about it. And I say this with you because you raise money not from a few billionaires, but like you [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1723.6000000000001s)]
*  guys raise, what is it, Sunrise and then Democrat Justice or Democracy Just? There are these groups, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1728.16s)]
*  they're a little different than super PACs, but they are raising money on a grassroots level. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1734.88s)]
*  But you are being honest about what you're raising money for. Exactly. You're right. So your point is [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1738.88s)]
*  right. If somebody says, look, I love Netanyahu. I think they're doing a good job. You oppose him, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1743.6000000000001s)]
*  and I'm going to oppose you for that reason. Yes. Let's be honest about it. Exactly. But you know [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1749.2s)]
*  what? I think one of the reasons they don't do that, you know why? Because it wouldn't be supported. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1753.0400000000002s)]
*  That's right. So is there any solution beyond getting Citizens United overturned by another [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1756.8000000000002s)]
*  state? That's a great question, man. Thank you. You're asking really good questions. We'll work [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1762.8s)]
*  on that right now. And here is, without going too much into the weeds, we need to end Citizens [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1766.56s)]
*  United. That's not going to happen tomorrow. But what you can do is within the Democratic [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1774.24s)]
*  Party or the Republican Party, you can have rules that says you want to be the candidate of the [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1779.2s)]
*  Democratic Party. Well, guess what? You tell, and this is again tricky, you tell that you announce [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1784.4s)]
*  very clearly, you do not want any super PACs supporting you. And by the way, if super PACs [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1792.0s)]
*  support you for every dollar they put in, we're going to put another dollar in supporting you. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1798.32s)]
*  There are things you can do. We're going to run ads. We're going to offset it. We're going to. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1803.52s)]
*  Sorry, I have to ask this. I'm sorry. I hate to interrupt you. We have a question we want to ask [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1808.08s)]
*  about what happened to you in 2016 with this Bernie Bros movement, where your followers are [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1811.84s)]
*  seeing they have a racism problem, a massaging problem. Do you think that's a super PAC thing [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1817.92s)]
*  behind that? No, it was the Democratic establishment. That was the, you know, that was just, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1821.36s)]
*  they were sitting there. We had a lot of young people, we had people of color and, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1826.8s)]
*  and, you know, they create this kind of myth with the help of the corporate media and all that stuff. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1830.48s)]
*  You know, it's kind of interesting to that note is during this election, the podcast space, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1834.6399999999999s)]
*  which the Democrats largely avoided, they feel had some influence in the election. And they started [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1840.24s)]
*  to label us the podcast bros and said that we were sexist and we were racist and bigoted. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1848.0s)]
*  It's almost like it's the exact same strategy to get you out of there. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1854.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's what the liberal elite China does. They, they run away. Look, getting, again, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1858.64s)]
*  I would hope that everybody who's watching the program is that we as a nation have got to end [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1866.96s)]
*  all forms of bigotry, right? Yes. And I start off as, as a basic assumption. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1871.6s)]
*  Unless it's to your close friends, right? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1876.24s)]
*  Whether it's racism or sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, whatever it is. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1879.2s)]
*  But, and, you know, liberal Democrats talk about that all the time. And then you get to what we [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1884.56s)]
*  call identity politics. You're black, you're wonderful, you're tremendous, you're gay, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1889.84s)]
*  you're the greatest human being on earth. And rather than say, what do you, what do you stand [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1893.92s)]
*  for? Exactly. Okay, that's fine. Who cares? Yeah. What do you stand for? Yeah. You know, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1900.24s)]
*  is every gay person brilliant and wonderful and great? No, of course not. Everybody's human being. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1905.2s)]
*  So the issue is what you stand for, which gets you back to what we discussed earlier, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1910.0800000000002s)]
*  class politics in the sense of which side are you on? Are you going to stand with working families? [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1914.24s)]
*  Are you going to raise the minimum wage to a living wage or not? Are you going to guarantee, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1922.16s)]
*  fight to guarantee healthcare to all people or not? Are you going to demand that the wealthiest [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1927.8400000000001s)]
*  people start paying their fair share of taxes or not? Those are the issues. No one cares what [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1932.32s)]
*  color you are, what your gender is, et cetera, et cetera. I'm sorry. I do feel like vowing to [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1937.12s)]
*  stop taking super PAC money is a great first step, but also being an honest politician. You put up [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1942.8s)]
*  a bill to stop the sale of weapons to Israel and there's no amount of money AIPAC can spend to not [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1949.52s)]
*  get you reelected. And I feel if we had more honest politicians, yeah. Okay. Then courageous ones. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1955.76s)]
*  You raise it. This is a very interesting, this is a good discussion. Why are you shocked? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1961.92s)]
*  I'm shocked because I do not want to raise this. I'm not asking you questions that are not often [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1970.16s)]
*  asked. This episode has been promoted by Walter O'Malley's foundation. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1973.04s)]
*  It's a painful issue. I mean, because I deal with it every day in Washington. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1980.4s)]
*  This is the, you're running for office. If you in your heart understand what's going on in Gaza [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1985.44s)]
*  right now, and again, it's almost painful to talk about it. The United States is complicit in the [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1993.52s)]
*  starvation of children as we speak right this moment. Okay. Mass malnutrition, et cetera. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=1998.72s)]
*  And you say that's wrong, man. And I'm not going to give Netanyahu another nickel, but I know [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2005.2s)]
*  that the day I say that AIPAC is going to pour a huge amount of money. So what's the choice you [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2010.08s)]
*  have? The choice you say you have is, okay, they're going to throw a lot of money at me, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2014.96s)]
*  but I'm going to make this a major campaign issue. I ain't going to run away from it. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2020.8s)]
*  What do we stand for as a nation? And I'll tell you something, getting back to the democratic party, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2025.76s)]
*  what the democratic established from people was like, well, Gaza, yeah, it's an issue out there. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2030.6399999999999s)]
*  It's not the main issue. It's not the pocketbook issues, you know, more important. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2035.76s)]
*  Healthcare is more important. But you know what? I'll tell you this is my own view, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2039.76s)]
*  is what people have a sense consciously and unconsciously. If you are turning your back [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2044.48s)]
*  on starving children in Gaza, why the hell am I going to trust you on anything? [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2049.04s)]
*  That's a great point. Is that a fair point? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2052.48s)]
*  I think it's a very fair point. I think if you turn your back on starvation in general, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2054.56s)]
*  especially if you're complicit in it, I think that's where a lot of, at least voters feel [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2059.52s)]
*  like there is some sort of separation. And if you make them realize that there isn't, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2063.44s)]
*  right, if we are protecting or funding or rewarding this in any way, then you are [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2067.52s)]
*  complicit. But I think voters feel like they're too derivative from it. They're like, oh, well, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2072.64s)]
*  that's not exactly what I'm voting for. And I do think not to undermine those other issues, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2076.0s)]
*  but like I do think the what is it? The kitchen table issues or I think those are incredibly [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2080.0s)]
*  important. And I think the more that people are struggling internally in our country, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2084.7200000000003s)]
*  the less of a concern we have externally. So it is a tough balance. If you make your entire campaign [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2088.8s)]
*  about Gaza, the people in whatever small area that you represent will go, hey, listen, that's [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2096.2400000000002s)]
*  horrible. It's happening over here. We're struggling too. So don't forget about us. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2102.4s)]
*  You got it. You got it. So how do you balance those two? [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2105.6000000000004s)]
*  Well, that's what politics is about. I mean, you make it. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2107.92s)]
*  I feel like you've done it well. I feel like you talk way more about internal issues [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2110.0800000000004s)]
*  I do. than external ones. I do. And Gaza then becomes a moral issue [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2112.96s)]
*  that you cannot run away from. But at the end of the day, you know, we have to ask ourselves, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2118.64s)]
*  why are we all where we are? And it's the funny thing I was talking to my staff when we were [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2125.2s)]
*  driving in today and reviewing there was a I think was PEW. They do these. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2131.3599999999997s)]
*  The polls? Yeah, they do things. And they asked the question, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2137.04s)]
*  I may be a little bit wrong here, but they said they do it. And they say, are you better off today [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2139.68s)]
*  than somebody in your situation, middle class, whatever you are, or 40 years ago? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2144.88s)]
*  That's the question. Yeah. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2149.76s)]
*  What do you think the answer was? This is an insane statistic. I've seen this research. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2150.96s)]
*  They're like that people are making inflation adjusted the same way as they were making 50 [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2154.8s)]
*  years ago. I don't mean that. I don't even mean statistically. I'm going beyond that. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2160.08s)]
*  Are you better off than somebody? How do you feel? Do you think somebody in your condition [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2163.76s)]
*  was living better 40 years ago? Or are you living better today? [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2168.0s)]
*  I think the average person would say no. That's right. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2171.28s)]
*  That's an astonishing. Alright, so let's go through the economics of it. Then we'll go through the [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2174.16s)]
*  world issue. Economics. This is an amazing fact. And again, it's something that people don't talk [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2179.92s)]
*  about because you've got a lot of the Republicans want to make change. It's almost always the wrong [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2186.2400000000002s)]
*  kind of change. And the Democrats want to maintain the status quo, which is unsustainable. That's [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2192.56s)]
*  what the choices that people have. Yeah. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2197.52s)]
*  But sometimes if the status quo is horrible, any change looks better. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2199.84s)]
*  And I think that's why Donald Trump is the president. That's what I think a lot of Democrats [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2206.88s)]
*  don't understand. Like you've been very critical. We're lifelong. I can't speak to everybody, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2210.08s)]
*  but like I grew up in New York City, I'm a lifelong Democrat. And we were very critical [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2214.08s)]
*  of the democratic establishment. And it was through the lens of, hey, you're not addressing [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2217.44s)]
*  the concern to the people. And by doing that, we were framed in a way that I think, and we [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2221.44s)]
*  continue to be framed away. I think it was very unfair. Oh, you don't know nothing about being [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2226.32s)]
*  framed. I don't feel sorry for you. It's just a refusal to look in the mirror. That's exactly. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2230.0800000000004s)]
*  All right. Here's a fact. This is an astounding fact. Nobody talks about it. And this is the [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2240.56s)]
*  other thing. More important than anything else is people want to say, do you know what is going on [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2244.8s)]
*  in my life? And if you don't talk about that reality, no one's going to trust you at all. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2250.1600000000003s)]
*  Fact. But let's call people Latinx, Bernie. That's right. That's the issue. All right. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2254.88s)]
*  Over the last 52 years, I may be off a little bit here, but more or less I'm right. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2261.84s)]
*  Over the last 52 years, there's been an explosion in technology. This stuff that we're looking at [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2267.2s)]
*  did not exist. Every worker in America is more productive. Correct? Absolutely. Okay. Computers, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2273.28s)]
*  et cetera. How much have real inflation accounted for wages increased in that 52 year time? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2278.0s)]
*  Obviously with all of that worker productivity increasing, we must be making a lot more money. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2285.28s)]
*  Right? Nothing. Zero percent. Zero. Yeah. In fact, there's an argument it's a little bit less in real [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2290.56s)]
*  housing costs. Because TVs are cheaper. You think that you're living a more luxurious lifestyle. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2295.28s)]
*  Take a deep breath about that fact. What does it say? Meanwhile, during that same period of time, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2300.08s)]
*  there was a massive, according to Rand Corporation, not a socialist organization, [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2307.2799999999997s)]
*  there was a massive transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2312.24s)]
*  But Bernie, surely they're paying taxes on all that new profits they're making, right? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2317.6s)]
*  Right. But that is getting back to this important issue, which I kind of started, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2322.24s)]
*  what is reality? So if you're the average worker out there, you're seeing people on the top getting [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2327.4399999999996s)]
*  phenomenally rich. You're no better off. And by the way, the likelihood is your kid is going to [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2332.8s)]
*  be worse off than you are. Right? Yeah. That's a tough reality. Why is that? Who the hell is [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2338.32s)]
*  he even talking about? A, why is that? And B, what the hell do we do about it? I think that was the [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2344.0s)]
*  appeal of Trump as he appeared to be talking to us. Whereas Democrats are kind of condescending [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2349.92s)]
*  and ignoring it. Essentially, Democrats say, status quo is working okay. We're going to tinker [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2354.5600000000004s)]
*  around the edges to make a little bit of a change here. Trump says the whole system is broken. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2360.64s)]
*  I will fix it. Well, his solutions will make it worse. But he at least acknowledged that [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2366.16s)]
*  the system is broken. Democrats often don't. They don't acknowledge it. And there's a lot of [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2371.44s)]
*  finger wagging, or at least recently, I didn't feel that when I was growing up, but at least [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2375.2799999999997s)]
*  recently there's a lot of finger wagging. And then there's almost like this detachment from [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2378.56s)]
*  working class people, which is really sad because you'll see them echo certain sentiments. They'll [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2381.68s)]
*  be like, look, like look at the Biden stock market. And it's like, guys, 50% of Americans [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2385.92s)]
*  aren't even invested in the fucking stock market. Like, you're so detached from working class people, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2390.7200000000003s)]
*  you don't even know the talking points to make them feel good about the economy. So how do we [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2396.0s)]
*  lie to them? Probably. So what happened? How do we get here with the Democrat establishment? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2400.48s)]
*  It's a great question. And the answer is that we do know. And that is during the 70s, 60s, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2406.08s)]
*  Democrats caught on, then you can raise a lot of money from wealthy people. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2412.7999999999997s)]
*  And it gets back to the campaign financing and all that stuff. So you got a Democratic establishment [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2421.3599999999997s)]
*  now, which is funded by wealthy people. You have consultants who are really way out of touch with [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2427.52s)]
*  reality, who make a whole lot of money in campaigns. And the working class is ignored. Donald Trump [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2432.72s)]
*  comes along and says, you know, I care about you, which was a lie. I don't know if that's a lie. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2438.88s)]
*  I'd give pushback on that. I think that it has to be proven that it's a lie. All right, I'll prove it. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2445.2000000000003s)]
*  And you're right, I could look through the rose colored glasses, but the idea, I think that when [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2454.7200000000003s)]
*  people are struggling, anybody who goes, hey, I'm going to help you out. Like I'm sure when Obama, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2458.7200000000003s)]
*  I remember Obama, I remember the impact of Obama, he ran on reform and he ran on hope, right? Yes. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2463.44s)]
*  He ran on this idea of we're going to make it better for you. Instead of Kamala seemed to run [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2468.32s)]
*  on this idea like, hey, it's good. We're going to keep doing the exact same thing, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2473.44s)]
*  which is a losing strategy. You got it. So that was her bloody console. I mean, I know Kamala, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2477.6800000000003s)]
*  she's a friend. She's very smart. That was what her bloody consultants told her to say. I begged [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2482.32s)]
*  them. I'm just between you and me. Why can't she push back? Like, you're right. Look, there's no argument. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2488.2400000000002s)]
*  This is the problem I think a lot of voters had is like, they didn't even know if it was her. We [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2492.96s)]
*  didn't even know if Biden was president. We didn't even know if these were her talking points. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2496.64s)]
*  And we felt that over the last four elections, Democrats, we felt that we didn't have a say [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2500.16s)]
*  on who could be president. We talk a lot about the Republicans being autocrats and oligarchs and [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2507.2s)]
*  taking over democracy, but from the Democrat perspective, and I'm a lifelong Democrat, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2513.3599999999997s)]
*  I felt like the Democratic party completely removed the democratic process from its constituents. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2518.64s)]
*  And I think they need to have some accountability of that. No argument here. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2524.16s)]
*  I don't need for you. I wanted you to like, 2016, I was like, this is going to happen. This guy's [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2528.72s)]
*  going to do it. And it felt like they stole it from me. And I'll be honest, it broke my heart [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2533.84s)]
*  when you supported them. Look, but you have in the world that I live in, you got a choice. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2538.56s)]
*  And I mean, a lot of people, including my wife, agree with you, but you know, you're down to a [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2545.84s)]
*  choice. Is it going to be Hillary Clinton or is it going to be Donald Trump? Not a great choice. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2552.64s)]
*  But it ended up being him anyway. So why don't we burn it down? [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2557.04s)]
*  Well, because it's easy to say burning it down means that children are not going to have, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2561.52s)]
*  you know, food to eat, that the schools will deteriorate. People will not have healthcare. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2567.04s)]
*  I got it. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2570.72s)]
*  I'm an elected official. I got to represent the people. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2571.3599999999997s)]
*  That's fair. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2573.52s)]
*  And I can't turn my back on. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2574.0s)]
*  But then could we not also say if ostensibly there hasn't been a fair primary for the Democrats [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2575.2s)]
*  since 2008, are they not also a threat to democracy? We often hear. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2580.16s)]
*  Fair enough. That is, that is. Yeah, I'm not going to argue with that point. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2584.16s)]
*  And that's why I'm proudly an independent. What we're trying to do now, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2590.8799999999997s)]
*  and I will just reinforce the point both of you made. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2594.96s)]
*  The hatred that we felt in 2016, 2020 from the Democratic establishment, [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2601.2s)]
*  give you an example. We would do rallies and we have thousands of people, often young people, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2606.8s)]
*  people of color coming out, working class people coming out. They were great, full of energy. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2611.36s)]
*  And then we'd go to a Democratic party events. There'd be a few hundred people, mostly older, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2616.0800000000004s)]
*  whiter, wealthier. And you saw the clash. And they, the establishment did not want to open the door. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2622.32s)]
*  They hated the idea that all these people whose hands were a little bit dirty, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2630.1600000000003s)]
*  who didn't have PhDs or weren't wealthy. Imagine walking in, it's my party, man. You ain't getting [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2634.96s)]
*  in. We will fight you in the most ruthless ways that we can. And that's the struggle. Are they [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2640.8s)]
*  going to open the door or are they prepared to lose elections literally and maintain, go down with [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2647.44s)]
*  the Titanic. So that is- Do you think you're forcing the door open? Because it seems like [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2654.64s)]
*  that's what's happening right now. Exactly what we are trying to do right now. In the last month, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2659.84s)]
*  we have enlisted some, I think the latest 7,000 people who are prepared to run for office from [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2667.04s)]
*  school board to Congress. Not all of them will run, but they've shown interest. There are training [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2674.8s)]
*  programs that we're undertaking with other groups right now. And by the way, a good percentage of [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2682.08s)]
*  them don't want to run as Democrats. They want to run as independents. So do you sense from the [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2688.64s)]
*  democratic establishment that they're more willing to listen to people like you or are you guys just [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2693.12s)]
*  going to have to kind of take it by force and win elections? Are they more willing to listen to me? [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2697.68s)]
*  No, they're not. But they'll take on some of your ideas for salvation. They realize they can't ignore [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2703.44s)]
*  it. Orphan lip service. Yes, they will take on the ideas, but these guys, they want to protect what [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2708.64s)]
*  they have. So your question is a, you would say, look, okay. And by the way, Joe Biden, to his credit, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2715.76s)]
*  I know everyone beats up on Biden. But what Biden did, unlike Hillary Clinton did, is he and his [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2723.44s)]
*  people saw that we had a movement. And what he did is was prepared to put together task forces. We sat [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2729.6800000000003s)]
*  down with their people and we brought people like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and some of the strongest [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2738.88s)]
*  sit down with, with, you know, establish and come up with a program. A lot of what went into the [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2745.8399999999997s)]
*  American rescue plan, which got us out of the COVID pandemic economically pretty well, and some other [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2751.68s)]
*  stuff. So the Biden people were more open to sitting down understanding that we represented [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2757.2799999999997s)]
*  millions of people than other people in the past or are right now. I feel like most politicians are [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2763.2799999999997s)]
*  swayed by money and lobbyists and that like, I wouldn't say dictates, but it definitely influences [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2770.7200000000003s)]
*  their decisions. You feel like one of the last honest politicians. Can you tell me what other [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2776.88s)]
*  politicians have the Bernie stamp of approval that they're like honest? Yeah, who's that bought? [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2782.64s)]
*  Oh, there are a number of people. Look, one of the successes that we've had that doesn't get a lot of [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2787.92s)]
*  attention is in the House of Representatives now, there are dozens and dozens of young, [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2792.88s)]
*  often people of color, often women who are there. I mean, Alexandria is maybe the best known, [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2799.2s)]
*  but Pramila Jayapal from Washington state, Greg Kazah from Texas, Mark Buchan from Wisconsin. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2805.68s)]
*  There are many of them and they're doing a great job and they don't take corporate pack money and [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2814.7999999999997s)]
*  they stand up for the working class. By the way, guys, this episode has also been brought to you [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2820.3199999999997s)]
*  by Stake. Stake is the leader in global betting in US social casinos, bet on top sports and [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2824.48s)]
*  political events and use the promo code flagrant for your welcome bonus. We know we got the NBA [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2829.36s)]
*  playoffs cooking right now. You know that we're going to have some elections coming up. If you [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2834.72s)]
*  want to get busy and get some skin in the game, you know where to do it. Stake has got your back. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2838.4s)]
*  Remember, use that promo code flagrant for that welcome bonus. Now let's get back to the show. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2843.52s)]
*  Another form of, I think, corruption that many Americans see within both Democrats and Republicans [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2848.72s)]
*  is this idea of the stock trading. And they see that as kind of like another way to take some [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2854.32s)]
*  money off the top. And people have talked about Nancy Pelosi and her husband, for example, but I [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2860.7200000000003s)]
*  think it happens across the aisle. What is your take on that issue and is there a way to curb that? [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2865.1200000000003s)]
*  I don't own any stocks, so it's not my thing to follow it. I'm not sure that that has, [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2869.44s)]
*  you know, if the implication is that these members of Congress are aware what's going to happen [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2874.4s)]
*  tomorrow and are putting their stock, I'm not sure how, I'm sure it happens. I don't know how [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2878.56s)]
*  prevalent it is. But what was interesting, by the way, on that subject, as you may recall, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2883.6s)]
*  just was a month ago where Donald Trump said something like, what, today is a great day to [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2888.0s)]
*  invest in all the changes and views on the tariffs. Do I think insiders knew something about that? [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2893.2799999999997s)]
*  Probably. That felt awesome when he did that. I felt like a politician. Like I was privy to [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2899.2799999999997s)]
*  the information that I feel like Pelosi and Schumer are privy to and the Republicans do it as well. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2905.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't want to make it a partisan issue, but like it felt, I think a lot of Americans, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2910.64s)]
*  instead of rejecting this insider trading idea, finally felt like the train wasn't [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2914.4s)]
*  running away without them. We were on the inside. Exactly. Where it would be great if nobody did it. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2918.96s)]
*  That's the ideal situation. But I think a lot of times what we've seen is like this great [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2924.08s)]
*  frustration with government and then whoever pulls the veil off, there is an appreciation of it [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2927.8399999999997s)]
*  rather than a rejection that there is corruption in general. All right. Let me ask you a question. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2934.0s)]
*  Do we talk enough about where we want to be as a nation? I think culturally, what Trump represents [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2940.8s)]
*  to me, he lies all of the time. He is interested in himself and more money. Almost what bothers me [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2948.16s)]
*  is that is the kind of culture that we advertise to young people. This is the world. If you lie [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2957.84s)]
*  and you cheat and you steal, you sue someday can be a multi-billionaire. Is that where we want to [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2964.48s)]
*  go as a nation? And what's the alternative? I think the most important question is what do we [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2971.04s)]
*  want as Americans? I think the way that we teach in school is that people came here for freedom. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2974.96s)]
*  I think if we were being more honest, I think people came here for money. I think it was [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2984.8s)]
*  freedom from a lack of opportunity. There was freedom from oppression. In other words, my mother [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2989.84s)]
*  is an immigrant. Where did your mom come from? Scotland. She didn't have maybe a lot of opportunity. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2993.36s)]
*  She stopped going to school at 15 years old, came here to America, started a dance school, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=2999.6800000000003s)]
*  and she had immense success here teaching dance lessons in New York City. Who would have thought? [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3003.6s)]
*  I think the reality is that opportunity. I think Akash's family also came here for financial [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3009.36s)]
*  opportunity. My family as well. Exactly. I think it's very hard to tear that away. I think that [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3014.08s)]
*  the fuel of the American machine is this idea, the delusional hope that one day we'll all be [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3019.36s)]
*  millionaires. I don't know if that's right, but I think that is. Look, this city is what the [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3027.36s)]
*  melting pot city in a sense. My father came from Poland. He dropped out of school at 14. He came [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3037.6800000000003s)]
*  here at the age of 17, really incredible without any money. That's the story of millions and millions [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3043.36s)]
*  of families. We all came different ways. But what I'm getting at is should the goal, and everybody [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3047.92s)]
*  wants to live comfortably. There's nothing to be ashamed of. You have to worry about whether you [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3054.16s)]
*  can pay the electric bill. You want to make sure your kids get an education. But does the culture [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3058.88s)]
*  have to suggest that to be a success, you need to be a billionaire? What I'm getting at is, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3064.8s)]
*  I'm the former chairman of a committee that deals with all this stuff. So we don't have enough [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3072.2400000000002s)]
*  doctors in America. We don't have enough nurses. We don't have enough dentists. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3076.24s)]
*  I brought in several billion dollars into the state of Vermont for infrastructure, [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3080.0s)]
*  to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. We did that all over America. We don't have enough [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3083.9199999999996s)]
*  construction workers who make good money, by the way. You want to be a sheet metal worker, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3088.56s)]
*  you want to be a welder, you want to be an electrician. We don't have enough. What I'm [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3092.4799999999996s)]
*  saying is, I would like to see us say, you want to make America great? Good. I want to have doctors [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3097.04s)]
*  so you can have to wait two months to get into a doctor's office. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3102.56s)]
*  It's so important. It's like, what does the culture award? I think Akok can speak on this, [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3107.36s)]
*  maybe the best of all of us. Within your community, what is the highest? [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3111.44s)]
*  Doctor. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3115.7599999999998s)]
*  It's doctor. Doctors will make the most money. There are hedge fund managers that make more money. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3116.48s)]
*  But if they're in a group, like you speak to it, if you're in the family gathering. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3120.56s)]
*  There's an honor. I get to brag to my parents, get to brag to other friends. My son is a doctor. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3123.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't even know if it's about helping people. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3130.2400000000002s)]
*  That is the thing. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3134.32s)]
*  It's not the most lucrative profession. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3136.88s)]
*  It's not. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3138.32s)]
*  But it garners the most. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3138.7200000000003s)]
*  My dad told me, he was like, I'm really proud of your success. I'm proud of how far you've come. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3140.4s)]
*  I want you to know no matter how famous you get, I would still rather you be a doctor. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3144.4s)]
*  So maybe there's a version of that in America where obviously we want financial success, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3149.76s)]
*  but can we reward some of these other positions as they offer societal utility? [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3154.32s)]
*  Right. And then you go even deeper than that. And that is, now you're going really deep. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3159.44s)]
*  You get into the issue of human happiness. These guys sit in Wall Street, they get up [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3166.96s)]
*  four o'clock in the morning to see what the stock market is in Japan and they make [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3172.2400000000002s)]
*  zillions of dollars doing crap. I mean, what's the usefulness of the society? [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3175.92s)]
*  And you've got a kindergarten teacher here in New York City who is nurturing [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3179.92s)]
*  and making life better for some low-income kid. Who's doing more important work? [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3184.56s)]
*  I mean, the teacher, without a doubt. There's no question. The problem is that we're not rewarding [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3188.48s)]
*  those positions. And if we did reward them, like if it was this great honor to hold these [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3192.6400000000003s)]
*  certain positions, which I still do think doctor is, but I think there are few and far between, [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3198.2400000000002s)]
*  and first of all, doctors make a lot of money, so let's not act like they don't, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3204.6400000000003s)]
*  but I think there are few and far between positions that don't make a lot of money, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3207.12s)]
*  but still command immense respect in America. I do think that we are tied to the dollar, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3210.4s)]
*  unfortunately. And how do we change that? That's exactly the question. I want, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3215.6s)]
*  I want, I mean, again, getting to the, it seems to me, you know, you talk to, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3221.12s)]
*  I'll tell you, so we do a thing in Vermont, it's called the Bernie Buzz. It's a newsletter that [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3226.16s)]
*  goes out, did a interview with a woman who works in a nursing home. God knows what she makes. It's [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3229.52s)]
*  not a lot of money. Okay. And she talked about her satisfaction helping seniors fixing their hair, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3235.28s)]
*  the women getting their nails and all that stuff. And the pride, she's a religious woman. Okay. And [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3241.0400000000004s)]
*  the pride she had and how she feels good. I want us to feel good about doing good stuff. Yes. Not [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3245.92s)]
*  just ripping off other people. I don't want to be, ah. But the problem, the problem is much deeper [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3253.76s)]
*  than a Donald Trump to give some pushback. Yes. Gordon Gekko is celebrated as a hero. Exactly. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3258.0s)]
*  I grew up listening to rap. I still love it, but it's all about excess wealth, being rich, [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3262.96s)]
*  being billionaires. It doesn't matter how you get the money. Doesn't matter if it's honorable or [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3267.92s)]
*  not. When we were growing up, there was a million movies about, and there's a lot of criticism for [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3271.92s)]
*  this, but like some teacher who's well off that goes to the hood and really commits to like [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3276.48s)]
*  revitalizing that school. Right. And initially the teacher's not accepted, but then the teachers see [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3280.88s)]
*  that, so the kids see that he's like a good, or she's like a good force on humanity. And it's [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3285.6s)]
*  really rewarded. I don't think they make those movies anymore. I think it's a bunch of Gordon [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3289.76s)]
*  Gekko's, right? Or every Marvel movie is about, you know, in Elon Musk's character type, which is, [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3295.6000000000004s)]
*  you know, Iron Man is Tony Stark. So yeah, the culture is clearly rewarding whatever makes you [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3302.5600000000004s)]
*  money. And I don't want us to completely get away from that. I think like success is important. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3307.6800000000003s)]
*  Ingenuity and innovation is important. Absolutely. But there has to be something else that's [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3312.4s)]
*  important. Exactly. That's what I'm saying. So how do we do that? How do we instill that? [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3315.92s)]
*  That's the kind of girl's got to start sleeping with teachers. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3319.92s)]
*  This is the kind of discussion we need to have as a chain. It gets back to this thing, you know, [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3323.44s)]
*  this, this blew me away. This, uh, Puel poll about whether you feel better off and it's like, [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3327.36s)]
*  we got diverted a little bit. It's not just economics, whether you're better off inflation [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3333.12s)]
*  account for dollars today than you were 40 or 50 years ago. It's, it's more than that. It's, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3338.72s)]
*  do you feel part of your community? All right. Uh, or are you feeling isolated and alone? Are you [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3345.4399999999996s)]
*  spending half your time on a goddamn cell phone? Yeah. Right. Um, and you know, how do we, I mean, [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3353.4399999999996s)]
*  the, the, the, the craziness is we have more potential wealth now with all of this exploding [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3361.6s)]
*  technology. So we don't have to be working 50 or 60 hours a week. We can be thinking about how do [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3368.0s)]
*  we, what does it mean? Hey, should we be dealing with the economic issue? Should everybody have a [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3373.6s)]
*  decent standard of living in America? Can we do that? Answers? Yeah, we can. Do you think [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3381.28s)]
*  it's realistic to effectively tax billionaires in a way that still encourages innovation within [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3385.28s)]
*  America? Yeah, I do. I happen to believe that we should not have billionaires. All right. So you [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3391.76s)]
*  want to get rich, fine. Get rich. How much do you need? All right. Yeah. So I would have a very [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3396.7200000000003s)]
*  steep. Not here. 99 million. Something like that. Maybe 900 million. But we want to change the [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3401.76s)]
*  culture around. You know, I talked to Bill Gates, did an interview with him on Netflix, and I said, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3410.56s)]
*  Bill, you know, you're worth a zillion dollars. Were you motivated as a young man with the dream [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3416.72s)]
*  that you become? No, I love computer program. That's what I loved. That was his passion. Then [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3421.68s)]
*  he ended up making huge amounts of money. So, you know, I don't begrudge people making a lot of money, [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3427.2s)]
*  but I think there is, should be a limit to how much you make. And also, and then getting back to [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3431.92s)]
*  economics is we're looking at a nation today, not only with massive income and wealth inequality, [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3437.52s)]
*  but incredible concentration of ownership. What are your effect? Yeah. You got three [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3442.56s)]
*  Wall Street investment firms, BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard. Vanguard, yeah. Who [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3448.4s)]
*  combined, combined are the major stockholders and 95% of corporations in America. Go look at [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3455.2000000000003s)]
*  your favorite corporation, see who owns it. It'll be one of those who's the major stockholder. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3460.8s)]
*  They'll be there. What do you think about that? That's power. What is the impact of that? Like, [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3465.84s)]
*  how does, how does that power wheel? It means that you have three entities with boards of directors [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3470.0s)]
*  who have significant control of every major corporation in America. What that means is, [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3476.6400000000003s)]
*  do they stay in America? Do they go abroad? Do they pay their workers a decent wage or [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3481.28s)]
*  they treat them like crap? That's what it means. Enormous power in the hands of three Wall Street [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3485.44s)]
*  firms. So what's interesting is when you start to get any kind of money, they'll tell you, [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3491.84s)]
*  open your mind. Put your money in a Vanguard. Yeah. Is that good for America? Because it seems [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3495.44s)]
*  like to us, oh, this is how you get to participate in capitalism. Right. That's right. That's your [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3500.48s)]
*  retirement goes into Vanguard. But that's one thing. But the other thing is that Vanguard, [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3504.32s)]
*  State Street, and BlackRock have enormous economic power, which is not a good thing. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3508.8s)]
*  And they're not using it benevolently. They're not. They're using it to make more money. So the [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3514.48s)]
*  issue is that we got to take a look at, is we got to ask questions that I got to tell you [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3518.4s)]
*  in Congress is very rarely asked and in the media is very rarely asked. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3524.72s)]

*  Americans, yes and no. Some people will say, no, hey, it's a tough world out there. I'm sorry. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3534.0s)]
*  I'm smarter than you. I work harder. My dad gave me a lot of money. You don't have it. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3539.9199999999996s)]
*  Tough crap. At least they're honest. Yeah. That's what some people will say. Most people will not [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3543.52s)]
*  say that. Right. Most people say, you know what? Yeah. I don't think anybody should be sleeping [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3548.24s)]
*  un-understand. I don't think anybody should not be able to go to a doctor. That's what most people [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3552.4s)]
*  say. Okay. What does that mean in terms of practical politics? It means among other things [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3556.0s)]
*  that we need an educational system, which is very strong from childcare to graduate school. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3564.0s)]
*  All right. You want to become, I know your dad wants you to become a doctor, but if you want to [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3568.64s)]

*  you want to be a doctor, you want to be a nurse, you want to be a dentist, we need you desperately [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3582.4s)]

*  subsidize it. Absolutely. If we need more engineers, don't make the education so expensive. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3591.6s)]
*  Exactly. We need it. And we need more engineers. And also, I wonder if there's a certain point in [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3595.68s)]
*  time where if you squeeze the consumers of your products so much, they won't be able to buy them. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3599.6s)]
*  So isn't it in the best interest of these, you refer to them as oligarchs, but isn't it in the [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3604.3199999999997s)]
*  best interest of these oligarchs that they make sure that life is fruitful enough for the people [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3609.28s)]
*  that are going to consume their products? That's a very good question. And I'm not sure that [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3614.88s)]
*  that's a legitimate question. I think a right question. I don't know that they think about it. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3619.52s)]
*  They talk about the markets all the time, but it's like the market's going to decide for you, buddy. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3623.76s)]

*  smarter than me to figure out, but there is some way allowing people- Slightly more equitable. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3637.44s)]
*  Yeah. It's just like making enough money. And I don't know if Henry Ford did this, but of course, [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3642.4s)]
*  in the lore you always hear, everybody on the line could afford a car. You would like to believe that [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3646.32s)]

*  Good. And that is the honest debate that we should be happy because the country- [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3662.4s)]

*  they're just nepo babies. And I'm curious your thoughts on the nepo babies, the trust fund kids [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3677.12s)]
*  who have taken a long life, taken up politics and are finger wagging at people who actually work for [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3682.96s)]
*  a living when they've never had a real job. I'm curious your take on them being so opinionated. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3688.48s)]
*  Well, I echo what you're saying. Some of these folks were born with huge amounts of money, [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3694.16s)]
*  think that they have the right to be telling everybody else what they can be doing and [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3702.72s)]

*  we want the least calories, and we want no sugar. And David already figured it out. They hacked it. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3764.08s)]
*  It's done. It's right here. I'm telling you about it. You're not gonna find a better one. Oh, by the [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3768.56s)]

*  150 calories and zero grams of sugar. You think something with this protein to calorie ratio would [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3776.7200000000003s)]
*  make you sacrifice on taste, right? No, not at all. I mean, this one right here is absolutely [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3782.08s)]

*  Now let's get back to the show. I want to bring it back to something you mentioned and you mentioned [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3813.12s)]
*  the hyperinflation of college tuition is something that you don't hear talked about a ton. But growing [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3816.88s)]
*  up in a family where the more degrees you have, the more respected you are, it seems as though [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3822.8s)]
*  it's getting to the point where you brought up where the product is not worth the cost. College [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3827.44s)]
*  having an undergraduate degree, it's not worth how much you're going to make in the long run. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3832.32s)]
*  If we're not at that point, we're getting very close. Is there a solution to that? What would [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3835.92s)]
*  you say to that? I would love to hear your thoughts on that. Well, I happen to think [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3839.76s)]
*  that education itself is something that should be a lifelong pursuit. My wife tells me this every [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3844.0s)]
*  day. I don't mean to be romanticized, but learning is a pretty good thing. I tell my [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3852.8s)]
*  grandchildren that. School sometimes almost discourage them from learning. They've got [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3862.4s)]
*  rote things. I hate school, grandpa. So I think learning is important. I think we probably have [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3867.76s)]
*  this day and age revolutionized education. But I personally believe in my soul is if you want to [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3874.3999999999996s)]
*  get a graduate degree, we need you. And you shouldn't be going in debt. There should not be [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3883.4399999999996s)]
*  impediments. You've got to figure a way to fund it. But bottom line is anybody. I want to say to [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3889.52s)]
*  every kid in America, you're interested in physics, you're interested in science, you're interested in [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3894.3999999999996s)]
*  engineering. You're going to do it. I don't care what your income is. We will in one way or another, [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3899.12s)]
*  you're going to achieve that. And you know why? Because as a nation, we need you. You hear a lot [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3903.04s)]
*  of these people saying, especially folks that are attached to these big corporations, like America [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3907.92s)]
*  doesn't have enough engineers. America doesn't have all these things. So we have to go higher [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3914.8s)]
*  abroad. It's like, well, I don't know, maybe if you had access to billions of dollars or something [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3918.56s)]
*  that you could do to make sure that we could grow them here. Now, I'm not putting that 100% on them, [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3922.48s)]
*  but you would hope that there would be some sort of benevolence that would recognize a problem here. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3926.88s)]
*  Not benevolence, it's self-interest. So reward their own selfishness. We need engineers. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3930.64s)]
*  In case you haven't heard, there is a climate crisis. How do you transform our energy system? [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3942.24s)]
*  Easier said than done. We need some really, really smart people to figure out how we create cheap, [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3948.3199999999997s)]
*  sustainable energy. Right? Yeah. All right. I will send you to graduate school. Thank you. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3953.68s)]
*  Daily. Yeah. He needs it badly. We need you. And that's what we should be thinking about as a nation. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3958.3999999999996s)]
*  As far as subsidizing that, do we have room in the budget? And where is the best place to pull it? [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3964.3999999999996s)]
*  Subsidize. What does that mean? We're subsidizing this bill right now, the so-called reconciliation [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3969.04s)]
*  bill, Trump's big, beautiful bill. We got 200 in the House, the Republicans winning in $235 billion [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3973.2799999999997s)]
*  over a 10-year period to go to the top two-tenths of 1%. So if your billionaire father is going to [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3983.04s)]
*  leave you money, the exemption is now up to a married couple of $30 million that you don't [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3991.44s)]
*  have to pay any taxes on. So this goes to the top two-tenths of 1%. Do we have enough money? [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=3997.12s)]
*  This is what you got to get in your head. We have enough money in the country to do any [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4003.8399999999997s)]
*  goddamn thing you want to do. In this particular budget, we're now spending a trillion dollars on [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4009.12s)]
*  the military. They want to spend 150 billion more. We're spending more than the bottom, [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4013.68s)]
*  the next nine nations combined. So what we're doing is giving tax breaks to the rich, spending [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4019.3599999999997s)]
*  more money on the military, and then we're going to cut Medicaid. So the way in this country, [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4024.24s)]
*  literally, and by the way, when I say these things, they're not radical ideas. All right. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4030.08s)]
*  How much does it cost to go to college in Sweden? Nothing. Oh, wow. No kidding. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4035.2s)]
*  But that must be the healthcare system is really expensive, right? It must be. Yeah. How much does [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4041.04s)]
*  it cost to have healthcare in Sweden? Nothing. Oh my God. Nothing. Childcare must be really off the [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4045.12s)]
*  wall. In other words, if you start off with a value system that says we're going to use, [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4050.7999999999997s)]
*  and there are rich people in Sweden, believe me, but it's a value system that says, look, [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4057.4399999999996s)]
*  we're in this together as a people. We want the best educated people. We want our kids to do well. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4062.72s)]
*  We want everybody to have healthcare for a lot of reasons. Sweden does it. Norway does it. Finland [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4069.2s)]
*  does it. The pushback we often hear is the population in America is too big to support this. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4074.96s)]
*  Is that true? That is just, that is the pushback. And we're a multicultural, multiracial, [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4078.8799999999997s)]
*  and they're kind of a homogenous. Yeah. So what? We're richer than they are, as a matter of fact. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4086.0s)]
*  Well, Norway is particularly rich. They have a lot of oil money, but we can do it. So here's my [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4090.24s)]
*  suggestion for that. I think if a single state provided universal healthcare, let's say, for [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4095.2s)]
*  example, Vermont, and they proved that it could be done, they would put so much fucking pressure [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4103.5199999999995s)]
*  on every other state to do it. It's like legalizing weed. Yeah, exactly. We've seen it happen with [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4109.84s)]
*  weed, right? Like one state does it, starts to make a lot of other states, oh, maybe we should do it. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4114.24s)]
*  People are only incentivized by their own salvation, unfortunately. How do we prove that? [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4118.0s)]
*  Which state is going to go make it happen for them and then make New York look embarrassing? [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4122.48s)]
*  We have all this wealth and we can't provide healthcare to our citizens? Well, I think you [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4126.72s)]
*  make a very good point. The problem is the people in the insurance industry and the drug industry [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4131.44s)]
*  understand that as well. So they're not dummies. They understand, oh, geez, Vermont managed to [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4137.76s)]
*  provide free healthcare to all of their people that will become a model for the rest of the [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4143.12s)]
*  country and we're up the creek. So they fight it tooth and nail. And how do they fight it? Like, [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4149.28s)]
*  for example, what are they doing? Oh my God, Jesus. In a small state, you buy the, you know, [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4152.4s)]
*  you just have lobbyists there up the kazoo and put advertising on. I ran it. Look, I am an advocate [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4157.04s)]
*  of what we call Medicare for All, expanding Medicare to cover every man, woman and child in [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4164.0s)]
*  the country. All right. Oh, and the argument we had 30 second ads, Bernie Sanders wants to raise [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4168.72s)]
*  your taxes outrageously. Take away the health insurance that you have. Well, what they forget [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4176.16s)]
*  to tell you is that you're not going to be paying any more out of pocket, any more deductibles, [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4182.88s)]
*  any more premiums. You're going to get higher wages because your boss doesn't have to spend [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4187.92s)]
*  a fortune on healthcare to cover you. They forgot to tell you that. That's like your taxes go up [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4193.04s)]
*  six grand, but your healthcare yearly costs goes from 12 grand to zero. So you just save six grand. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4197.12s)]
*  All right. And the health care says a little bit going on that one. We're spending twice as much [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4203.84s)]
*  per capita as the people in Sweden who have a better health care system. The way that why, [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4208.5599999999995s)]
*  well, maybe coincidentally insurance companies, you know, made, what did they made? A hundred, [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4213.04s)]
*  I think it made 70 billion last year. Drug companies, the charges, the highest prices [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4219.76s)]
*  for drugs made a hundred billion. So it is a healthcare system designed to make [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4224.24s)]
*  what drug companies and insurance companies. How do you keep the quality of insurance, sorry, high [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4228.719999999999s)]
*  or quality of healthcare high? Because anecdotally, I hear from people in the UK and Canada, [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4233.5199999999995s)]
*  their healthcare is not very good because it's, I guess, subsidized. UK is under a lot of pressure [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4237.5199999999995s)]
*  right now. And that's true. And that's, that's a political decision. They got the same factors that [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4243.12s)]
*  would impact the state. The big money interests are putting a lot of pressure trying to destroy [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4247.92s)]
*  the UK healthcare system and its quality is going down. Although it is still a very beloved [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4253.2s)]
*  institution in, in England. In Canada, there are waiting lines and a perfect system by any means, [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4258.48s)]
*  but don't, you know, don't hear, don't believe all the right wing stuff in Canada. Their health, [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4265.599999999999s)]
*  if you ask the people in Canada, do they like their healthcare system as opposed to America's [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4270.96s)]
*  that has come out much better. Yeah. Speaking on healthcare, [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4275.44s)]
*  Trump recently signed an executive order to lower drug prices. How do you feel about that? [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4278.639999999999s)]
*  You believe what you saw in the Bay bar. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4283.5199999999995s)]
*  There's no way you've been living in Vermont for 50 years. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4291.36s)]
*  What he did is say, we're going to give the drug companies a certain period of time to tell us how [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4296.96s)]
*  they're going to lower drug prices. And if they don't, we're going to do A, B and C. We're not [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4304.8s)]
*  quite sure what A, B and C will be, but the likelihood is that A, B and C will be thrown [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4308.24s)]
*  out in the courts because the president doesn't have a right to tell companies how to fix prices. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4313.599999999999s)]
*  Just coincidentally, Bobby Kennedy, the secretary of HHS was before the committee and I'm the ranking [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4321.2s)]
*  member of, and I asked Bobby and I said, look, the president talks about substantially lowering [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4327.28s)]
*  prescription drug prices. You do. We're going to introduce legislation that will do just that. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4333.52s)]
*  And when you work with me, he said they will. So to answer your question, the president talks a lot, [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4340.400000000001s)]
*  don't believe what he says. We're going to put them to the test. We are going to bring forth [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4344.96s)]
*  legislation that would make sure that Americans don't pay a price any higher than people around [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4349.68s)]
*  the rest of the world. We'll see if they come up. So isn't a better framing of that, not to be [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4354.64s)]
*  contentious here, but like, isn't a better framing of that? Hey, Trump is saying this thing we agree [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4358.0s)]
*  on. We agree with you and we're going to hold you to your word instead of you're a liar. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4362.08s)]
*  That's what I'm doing. Well, that's exactly right. Yeah. Like I think that's like, cause sometimes [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4366.64s)]
*  we get caught up in this partisan shit where it's like sometimes both sides agree and it'd be nice [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4372.88s)]
*  if we at least get drug prices lower. Trump's idea of substantially lowering prices is exactly [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4377.84s)]
*  right. It's exactly what I fought for for years. Okay. So if Trump is willing to work with us, [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4384.72s)]
*  we'll do it. Absolutely. I think he will probably not, but I may be surprised. And then if he doesn't, [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4390.24s)]
*  let's hold him to his word and let's make sure he puts a pressure on those same [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4395.76s)]
*  senators that he would have primaried. Exactly. This is what you were saying you want. You get [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4400.48s)]
*  your senators in line, right? Actually, I don't know if you're like infringing on the democratic [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4405.2s)]
*  process by saying to do that, but like it would be really great. Especially those of us who have [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4408.639999999999s)]
*  like older parents who are really relying on these drugs right now. Yes. But don't get me going on [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4412.8s)]
*  the drug industry. Well, I kind of want to get you going. We want you to get going on everything. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4417.84s)]
*  Well, I got to get going to the airport. They got a plane as a matter of fact, but [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4423.360000000001s)]
*  we'll fly you private. All right. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4426.16s)]
*  Look, you've got a pharmaceutical industry that makes a hundred billion dollars in profit last [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4433.84s)]
*  year. We had a guy before the committee, CEO of a major company makes 50 million bucks a year. They [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4439.12s)]
*  do stock buybacks. So, you know, it is a, meanwhile, the same medicine that you buy in this country, [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4445.84s)]
*  whether it's a Zempik or Wigovia, whatever it may be, it is in some cases five, eight times [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4454.4800000000005s)]
*  more expensive than it is in Canada and Europe. It's insane. It is insane. Of course it's insane. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4460.08s)]
*  And they do it because they can do it because we are the only guy, you know, why they do it. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4465.4400000000005s)]
*  All right. Question. You know how many paid lobbyists there are for the drug companies [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4469.280000000001s)]
*  in Washington? They say take a guess. 200, 500, 15,000. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4473.6s)]
*  1500. All right. So you got 535 members of Congress, 1500. He's a former leader of the [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4478.320000000001s)]
*  Democrats. So that's a lot of power. And then their campaign contributions. So up until Biden, [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4484.72s)]
*  and I work with Biden on this, we have never, what other countries do is they say, good, [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4491.200000000001s)]
*  you got a drug, that's great. Oh, let's negotiate the price you're going to charge us. Right? That's [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4495.84s)]
*  what they do. Every other country on earth. For us, you got a drug, you charge any price you want. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4500.4s)]
*  Doesn't matter. For the first time, what we did is now have a law that says we are going to [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4504.4s)]
*  negotiate, Medicare will negotiate drug prices. We start off with 10, it'll be expanding. Is it [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4511.36s)]
*  enough? No. Is it as thought? Yes, it is. Yeah. I just feel like there should be a certain point [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4516.4s)]
*  in time where patriotism kicks in. If you're an American fucking company, you're going to gouge [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4522.4s)]
*  your own citizens, but let the Canadians and the Europeans pay way less? I don't look at it [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4527.92s)]
*  like that. But I'll tell you where it becomes not funny is there are kids around the world who die [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4533.4400000000005s)]
*  from easily preventable diseases. And these drugs costs, once you do the research, which is expensive [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4540.56s)]
*  and the development, which is expensive, but once you have the product, it sometimes costs you a few [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4547.28s)]
*  cents to manufacture the drug. And there were children around the world who died in Africa, [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4551.6s)]
*  in Asia from preventable diseases because these drug companies are charging prices that those [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4557.36s)]
*  countries can't afford. And that is, so you talk about pain, then you talk about humanity, [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4562.48s)]
*  whether we let kids die for profit. It's excessive. I know you got to go real quick before you go, [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4567.28s)]
*  we hear the term lobbyists all the time. Yes. I don't think I know what that means. Does somebody [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4573.68s)]
*  meet you at a coffee shop? No. Not you obviously, but how does that, how does a lobbyist care? [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4579.92s)]
*  This is what it means. I represent, you know, Mr. X represents a large corporation. We'd love [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4585.52s)]
*  to sit down with you and your staff. We sat with the staff to talk about the problems that we have. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4594.4800000000005s)]
*  And these are our needs. And by the way, we've got a great, we, the company has great staff. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4599.360000000001s)]
*  We can write legislation, help you write because we know how busy you are. Oh, wow. And by the way, [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4604.8s)]
*  we'd love to do a fundraiser for you. So the combination of, and we have friends who come [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4610.0s)]
*  together and we have super backs. So it, and by the way, some of these guys will know members of [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4616.08s)]
*  the Senate and the House because they're formless. What do you think most senators when they retire [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4622.4s)]
*  do? Where do you think they go? Oh, wow. They sleep around watching, they see they work. So, [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4626.5599999999995s)]
*  hey Joe, how are you? How's the wife? Kids good or well? Listen, this is what we got. They know [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4631.04s)]
*  each other. So, and it's Republicans and Democrats. Check it out. I mean, for both literally [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4635.68s)]
*  leaders of the Republican and Democratic party, so it's money, it's connections, it's friendship, [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4641.04s)]
*  it's ability to write tough legislation. You think writing a tax bill is easy? It's not. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4648.96s)]
*  You need really sophisticated accounts. Line 48, section three, just inject this one sentence in [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4654.56s)]
*  there. They won't even see it. Please answer yes. Are you going to run for president? [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4662.48s)]
*  Please ask yes. I'm 83 years of age, so that is, I think I've run my last race. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4671.44s)]
*  Now does that mean, zero fair races, does that mean that this oligarchy tour is you passing [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4678.48s)]
*  the baton? Don't look at it like that. The oligarchy tour is, I think we're all looking [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4684.719999999999s)]
*  at it like that. No, it's not a passing the baton. I haven't, you know, I think Alexander is great, [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4690.56s)]
*  but it's not my job to determine who the new leaders are. You know, people have each of them, [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4696.8s)]
*  as I mentioned in the House, there are a lot of great people in the Senate, there's some good [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4702.88s)]
*  people, and there are people who are not in office right now. But the oligarchy tour was an effort [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4706.4800000000005s)]
*  to say to the country that there are people all over America who are going to stand up to this [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4716.799999999999s)]
*  oligarchy. They don't want a government of billionaires. They're going to stand up to [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4724.16s)]
*  authoritarianism. There are people, as I'm sure you're familiar with, a young woman from Turkey, [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4727.759999999999s)]
*  for God sakes, was in Massachusetts, went to Tufts University. You remember that? This woman [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4733.44s)]
*  walks down the street, some of these guys grab her with masks on, throw her into a van, take her to a [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4738.799999999999s)]
*  detention center. Why? Because she wrote an op-ed critical of the war in Gaza. Really? That's what [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4745.6s)]
*  goes on in America. And we're seeing that. So, you know, this was an opportunity for people, [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4752.320000000001s)]
*  by the zillion, we were shocked, to be honest with you, when I ran for president, [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4760.56s)]
*  we had very large turnouts. These are larger. I mean, in LA, we had 36,000 in Denver, we had 34, [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4764.72s)]
*  I mean, insane, insane turnouts. We went to Idaho, the most conservative state in the country, [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4770.8s)]
*  we had 12,000 people outside of Boise. So we wanted to give people the opportunity to stand up [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4778.88s)]
*  and say, no, we're not happy with the direction that Trump is taking this country. Wow. Sorry, [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4785.28s)]
*  I want to go ahead. I'm curious, like, I find you very brave and I find the work that you do. No, [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4790.4800000000005s)]
*  I am not brave. I find you brave personally. And because I recognize that what you're doing [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4795.2s)]
*  disrupts, or at least you are attempting to disrupt, many powerful people and their access to [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4800.96s)]
*  unthinkable amounts of wealth. So I'm curious, in your work and in your political career, [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4807.52s)]
*  have you ever felt that your personal safety was ever threatened? Well, I don't want to get into [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4811.360000000001s)]
*  that. But do we have security issues? Wow. Is that your question? Of course we do. And I'm not. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4817.2s)]
*  And the more power that you have, the higher the concern of that security? I don't want to get into [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4821.76s)]
*  it. But those are those are issues. That's why I find this one. I just want to let you know, [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4827.76s)]
*  Bernie, we're here to bang for you, bro. Yeah, we're here to bang for you. If you need anything, [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4832.16s)]
*  you let us know. Okay. You still got a lot of love in New York City. You're safe here, man. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4836.0s)]
*  I can't say anything for Idaho, but if you need anything in the five boroughs, we got you. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4840.400000000001s)]
*  Sorry, if I may follow up on one thing that you brought up earlier, [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4845.68s)]
*  revolutionizing education. How would you do that beyond paying teachers more? I just need to know. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4847.84s)]
*  Yeah. I think sitting kids at a desk for long hours is probably not the best way to [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4852.16s)]
*  create the kind of creativity that we want in kids. At the end of the day, if you are excited [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4863.5199999999995s)]
*  about learning, you're going to learn. And if I pound that excitement out of you that every child [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4869.68s)]
*  instinctively adds, and tell you to memorize, you know, what George Washington did, I'm going [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4875.2s)]
*  to make school a painful experience. So interesting, I use Finland as an example, [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4881.36s)]
*  because their kids, they usually do better. Their kids, they allow their kids to be kids [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4885.92s)]
*  to play a lot, to socialize a lot. But you got to keep the spark alive. And once that spark is [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4893.92s)]
*  alive, curiosity is alive, learning takes place, learning takes place, the rest takes place. So I [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4901.759999999999s)]
*  think you need a revolution in that sense of the word. And also, of course, the financial [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4906.48s)]
*  barrier should be eliminated. I don't care if you're low income, you want to become an engineer, [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4911.44s)]
*  you'd be able to do that. So those are some of the things. Before you leave, how can people who feel [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4916.32s)]
*  like your message has really resonated with them today help? Help you, help the cause? Yeah, look, [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4921.839999999999s)]
*  we are trying to build, to do something which is very, very difficult. And I think we're having [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4930.0s)]
*  some success, and we've had some success, is, you know, come to our social media, you know, [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4936.24s)]
*  we have a Senate page and we have a campaign page, more political. We are supporting and will be [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4943.04s)]
*  supporting more progressive candidates running for Congress, Senate, and so forth. And I will tell [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4950.16s)]
*  you, think outside of the box in your own lives. These are unprecedented times, and we've got to [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4961.12s)]
*  respond in an unprecedented way. And you think, and each, every one of us is different. You don't [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4968.0s)]
*  want to run for office, fine, what else can you be doing? Help people form a union? Become involved [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4973.04s)]
*  in education in a way you did not be involved before. You think it through. But we need more [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4979.44s)]
*  participation. We don't need what the system really, and this I've experienced, I've seen it [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4985.36s)]
*  a million times. What the oligarchs and the ruling class want you to believe is that you're powerless. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4991.12s)]
*  You have no power. And once you accept that, they win. They win. We have power. We're a lot more, [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=4998.48s)]
*  a lot more. The joy that I've had in my life is to be in every state in this country and talk to, [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=5006.08s)]
*  I've been in rallies where you see these wonderful people, often young people, [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=5012.56s)]
*  they're black and they're white and they're Latino and they're gay and they're straight and [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=5016.320000000001s)]
*  they're out there and they want a different America. And that's what inspires me. I've seen it with my [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=5020.8s)]
*  own eyes. They're out there. They don't believe in greed and they don't believe in, you know, [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=5025.120000000001s)]
*  so many of the things that we're seeing right now. Those people are going to stand up. You [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=5030.56s)]
*  got to come to the plate and we got to do what we can to transform the country. Time is late. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=5035.6s)]
*  We're dealing with authoritarianism. We're dealing with climate. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=5041.759999999999s)]
*  Let's get involved in ways that we've never been involved before. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWVbQQwWJo&t=5048.639999999999s)]
