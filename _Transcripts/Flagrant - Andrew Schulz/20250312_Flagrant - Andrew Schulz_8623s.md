**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [March 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M)
*  What's up, everybody? Welcome to Playground. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=0.0s)]
*  Listen, I just got to start off the show by saying [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=2.4s)]
*  I did not know that that was gonna happen last night at Raw. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4.8s)]
*  You know, Logan mentioned that, like, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7.34s)]
*  hey, I might, like, point at you or something like that. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8.74s)]
*  And then this fucking Judas runs up on me [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=10.74s)]
*  and tries to make me lie to everybody [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=13.42s)]
*  at Madison Square Garden. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=15.44s)]
*  If we were at, like, the Brooklyn Nets Arena, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  whatever the fuck that is called, okay, I'll lie all day. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=18.72s)]
*  I'll do whatever bullsh- you want for the wrestling, right? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=20.78s)]
*  Not in Madison Square Garden. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=23.06s)]
*  So I tell him the real, which I think you should do [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=25.36s)]
*  to someone who I thought was a friend, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=28.02s)]
*  the guy invited me to his fucking wedding last week. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=29.419999999999998s)]
*  So I have to tell him, like, listen, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=31.52s)]
*  nobody's fucking here to see you. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=32.86s)]
*  You're not even wrestling tonight. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=34.06s)]
*  His ego is so fragile, he grabs me, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=34.96s)]
*  he pulls me over that front of my wife. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=36.76s)]
*  Yeah. That's pretty emasculating. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=38.96s)]
*  It really is. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=40.4s)]
*  I just put out a special about how my balls don't work. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=41.4s)]
*  Yeah. And now I get bent over a railing [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=43.54s)]
*  in front of my wife. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=45.379999999999995s)]
*  And in front of the dog. Both of them. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=46.379999999999995s)]
*  Both of my wives. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=47.9s)]
*  Both of my wives clutching their pearls. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=49.379999999999995s)]
*  Just state a word, man. If it's on a cypher, Logan, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  I'm gonna be like, I'm gonna do it too. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=53.379999999999995s)]
*  I was shocked that you didn't pull up, bro. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=54.379999999999995s)]
*  No, he tried. I was a little too far back. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=56.019999999999996s)]
*  We ain't far back. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=58.98s)]
*  You were like second row or something like that. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=59.98s)]
*  I saw you. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=61.42s)]
*  I didn't do too much effort either. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=62.42s)]
*  Did that? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=63.42s)]
*  Honestly, I felt let down, bro. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=64.42s)]
*  I felt let down. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=66.26s)]
*  Because I had my boys right there. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=67.26s)]
*  I had my boys right there, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=68.8s)]
*  and I thought you were gonna jump in that rank. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=69.8s)]
*  Thank God for AJ Styles. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=71.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=72.74s)]
*  I mean, you're a diehard wrestler. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=74.84s)]
*  Thank God for that perfectly timed take, AJ Styles. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=75.84s)]
*  Well, when did you buy tickets for this? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=78.44s)]
*  Say again? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=79.68s)]
*  You bought tickets for this? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=80.68s)]
*  Yeah, I bought tickets for it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=81.68s)]
*  When? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=82.68s)]
*  I gotta check my calendar. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=83.68s)]
*  When did you buy it? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=84.68s)]
*  No, wait a minute. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=85.68s)]
*  We bought the tickets for it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=86.68s)]
*  It was months ago. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=88.0s)]
*  Yo, months ago. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=89.0s)]
*  Like the second it was announced, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=90.0s)]
*  I was like, oh shit, Raw is coming out. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=91.0s)]
*  I'm going to that shit. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=92.0s)]
*  Like when who was fighting? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=93.0s)]
*  When Seth Rollins and Seth Rollins were announced. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=94.0s)]
*  They were gonna be headlining a steel cage match. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=97.0s)]
*  Have you ever fucking seen a steel cage match? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=100.0s)]
*  Never. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=103.0s)]
*  I've actually never. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=104.0s)]
*  I've never seen a steel cage match. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=105.0s)]
*  Yeah, and it changed your goddamn life. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=106.0s)]
*  Yeah, I thought it was Sega's L, to be honest. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=107.0s)]
*  Yeah, so did all of us. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=108.0s)]
*  That's why 18,000 people were there. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=109.0s)]
*  Okay, to see that, not Logan Paul, you fucking jerk. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=110.0s)]
*  Okay, and you guys couldn't have my back. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=114.0s)]
*  You could have had your moment, okay? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=116.0s)]
*  He got brand new Air Force Ones. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=117.32s)]
*  He wasn't going to ruin them for that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=118.32s)]
*  Why don't you take off your shoes like that little Asian girl wrestler [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=121.32s)]
*  that came into the ring. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=124.32s)]
*  My sister's going got it! [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=125.32s)]
*  You know, it was the best moment ever. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=129.32s)]
*  Mark got his video. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=131.32s)]
*  That was cool. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=132.32s)]
*  That was... [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=133.32s)]
*  She was cutting her promo and she was just leaning into that accent. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=134.32s)]
*  She was going for it though. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=137.32s)]
*  And she slapped the shit out of those girls, man. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=138.32s)]
*  I like that kind of energy. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=141.32s)]
*  You saw the jewelry fly everywhere? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=142.32s)]

*  Yeah, that was fire. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=144.32s)]
*  Yeah, I like that kind of energy. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=145.32s)]
*  Son, you saw a dove reaching for it? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=146.64s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=149.64s)]
*  Gym. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=152.64s)]
*  He's like that thing from Fantastic Beasts. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=153.64s)]
*  Anyway, no, Logan needed to get his, bro. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=160.64s)]
*  I ain't going to lie. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=165.64s)]
*  I thought that was crazy. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=166.64s)]
*  Yeah, that was messed up. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=167.64s)]
*  So we'll see what happens. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=168.64s)]
*  He got to check in when he comes back to New York. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=169.64s)]
*  No, he got to check in. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=170.64s)]
*  Matter of fact, I might go to your wedding now. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=171.64s)]
*  I wasn't going to go. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=172.64s)]
*  But I might go to your wedding now. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=173.64s)]
*  I might hit you with a fucking suplex. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  I also just like to point out something for the historic record. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=177.95999999999998s)]
*  I think I'm the only person in wrestling history to be pulled over a railing, thrown down on [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  the floor like a rag doll, rolled into the ring, put in a suplex, not officially suplex, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  and still jumped on a top rope. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=194.95999999999998s)]
*  Nobody in the history of wrestling has done less to get on those top ropes. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=200.28s)]
*  So you look at it, and he was like, fucking I'm going to go. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=205.28s)]
*  I wasn't going to do it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=208.28s)]
*  Then AJ was like, yo, go do it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=210.28s)]
*  Go jump up there. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=211.28s)]
*  I was like, I ain't going to ever get this opportunity. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=212.28s)]
*  No, it worth it, though. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=215.28s)]
*  It was worth it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=216.28s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=217.28s)]
*  Me and Miles was like, oh, man, he's going to hurt himself jumping down. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=218.28s)]
*  I was like, he's going to pull something when he jumps down. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=221.28s)]
*  There's a moment where I thought I was going to catch my foot on the way up. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=224.28s)]
*  I didn't know if you'd jump on the top rope or the second rope. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=227.6s)]
*  I thought about the top rope, and I was like, ain't no way I can bounce on that motherfucker. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=232.6s)]
*  I actually kind of went like this. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=235.6s)]
*  And he went face forward off it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=238.6s)]
*  Scorpion. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=241.6s)]
*  They got to stretch him out. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=242.6s)]
*  He would have left looking like Rey Mysterio. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=245.6s)]
*  There was a match, I don't know if you all saw that, when Rey Mysterio, he did that, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=248.6s)]
*  jumped off the thing. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=254.6s)]
*  Isn't really him. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=255.6s)]
*  I think it's like Shamu. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=256.92s)]

*  That one exactly. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=575.8s)]
*  $5 a month. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=576.8s)]
*  Completely shameless promo. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=577.8s)]
*  It felt like me showing up at WWD Raw the week after my special came out. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=578.8s)]
*  That was real. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=581.8s)]
*  Even though I bought those tickets months, when did we buy those tickets, Dove? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=582.8s)]

*  2022. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=586.8s)]
*  You know what's funny about wrestling? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=587.8s)]
*  Wrestling fans are like, I actually really like this about wrestling. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=588.8s)]
*  So back in the day, there was this illusion that wrestling wasn't scripted and all these [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=591.7199999999999s)]
*  punches were landing, whatever. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=594.7199999999999s)]
*  Now, the base is so acutely aware that it's scripted, now you don't have the facade. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=595.7199999999999s)]
*  There's no lie that needs to be told. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=603.4399999999999s)]
*  Now you get to get them on story. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=606.64s)]
*  But they appreciate, they know all the terminology. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=608.76s)]
*  They know like baby face, they know heel, they know all that kind of stuff. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=611.3599999999999s)]
*  They know like when you get a move done on you, it's called a bump or whatever. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=614.92s)]
*  So, they're seeing this thing happening and they're reacting to the thing as if it was [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=618.76s)]
*  a script, which honestly really hurt me because I didn't realize that this whole fucking thing [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=626.12s)]
*  was going to happen in the first place. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=629.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=631.16s)]
*  But I felt, this is your close friend. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=632.16s)]
*  Yeah, this is my close friend whose wedding I was going to not go to already, but now [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=634.68s)]
*  I'm really not going to go. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=637.72s)]
*  But I did get an invite. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=639.68s)]
*  And it's on site for them. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=640.68s)]
*  It is on site. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=641.68s)]
*  Okay, but I do appreciate the wrestling fans as well, I'm trying to say. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=642.68s)]
*  I was surprised to see the amount of adults there. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=646.24s)]
*  I thought I was going to see way more kids. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=649.16s)]
*  It was like maybe 5% kids. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=651.36s)]
*  You realize Marc and I are the only people that have kids in all of New York City. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=653.1999999999999s)]
*  And there are two toddlers in New York City and Marc and I own them. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=656.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's maybe it. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=660.9599999999999s)]
*  But I was surprised. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=661.9599999999999s)]
*  The whole way Al kept on leaning over, he's like, yo, where are the kids, dude? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=662.9599999999999s)]

*  I was trying to keep him physical. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=668.9599999999999s)]
*  What were you guys' takes on it? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=670.9599999999999s)]
*  What did you guys think about the whole spectacle? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=673.48s)]
*  Oh, it's great. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=675.5600000000001s)]
*  It's nice because it's sports, but you're able to interact with the athletes in an honest way. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=676.5600000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=681.5600000000001s)]
*  If you go to an NBA game, you can't talk all the shit you want to talk. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=682.5600000000001s)]
*  Whereas with these guys, you can go crazy. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=685.5600000000001s)]

*  They're like emotional. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=749.96s)]
*  Or they just did a move on. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=750.96s)]
*  Someone did a move on them and they're like reeling, but they're committed to that shit. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=751.96s)]
*  Because there's a moment where I'm just sitting on the ropes. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=754.96s)]

*  Oh, no. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=878.08s)]

*  He's like, I want it, but can you mail it to me? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=889.08s)]
*  And the guy's like, no, I can't mail it to you. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=891.08s)]

*  He was mushing. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=904.08s)]

*  I mean, Steel Cage is crazy. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=916.84s)]
*  The ending with Roman Reigns. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=918.84s)]
*  Yeah, that was it. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=920.84s)]
*  That motherfucker, like, certain dudes are just, they are it. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=921.84s)]
*  He's like a superhero. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=926.84s)]
*  I didn't get it until I saw him in person. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=927.84s)]
*  Yeah, he has presence. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=929.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=930.84s)]
*  Seeing it live, there are people that can really command the energy and they milk the [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=931.84s)]
*  And also, there's a physicality to it. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=936.0s)]
*  He's a huge guy that's incredibly agile. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=939.0s)]
*  And when he did that spear or whatever the fuck it is, it was right in front of us. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=942.0s)]
*  It was unbelievable. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=946.0s)]
*  Also, to see him punk and Seth Rollins dudes, this is another thing I look at. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=947.0s)]
*  How much do you believe what's happening is really happening? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=952.0s)]
*  How much do you believe the pain that you're enduring is really there? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=956.0s)]
*  If you watch them, they believe it. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=959.0s)]
*  They are 100% in. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=962.0s)]
*  They're sweating, they're exhausted, and we can kind of become part of that reality [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=964.96s)]
*  if they actually commit. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=969.96s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=971.96s)]
*  I mean, seeing him punk sitting in the cage as people are leaving. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=972.96s)]
*  He was the last one to leave. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=975.96s)]
*  I think he was just sitting there the whole time, just milking it for the next 35 minutes. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=977.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's awesome. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=980.96s)]
*  No, it was, like, seeing those two guys, that was really elite. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=981.96s)]
*  Those guys probably doing it decades, but that was elite wrestling in terms of commitment [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=986.96s)]
*  to that match. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=993.9200000000001s)]
*  Oh, I mean, taking a suplex off the top of the cage. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=994.9200000000001s)]
*  Nah, crazy. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=997.9200000000001s)]

*  They make it look like padded for the people at home, but in reality, for those of us, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1021.88s)]
*  the professionals, the people, for those of us who are actually professional wrestlers [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1024.8799999999999s)]

*  Let's go! [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1054.8400000000001s)]
*  Like, you shook it like it made noise. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1058.8400000000001s)]
*  It dumped it. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1060.8400000000001s)]
*  It doesn't make a noise, but it felt like it was blowing something up there. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1061.8400000000001s)]
*  It got the fans into it, though. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1063.8400000000001s)]
*  It got us into it. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1064.8400000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1065.8400000000001s)]
*  Like, that! [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1066.8400000000001s)]
*  It got us into it. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1067.8400000000001s)]
*  Nah, nah, nah, nah. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1068.8400000000001s)]
*  Wait, he beat Alex up. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1069.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm like, damn, man. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1070.8400000000001s)]
*  It's like, I didn't know where to put my hands. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1071.8400000000001s)]
*  I think I almost grabbed his tuchus. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1073.8400000000001s)]
*  Oh, they threw you over here? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1078.8400000000001s)]
*  Now watch this. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1080.8400000000001s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1081.8400000000001s)]
*  There you go. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1082.8400000000001s)]
*  Ready? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1083.8400000000001s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1084.8400000000001s)]
*  Watch this now. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1085.8400000000001s)]
*  You was in it. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1089.8400000000001s)]
*  You was in it. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1090.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1091.8400000000001s)]
*  Now I don't know what to do. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1094.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm just chilling at a bar. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1096.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you're supposed to be hurt in the corner, man. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1098.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1101.8400000000001s)]
*  So... [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1102.8400000000001s)]
*  I mean, awesome. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1103.8400000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1104.8400000000001s)]
*  That stuff is great. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1105.8400000000001s)]
*  So here's this moment right here where we're like, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1107.8s)]
*  I want to Dap him, but I don't... [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1109.8s)]
*  Okay, so before that, I wanted to go Dap him, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1111.8s)]
*  but I didn't want to mess up his celebration [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1113.8s)]
*  and just be out there like this. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1115.8s)]
*  But he was great. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1119.8s)]
*  Shout out to you, dude. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1120.8s)]
*  Well, we missed out on John Cena, though. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1121.8s)]
*  I was trying to see Heel John Cena. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1123.8s)]
*  Yo, we got to see Heel. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1124.8s)]
*  You should have snuck in a leg drop or something. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1125.8s)]
*  Just something a bit surprising. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1127.8s)]
*  I mean, that would have been. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1130.8s)]
*  That would have been hot. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1132.8s)]
*  That would have been. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1133.8s)]
*  That's the other thing. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1135.76s)]
*  I wonder if I did some extra shit, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1136.76s)]
*  but it actually worked out. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1137.76s)]
*  I don't know if WWE would be that mad. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1139.76s)]
*  Why would they? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1141.76s)]
*  But if it doesn't work out... [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1142.76s)]
*  That's even better, though. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1144.76s)]
*  Then I'm never going to be WWE Champion. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1145.76s)]
*  And that's another thing that's probably really important. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1150.76s)]
*  But not working out would be way funnier. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1152.76s)]
*  You going up on the ropes and falling over Scorpion [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1154.76s)]
*  on the ground, through a table, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1156.76s)]
*  ruin Rey Mysterio's whole match. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1158.76s)]
*  But they'd be like, yeah, this is perfect. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1160.76s)]
*  This is actually way better [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1161.76s)]
*  than what we thought was going to happen. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1162.76s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1165.72s)]
*  You versus John Cena. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1166.72s)]
*  That's what I want to see. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1167.72s)]
*  Hell yeah, man. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1168.72s)]
*  I'm sitting home alone there. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1169.72s)]
*  He was hype. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1170.72s)]
*  He loves his wrestling shit. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1171.72s)]
*  Yeah, he really loves wrestling. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1172.72s)]
*  He really loves... [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1174.72s)]
*  McCauley Culkin. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1175.72s)]
*  McCauley Culkin. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1176.72s)]
*  He was there? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1177.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1178.72s)]
*  You didn't see McCauley Culkin? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1179.72s)]
*  No. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1180.72s)]
*  He was there all the way. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1181.72s)]
*  He was hype. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1182.72s)]
*  No way. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1183.72s)]
*  I asked him about the MJ shit. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1184.72s)]
*  On the way out. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1185.72s)]
*  On the way out. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1186.72s)]
*  I'm the one who asks crazy questions. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1187.72s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1190.72s)]
*  You can't act about that shit. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1191.72s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1192.72s)]
*  Didn't they sleep together or some shit like that? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1194.68s)]
*  What? [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1197.68s)]
*  Didn't he do sleepovers at his crib? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1198.68s)]
*  It was physical. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1199.68s)]
*  He got a physical. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1200.68s)]
*  It's not anything weird, bro. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1201.68s)]
*  How do you ask that? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1202.68s)]
*  I just went up to him. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1203.68s)]
*  He always pleasured me to. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1204.68s)]
*  The MJ, fuck your butt when you were a kid. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1205.68s)]
*  How'd you ask that? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1206.68s)]
*  Like that. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1207.68s)]
*  Like that. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1208.68s)]
*  How'd you ask him for it? [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1209.68s)]
*  I asked him. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1210.68s)]
*  I was like, yo, did MJ fuck your butt? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1211.68s)]
*  Did he jerk you and other kids off? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1212.68s)]
*  And he was like, yeah, that happened. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1213.68s)]
*  I was like, how'd you know that? [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1214.68s)]
*  I was like, yeah, I'm a kid. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1215.68s)]
*  I'm a kid. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1216.68s)]
*  I'm a kid. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1217.68s)]
*  I'm a kid. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1218.68s)]
*  I'm a kid. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1219.68s)]

*  I was like, how'd he do it? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1224.64s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1229.64s)]
*  I was pussy. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1230.64s)]
*  I just said, hey, pleasure to meet you. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1231.64s)]
*  What's up, man? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1233.68s)]
*  Damn. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1234.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1235.68s)]
*  What would you have said? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1236.68s)]
*  Now you're about to tell me the truth. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1237.68s)]
*  You suck, bro. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1238.68s)]
*  He's like, yo, MJ's a legend, right? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1239.68s)]
*  Two episodes. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1242.68s)]
*  What do you say to Macaulay Culkin? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1243.68s)]
*  Son, Michael Jordan Jackson was a legend. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1245.68s)]
*  I'm involved with a legend. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1248.68s)]
*  I'm involved with a legend, though. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1249.68s)]
*  What's that? [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1250.68s)]
*  I'm involved with a legend. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1251.68s)]
*  That's fucking- [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1252.68s)]
*  You wouldn't say that. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1253.68s)]
*  You wouldn't go, yo, Michael Jordan. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1254.68s)]
*  Right? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1257.68s)]
*  Michael Jordan did what to you? [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1258.68s)]
*  He'd be like nothing. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1259.68s)]
*  He'd be like, see, he proved it. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1260.68s)]
*  See? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1261.68s)]
*  He's innocent. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1262.68s)]
*  I'll be honest. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1263.68s)]
*  The only thing that I don't like about WWE is the fact that we can't bet on it. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1264.68s)]
*  Okay? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1268.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1269.68s)]
*  That's kind of bullshit. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1270.68s)]
*  I thought it was Logan Paul. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1271.68s)]
*  Also, there's two things I don't like about WWE. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1272.68s)]
*  It's Logan Paul. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1274.68s)]
*  Okay? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1275.68s)]
*  This part-timer. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1276.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1277.68s)]
*  And, of course, the fact that we cannot bet on it. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1278.68s)]
*  But, luckily for us, there are plenty of sports that we can't bet on. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1281.68s)]
*  Obviously, great UFC card. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1284.68s)]
*  I mean, Justin Gaethje is back in the fucking win column. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1286.68s)]
*  Amazing fight against Fizziev, however he pronounced his last name. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1289.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1293.68s)]
*  Perdida versus Ankolyev. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1294.68s)]
*  That was wild. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1295.68s)]
*  I did not see that coming at all. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1296.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1298.68s)]
*  I'm like, I need to have a talk with Izzy about that. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1299.68s)]
*  That was crazy. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1301.68s)]
*  Anyway, plenty more UFC. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1302.68s)]
*  We got VULK fighting in UFC Miami. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1304.68s)]
*  I think that's 314. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1306.68s)]
*  I think that's April coming up. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1307.68s)]
*  That's going to be wild. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1308.68s)]
*  That's a great card, too. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1309.68s)]
*  Plenty of ways where you can put some money down. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1311.68s)]
*  Steak, by the way, is where you're going to do it. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1313.68s)]
*  It's the leader in global betting in US social casinos. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1315.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1317.68s)]
*  Bet on top sports and political events. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1318.68s)]

*  Now, let's get back to the show. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1322.68s)]
*  Yo, take this bird off. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1323.68s)]
*  The Sand Hill Cranes. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1325.68s)]
*  It's brothers eating majestic birds. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1326.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1329.68s)]
*  What is it? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1330.68s)]
*  The situation? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1331.68s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1332.68s)]
*  Mark's plugging his fucking tie. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1333.68s)]
*  I'm trying to get my views up. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1335.68s)]
*  My bad, my bad. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1336.68s)]
*  Shut out of camp. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1337.68s)]
*  Shut out of camp. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1338.68s)]
*  Now, my brother called me and I was like, what are you doing? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1339.68s)]
*  He's like, oh, I'm cooking up some Sand Hill Crane. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1342.68s)]
*  And I was like, what does he mean? [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1344.68s)]
*  He's like, yeah, it's the ribeye of the sky. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1346.68s)]
*  It's like one of the nicest cuts of meat that you can buy this side of Mississippi. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1348.68s)]
*  So now he's gotten into exotic meats and apparently you can buy it online. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1352.68s)]
*  It's super, super rare, very expensive. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1355.68s)]
*  It's delicious. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1357.68s)]
*  Is it legal? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1358.68s)]
*  I think it's legal. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1359.68s)]
*  OK. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1360.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1361.68s)]
*  I killed one of those ones. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1362.68s)]
*  Really? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1363.68s)]
*  On a golf course. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1364.68s)]
*  Did not mean to. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1365.68s)]
*  I was like, there's no way I'll hit that one bird square in the fucking head. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1366.68s)]
*  But your friend said, yo, I'll kiss you on the mouth. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1369.68s)]
*  And I fucking smoked it. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1371.68s)]
*  Motherfucker turned into tiger. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1373.68s)]
*  Hold on, we got to get David in here. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1375.68s)]
*  So I don't know if any of you guys have listened to the Patreon. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1378.68s)]
*  Did we say exactly what happened? [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1382.68s)]
*  Not exactly. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1383.68s)]
*  All right. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1384.68s)]
*  So on New Year's Eve, this is a very quick version of it. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1385.68s)]
*  You can hear the full story in detail on Patreon. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1387.68s)]
*  But basically, in New Year's Eve, David allegedly says, yo, I want to come kiss you, whatever, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1390.68s)]
*  on when the ball drops. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1395.68s)]
*  And then Miles is like, bet. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1397.68s)]
*  And then Miles hits David up later because David hasn't followed up at all. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1399.68s)]
*  And he goes, yo, by the way, you made a great decision to stay in. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1404.68s)]
*  Like, it's rainy outside. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1407.68s)]
*  Which to me, in retrospect, is like, you fell rejected. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1408.68s)]
*  And you were like, I just want to make sure that you're not out. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1412.68s)]
*  And then David's like, all right, bet. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1415.68s)]
*  I'll come kiss you, whatever, if you want that. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1416.68s)]
*  And then so he comes to meet you. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1418.68s)]
*  And you're already there with two other gay guys. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1421.68s)]
*  You're hanging out with a bunch of gay guys. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1423.68s)]
*  That's very true. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1425.68s)]
*  And then 20 minutes after the New Year, so nothing to do with the ball dropping or anything, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1426.68s)]
*  you guys share a kiss with your lips, one lip on top like that. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1432.68s)]
*  Also his birthday. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1437.68s)]
*  No, no, 20 minutes after my birthday. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1438.68s)]
*  OK, OK. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1441.68s)]
*  So that is OK. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1442.68s)]
*  I forgot that part. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1444.68s)]
*  OK, so David, I don't know how much you heard of how I just broke that story down. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1446.68s)]
*  But is this more or less true? [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1452.68s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1454.68s)]
*  100%. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1455.68s)]
*  So again, did you feel a little bit sad for him? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1456.68s)]
*  Like, you would flippantly said, yo, we're going to totally make out on your birthday [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1459.68s)]
*  or whatever, like make out on New Year's, joking around. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1463.68s)]
*  You don't follow up because obviously you're not going to kiss Miles, right? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1466.68s)]
*  You guys work together. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1469.68s)]
*  You're also both women. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1470.68s)]
*  And then he hits you up later in the night. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1472.68s)]
*  He does hit me up. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1475.68s)]
*  Yeah, he goes, oh God. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1476.68s)]
*  What do you do? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1478.68s)]
*  Can I ask Miles two questions? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1479.68s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1481.68s)]
*  Your memory is bad. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1482.68s)]
*  I'm like a lawyer. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1483.68s)]
*  That's not really a question. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1484.68s)]
*  Would you agree that your memory is bad? [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1485.68s)]
*  He's leading the witness. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1487.68s)]
*  Look at him dominating you, son. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1488.68s)]
*  I don't understand why he likes him. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1490.68s)]
*  He didn't even ask a question. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1493.68s)]
*  He said, Miles, your memory is bad. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1495.68s)]
*  Miles goes, what? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1497.68s)]
*  I would say at times it can be. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1499.68s)]
*  Your memory is bad. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1502.68s)]
*  Your memory is bad, OK. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1503.68s)]
*  And you would say my memory is phenomenal. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1504.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1506.68s)]
*  OK. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1507.68s)]
*  I wanted to clarify that. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1508.68s)]
*  It's easier to remember when you're hitting in front of a bad guy. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1509.68s)]
*  I tried to black it out. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1511.68s)]
*  I tried not to. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1515.68s)]
*  OK, so your memory is bad. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1517.68s)]
*  Your memory is phenomenal. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1520.68s)]
*  OK, so what do you think exactly is going down? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1522.68s)]
*  So what happened was we were at dinner for Miles' birthday with Shifty. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1524.68s)]
*  It was me, Shifty, and Miles. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1528.68s)]
*  I was saying, oh, shit, I've had a phenomenal streak of having a New Year's kiss for the last seven years. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1530.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1535.68s)]
*  Can I ask one question? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1536.68s)]
*  Yeah, what's up? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1537.68s)]
*  David, on New Year's Eve, I don't have a great memory, so maybe you can remember this really well. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1538.68s)]
*  On New Year's Eve, have you ever kissed a guy besides me? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1544.68s)]
*  No. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1548.68s)]
*  He's lying. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1550.68s)]
*  He's lying. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1552.68s)]
*  Miles. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1554.68s)]
*  Miles. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1556.68s)]
*  Miles. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1558.68s)]
*  The worst fucking lawyer in history. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1560.68s)]
*  He's lying on the stand. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1562.68s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to jail. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1564.68s)]
*  Miles, you are the worst. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1566.68s)]
*  Miles, this is my time to talk. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1568.68s)]
*  I'm trying to be on the talk. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1570.68s)]
*  This is my time to talk. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1572.68s)]
*  But you're lying on the stand. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1573.68s)]
*  How can you prove that I'm lying? [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1574.68s)]
*  You've told me before that you just said that so you wouldn't fucking stand there. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1576.68s)]
*  You're lying. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1579.68s)]
*  I mean, he's lying. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1580.68s)]
*  Continue. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1582.68s)]
*  You said what you wanted to hear. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1583.68s)]
*  You guys are both talking about your fucking... [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1585.68s)]
*  He's lying. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1587.68s)]
*  Wow. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1588.68s)]
*  Got him. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1589.68s)]
*  God damn. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1590.68s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1591.68s)]
*  You ain't doing that to Logan, though. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1592.68s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1593.68s)]
*  All right, go, go, go. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1594.68s)]
*  So I'm like, all right, my streak's at risk because the woman I was speaking to at the [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1597.68s)]
*  time was out of town, so I'm like, Miles, if I see you around New Year's, I'm going to [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1602.68s)]
*  go after it. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1605.68s)]
*  As a joke or serious? [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1606.68s)]
*  It was kind of as a joke. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1608.68s)]
*  Yo. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1610.68s)]
*  The fuck is God? [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1611.68s)]
*  Wait, what do you mean by that? [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1613.68s)]
*  Hold on, Miles, you might be back. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1616.68s)]
*  Miles, you might be back. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1619.68s)]
*  Look at Brandon's face up there. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1621.68s)]
*  Brandon is one of our guys. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1623.68s)]
*  That's disgusting. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1625.68s)]
*  I don't get you. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1627.68s)]
*  What the fuck is God? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1629.68s)]
*  He's a guy named Brandon. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1631.68s)]
*  He's a guy named Brandon. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1634.68s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1636.68s)]
*  All right, all right. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1638.68s)]
*  He's like, go on. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1640.68s)]
*  So I'm out in East Village and I'm texting Miles like, hey, I'm at this party. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1641.68s)]
*  It's kind of after the ball drops, so I'm going to come to you, share your location. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1644.68s)]
*  I go to the bar. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1647.68s)]
*  Miles is at the back table with him, his girl, and then a gay couple. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1649.68s)]
*  I walk in and Miles gets up and meets me halfway. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1654.68s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1658.68s)]
*  So he initiated this pack. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1659.68s)]
*  I initiated it by going five blocks out of my way and meeting me at the bar. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1662.68s)]
*  I know. I was going there to say hi to you for New Year's. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1665.68s)]
*  Oh, shut up. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1667.68s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1672.68s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1676.68s)]
*  I didn't Uber to you. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1680.68s)]
*  I was at Studio 151 on 10th and C. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1681.68s)]
*  It's crazy. He Ubered to me and I stood up and he's like, you fucking. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1684.68s)]
*  Now, some might say that you put more of a commitment into it, but you could also say that your excitement made you leave your table and go. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1689.68s)]
*  I'd never left my table and walked five steps to go meet a friend to come back, sit down. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1697.68s)]
*  Like, that's a weird thing. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1702.68s)]
*  It was on the way to the L, so I'm like, I'll stop by. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1703.68s)]
*  Yeah, you're on the way. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1705.68s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1706.68s)]
*  Miles went out of his way and met me in the middle of the bar. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1707.68s)]
*  You went two blocks. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1711.68s)]
*  That's some dirty dancing shit right there, bro. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1713.68s)]
*  Hold on. So, OK, so he walks up, he grabs you by the waist. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1715.68s)]
*  And then we packed. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1720.68s)]
*  Miles leaned in. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1722.68s)]
*  OK, yeah, yeah. So, Miles did turn his head a little bit. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1724.68s)]
*  I was like this. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1727.68s)]
*  You went straight. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1728.68s)]
*  No, but not even straight. I kind of like tucked my chin in. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1729.68s)]
*  And then Miles went. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1732.68s)]
*  Oh, that's not true. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1734.68s)]
*  Oh, no, Brandon, what are you thinking, bro? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1736.68s)]
*  This is un. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1741.68s)]
*  I thought you all were bullshit. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1742.68s)]
*  It kills me. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1744.68s)]
*  It's just like, who else have you kissed besides me? [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1746.68s)]
*  Yeah, that does seem jealous right there. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1751.68s)]
*  He's lying on the stand. It's untrue. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1753.68s)]
*  I'm being slandered right now. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1755.68s)]
*  OK, so hold on. So, so you obviously are approaching David, right? [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1757.68s)]
*  Like, so David has to slow him up. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1761.68s)]
*  I got to dab him up. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1763.68s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1764.68s)]
*  That's not already. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1765.68s)]
*  And I was like, God damn, bro. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1766.68s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1769.68s)]
*  I was saying, God damn, bro, get away from me. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1770.68s)]
*  And then what did you do? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1772.68s)]
*  Then he grabs my face. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1774.68s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1776.68s)]
*  You grabbed his head? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1777.68s)]
*  No, I couldn't get away. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1779.68s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1780.68s)]
*  He met me at the bar. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1781.68s)]
*  Why would I initiate it if he's already walking towards me? [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1782.68s)]
*  You came to my bar. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1784.68s)]
*  You gave a bouncer your ID. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1785.68s)]
*  Are you old enough to get in here? [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1787.68s)]
*  And you're like, yeah, I am. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1789.68s)]
*  And also I'm on a mission. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1790.68s)]
*  You did a lot of steps to come see me. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1791.68s)]
*  I'd been at that bar for hours. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1793.68s)]
*  You were on the way to the L. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1794.68s)]
*  Like it was convenient for me. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1796.68s)]
*  Convenient? That's crazy. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1798.68s)]
*  You get a smooch. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1800.68s)]
*  OK, who pulled away first from the kiss? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1802.68s)]
*  Me. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1806.68s)]
*  I screamed out loud. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1807.68s)]
*  No, I screamed out loud. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1808.68s)]
*  I said, get away from me. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1809.68s)]
*  How did both downplay each other? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1811.68s)]
*  They both blew off his lips. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1814.68s)]
*  He's like, I'm like, kiss you. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1816.68s)]
*  Beth, come to my lips. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1818.68s)]
*  That's what we're both mad about. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1821.68s)]
*  That's what we're both angry about. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1823.68s)]
*  What went wrong, man? [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1825.68s)]
*  What happened afterwards? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1826.68s)]
*  Yeah, this feels like something personal. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1827.68s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like there's something else going on here. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1829.68s)]
*  What happened to you the rest of the night? [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1831.68s)]
*  I went back with a girl to her apartment. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1833.68s)]
*  And? [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1836.68s)]
*  Because she was so horny. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1837.68s)]
*  I'm all horny up. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1838.68s)]
*  Did you guys end up hooking up at the apartment, you and the girl? [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1840.68s)]
*  And did you guys have sex? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1843.68s)]
*  And did you think about David's face at all during it? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1845.68s)]
*  No. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1848.68s)]
*  No. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1849.68s)]
*  No images of it popped in, no thoughts of the kiss at all during the entire sexual encounter. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1850.68s)]
*  There's no point where, oh, that was funny when we kissed or whatever. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1854.68s)]
*  No. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1857.68s)]
*  That was almost like a threesome because she had both of us alive. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1858.68s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1861.68s)]
*  That was close to it. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1863.68s)]
*  Devil's triangle there. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1865.68s)]
*  What did the gay couple say about the kiss? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1866.68s)]
*  Did they rate it? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1868.68s)]
*  No. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1869.68s)]
*  They're not. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=1870.68s)]

*  Just saying how they also watch it. I was really cool and hopefully de-stigmatizing it a little bit because I know it can be a [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=2505.1s)]
*  That shit can be like lonely and isolating. Yeah [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=2511.86s)]

*  Thank you, bro. I hadn't heard anything take from somebody who remained nameless, but um [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=2657.0s)]
*  that someone was saying that the [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=2661.4s)]
*  even hate saying the word woke but like the the wokeness of Hollywood was a [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=2664.28s)]
*  reaction like an overcorrection to [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=2670.6s)]
*  What happened with Weinstein so [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=2674.76s)]
*  Everybody felt not everybody but I guess a lot of people there felt as if [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=2677.36s)]
*  Weinstein was an example of don't even go anywhere [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=2681.6400000000003s)]
*  Was Weinstein was an example of of what all of Hollywood was right? [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=2685.76s)]
*  So they're like the world thinks that we are all these horrible piss just bring girls up to hotel rooms, etc [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=2689.92s)]
*  So what we have to do is prove that we are not that and then they overcorrect in the other direction [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=2695.8s)]
*  That's a good take. Yeah, I thought it was interesting [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=2700.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, but uh, but I do see that like [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=2702.52s)]
*  Because that is kind of the stain that Hollywood had and maybe even still has for a while, right? [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=2706.68s)]
*  Like you know Hollywood's just a bunch of pedophiles. They're just saying that about everybody in Hollywood [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=2710.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so they're reacting to like online chatter, right? And they're like, oh my god [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=2714.12s)]
*  They think all of us producers were all just a bunch of these [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=2718.28s)]
*  And we fuck with kids and we just don't care about people [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=2721.8s)]

*  You should definitely do that when he's like a little bit older where they recognize shit because they're still at the age where they [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3141.0s)]
*  Don't know what's fake and real so like every doll that my daughter has or every like, uh, she like loves animals [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3146.12s)]
*  So every like fake stuffed animal she believes is a real animal [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3152.36s)]
*  And then she sees my dog and she also believes it's a real animal because it is [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3155.56s)]
*  but [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3159.72s)]
*  She cannot discern between the two so when we're at the natural history museum and you see these like [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3160.68s)]
*  Beautiful recreations of like what a wooly mammoth was she's like that's an alive animal. Oh, that's awesome [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3164.7599999999998s)]

*  It's made for your kid to look at it and go crazy and you just sit there smiling for hours. Yeah [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3178.8399999999997s)]

*  No, i'm not gonna lie. I bet but yeah, I think that they're real. I think they were birds [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3196.92s)]
*  Yeah, they have feathers and shit. That's something I learned like, uh, they got some good little information at some of these booths [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3200.84s)]
*  So on islands right that are remote [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3208.6800000000003s)]
*  So remote islands and the information informs like the the world that we live in right so on these remote islands the the small animals [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3217.0800000000004s)]
*  Tend to be much bigger because there's not as much natural predators there, right? [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3224.6000000000004s)]
*  So there's more of an abundance of food [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3229.2400000000002s)]
*  The big animals tend to be smaller, right? [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3230.84s)]
*  Like they have these like tiny miniature elephants that exist in some parts of the world and they're like the size of a dog [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3233.0800000000004s)]
*  And they get smaller because there's just not enough food for them to eat in this tiny little island just walking around all day [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3238.28s)]
*  Um [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3243.7999999999997s)]
*  Insular dwarfism. Yeah, is that what it's called? Yeah, okay [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3244.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3247.72s)]
*  And then what do they call the gigantism is is what happens to the small animals and then that's why like you'll see like [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3248.12s)]
*  Samoan women are so big and it's just because that's not that's not what I mean [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3254.3599999999997s)]
*  No, I think because there wasn't enough natural predators so they could just eat all the taro [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3259.4799999999996s)]
*  I I did a little bit [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3264.3599999999997s)]
*  I think there was like a there was like a line of thinking and then I took it there and I was like [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3265.56s)]
*  Gigantic simon women there was nothing to eat them. So they ate everything we need to bring roman [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3269.32s)]
*  Asians are small generally you go to asia. They're little they're itty bitty and then on this little island [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3277.56s)]

*  I'll fish them out of the garbage when you really gave up sugar for land for land [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3376.52s)]
*  Come on, dude, and you only have to give up one thing [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3379.64s)]
*  Give up multiple you give him multiple things. Well, I knew a guy that used to inflict pain [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3381.64s)]
*  He said I have nothing to give up. So I put like a little like bead in my shoe [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3385.48s)]
*  So I feel pain throughout the day [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3388.6s)]
*  Sorry guys, what did you give up? [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3391.56s)]
*  You're catholic you're a good catholic you gave up something absolutely. No, did you even do ash wednesday? No [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3394.7599999999998s)]

*  I just did put lotion on my forehead [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3404.7599999999998s)]
*  Ash Monday through Sunday [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3407.7200000000003s)]
*  Is your forehead too big? [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3410.28s)]
*  Um, but yeah, I uh didn't get to do ash wednesday. I missed out on it. We're in austin [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3412.36s)]
*  I would have gone. Yeah, I saw one dude turn this church is everywhere. You could have did it if you really wanted to do it [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3416.5200000000004s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing. You can make the sacrifice that we're doing take some dirt off the ground [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3421.0s)]
*  But the shit and walk around like an idiot bigger than that. I just prayed i've been praying because I just prayed to god [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3425.4s)]
*  I asked what I should give up. He said sugar and he said it's his will for me to get shredders for the summer [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3430.5200000000004s)]
*  Is what god wants from me, okay [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3435.4s)]
*  So i'm just i'm just following the lord. Shout out the lord bro. Lord always looks out. Did you do palm sunday? [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3437.56s)]
*  I used to like that day because yeah, you could turn it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that was fun. Yeah, that was cool [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3442.28s)]
*  Are you giving up anything for lent? No, come on, but I did see an interesting conversation. There's this guy that was uh, [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3447.08s)]
*  There's this show online [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3453.08s)]
*  where um [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3455.72s)]
*  Somebody goes and they sit in like a room full of uh people right and you sit in the middle and then other people can come [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3457.96s)]
*  Sit across from you and then you guys debate for like three minutes 20 v 1 20 v 1. Yes. It's like the balloon popping for [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3464.52s)]
*  white nerds [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3471.32s)]
*  And then um [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3475.64s)]
*  So there's this guy like sam cedar sitting down and then there was this [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3477.0s)]
*  Uh, just like latino kid who sits like across from him and he's having this [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3480.92s)]
*  Argument about like the importance I guess of morality and I think sam [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3485.48s)]
*  He was like asking where his morality comes from. I mean we can probably bring up a clip or it doesn't matter but um [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3489.32s)]
*  But it was interesting this take that he had like that [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3494.52s)]
*  You need a religious foundation for your morality. Otherwise you end up just justifying whatever makes you feel good [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3497.32s)]
*  And you can't just keep doing whatever makes you feel good because you won't have good societal outcomes from that [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3503.88s)]
*  And he was taking it to the extreme of [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3508.7599999999998s)]
*  You won't even have procreation [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3511.72s)]
*  Like if you take it to its furthest logical conclusion just doing whatever makes you feel good in the moment will lead to a population collapse [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3514.36s)]
*  how [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3522.2s)]
*  Because if you fucking that makes you feel good and a couple gonna get past the goalie [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3523.32s)]
*  Yeah, but maybe you fuck with uh a rubber because having a kid might not make you feel good make you feel good [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3526.92s)]
*  I mean [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3533.1600000000003s)]
*  It's monday night wrong every day watch this uh, watch this [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3535.2400000000002s)]
*  Are you an atheist? I'm a reformed jew. I should say that the way that these shows are set up [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3538.6000000000004s)]
*  I don't think he knows what everybody else's arguments are going to be used against him [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3543.48s)]
*  But it seems like everybody else there knows what that person in the middle thinks and they're there essentially to [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3547.4s)]
*  Refute whatever their beliefs are. Yeah, and usually they'll bring up a topic and then whoever wants to go [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3553.7200000000003s)]
*  Can they run it can pop it? Yeah, got it [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3558.84s)]
*  But but everybody comes there with ammunition and that person in the beginning is not I mean you should be prepared to defend your beliefs [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3560.52s)]
*  But you're going up against somebody who's already thought about every argument against you [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3566.6800000000003s)]
*  So like one person is prepared the other person is not but continue and so we have a civil society [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3570.52s)]
*  We have laws that is an interesting [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3575.0s)]
*  point that he was making right there, which is like [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3578.28s)]
*  If laws are based on like societal cohesion, but not some like moral framework, right? [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3581.32s)]
*  and society chooses to do something that we might [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3588.2000000000003s)]
*  morally object to [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3592.36s)]
*  If you go along with the societal decision, you could get some shitty outcomes [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3594.92s)]
*  So the idea of having this like moral framework [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3599.1600000000003s)]
*  That informs the societal decisions much to their chagrin at times [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3602.28s)]
*  Can sometimes protect the human experience [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3607.48s)]
*  You know, so if society all goes hey, we should have slavery and then the moral [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3610.76s)]
*  Opinion is no that's wrong to subject people to that sort of behavior. You can thwart what society [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3615.8s)]
*  Wants, I mean this would be the argument like why you want something out of simply what makes people feel good [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3622.28s)]
*  To be what drives your like moral compass, but couldn't you say the same the other way around? [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3628.1200000000003s)]
*  Because it's like if you have the moral framework of religion then we'll never have like gay [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3632.84s)]
*  100 that's why this is like a [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3639.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm not trying to say one is right or wrong. I'm just saying it's kind of exposing the limiting factors of both [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3642.0400000000004s)]
*  It's like we want [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3647.0800000000004s)]
*  The the moral framework of religiosity when it comes to like how we treat one another but then there are certain hang-ups with that [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3648.76s)]
*  Religiosity and then we go actually we don't want [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3655.2200000000003s)]
*  The religiosity so it's kind of like we're picking and choosing what we feel like is right [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3658.28s)]
*  I think he's using the term what civil society is but like civil society throughout history [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3663.1600000000003s)]
*  Has believed in some pretty nefarious shit. So [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3668.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's an interesting I think it's like I think just keep on going [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3672.36s)]
*  I don't want to interrupt at all [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3675.48s)]
*  But I think it's like a really interesting discussion like how do you figure out what is the best version of society for the most people? [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3676.28s)]
*  And the reality is you kind of need to pick and choose for both [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3683.6400000000003s)]
*  You know, you need a moral framework that you might object to that's brought to you by god or some higher power or something else [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3687.1600000000003s)]
*  But you also need to break that framework so that certain people can have the rights that they deserve as part of this idea of a civil society [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3692.52s)]
*  I don't know if you get there without both [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3701.08s)]
*  You can't just rely on people to make the right decision [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3703.08s)]
*  I think is what i'm trying to say well, I guess if you are an atheist or a secular person you could argue that [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3705.56s)]
*  Oh all of these religious dogmas just come out of basically the same exact thing [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3710.04s)]
*  So you're saying that the morality is internal before religion if god doesn't exist, which I think would be his argument that there is no god [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3714.2799999999997s)]
*  So therefore the rules that are laid out within Judaism Islam christianity are just human beings creating what they think the social structure should be [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3721.16s)]
*  And then the pushback someone might give is like, you know, we've created some fucked up rules that like really hurt a lot of people [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3727.64s)]
*  And so that's so over time [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3732.7599999999998s)]
*  We've gotten better like and this is the best time to live ever in the history 100 percent [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3735.08s)]
*  I guess my question is I don't have the answer. My question is like what is the impetus for that? [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3740.04s)]
*  like what made us realize was it this internal morality that we have like [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3743.96s)]
*  Um [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3749.0s)]
*  was it kind of like [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3750.2000000000003s)]
*  Erupting and we realized hey, this is actually wrong [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3751.94s)]
*  This goes against what we want internally and we like turn a blind eye to it [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3754.04s)]
*  Like what well secular people might lean on like natural law and say like there are certain things that violate what it means to be [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3758.44s)]
*  Like a fruitful human so like infringing on someone else's life or like sexual violence stuff like that [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3764.04s)]
*  So like we know that internally as a species that that is not good [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3769.4s)]
*  So you could come to that conclusion outside of the d.a. But why the fuck have we done it throughout the majority of history? [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3772.52s)]
*  If we know that it's so wrong, why have we done it continually like murder and things like that murder? [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3777.24s)]
*  You know [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3783.3199999999997s)]
*  assault women all these things [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3784.2799999999997s)]
*  But keep going keep going or like uh, alex and connor, yes [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3796.2s)]
*  Yeah, he'd be a good person to right. He's great. But uh, he popularized this idea [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3799.56s)]
*  I forgot what philosopher came up with it, but it's uh, I think it's ethical emotivism [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3803.56s)]
*  so basically it's this idea that you can basically just say like [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3807.56s)]
*  Something that happens you could say oh boo that thing so like murder [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3810.84s)]
*  You're not saying like murder is right or wrong. You're not putting like a truth value on it [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3814.68s)]
*  You're just saying boo murder. So like your emotional [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3817.56s)]
*  Reaction to murder to something is what justifies your moral compass and then ideally whatever the majority feels about a specific thing [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3820.36s)]
*  Then creates the social fabric for how that's enlisted into law [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3827.8s)]
*  So then how have we been so comfortable with murder throughout history? [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3830.84s)]
*  Well within our own civil society, we're not but then when it comes to like war that's not murder [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3835.2400000000002s)]
*  So there are these little spaces where murder can exist, right? It's justified self-defense [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3840.5200000000004s)]
*  And what if it's a a duel? [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3844.92s)]
*  No, then if both parties are consenting then it's not murder. Oh, it's it's it's uh, it's no victim. It's it's not murder. What would it be called? [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3847.0800000000004s)]
*  Just killing. Yeah [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3855.0s)]
*  So murder is the idea that one party is not consenting and I guess both parties are consenting to whatever this happens [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3856.6s)]
*  It's like a boxing match where one person ends up dying [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3861.0s)]
*  But I guess with a duel like the the explicit purpose is to kill one of us will die [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3863.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and if they're both consenting to do it assuming there's no coercion then I guess I guess maybe there's like a [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3867.16s)]
*  So I guess maybe sam's position is a little bit more optimistic about the human experience [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3872.36s)]
*  It's like hey [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3876.2s)]
*  We are internally good and we know the right thing to do and when we're put in situations where we're allowed to freely access [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3876.92s)]
*  Our our internal morality we will act right [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3883.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, and I agree with that and then but but also I have I have empathy for the other guy because it's like [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3886.2s)]
*  He might subscribe to this idea [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3892.3599999999997s)]
*  Like there's been a lot of times where we don't act right [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3893.64s)]
*  And we act horribly towards one another and then having this moral framework that's given by god or religion or whatever [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3896.52s)]
*  Is a is a constant reminder that we cannot, you know fall victim to our instinctual [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3902.68s)]
*  Uh desires in these motives in in in these moments, but sometimes they've used that [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3909.5s)]
*  Moral framework to do horrible things. That's that's why this is an interesting discussion [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3914.86s)]
*  I'm not saying that you're wrong about but that's why it is really interesting because there's so much evidence to us doing horrible shit [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3918.7000000000003s)]
*  and [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3924.7000000000003s)]
*  it would be nice if there was this framework that we could look back to and be like hey, hey, we're doing horrible shit because [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3925.9s)]
*  God says it or now I guess we have in america the constitution says it [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3931.1800000000003s)]
*  It seems like we need something to remind us constantly and that we can do a lot of justification for horrible behavior if we want [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3934.78s)]
*  And we can even use religion for horrible behavior, too [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3941.7400000000002s)]
*  I mean people have done it throughout history. It's happening right now, right? [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3944.3s)]
*  They're like murking these christians out there in syria and i'm sure that there's like a moral justification for that [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3947.82s)]
*  There's not this like boo murder. They're going nah [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3953.02s)]
*  You know the man upstairs justifies this in some way. Yeah [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3957.1800000000003s)]
*  I like I thought I I know a lot of these shows are like based on like dunking on one another which is kind of [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3960.38s)]
*  Unfortunate. I wish there was a lot more like good faith conversations for people online where it wasn't like i'm gonna win [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3966.36s)]
*  It's more like what do you feel? [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3972.22s)]
*  Oh, that's an interesting perspective and like I feel this way and then that person goes I can see why that's important [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3973.34s)]
*  Unfortunately, this is dunk culture that gets a click. Yeah, but I thought they set it up that way but the discussion is like [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3978.14s)]
*  No, it's good. It's it like here. Keep going. You have low reproductive birth rates [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3983.74s)]
*  I just don't see a justification for gay outside of it. Just feels good. Whoa pause. So whoa, that's okay. So [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3987.1s)]
*  Usually I think with at least in america the the feeling of hey this feels good [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=3996.3s)]
*  And this is good that we're talking about this mouse that is that like this feels good to go like we should let the experts speak [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4000.3s)]
*  But he goes he goes it's not like it's right or wrong [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4010.54s)]
*  It's just I don't feel a justification for it outside of this feels good [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4012.86s)]
*  So his I guess argument hinges on this idea just be as something feels good doesn't mean that is best for society [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4016.62s)]
*  And he'll he he makes more wild shit [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4025.02s)]
*  He came ready [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4030.4599999999996s)]
*  This guy came ready great in this I think we've even had this discussion here. It's like, okay you have people that are related [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4032.4599999999996s)]
*  Having sex without the fear of reproduction if they are consensual. Is that okay? [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4038.9399999999996s)]
*  It feels both good to both of them. They're adults they're consenting and it doesn't I guess negatively impact society [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4043.26s)]
*  Should we restrict their ability to do that? Yeah, it's a fire philosophical debate [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4049.82s)]
*  Yeah, like the one the first day in my philosophy class and like college. This is one of the questions [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4053.5800000000004s)]
*  They brought up. This is the what was it with dr small? Yeah, dr same sex incest. Yeah, is that [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4057.98s)]
*  unethical because same sex removes the fear of [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4063.0200000000004s)]
*  Producing a child that has some sort of issue. So what's wrong? So what's the problem now? [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4067.0200000000004s)]
*  This is where we go back to the o'connor argument where it's just like you have this innate feeling of boo [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4072.14s)]
*  Yeah, that's bad [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4076.62s)]
*  What does that come from? [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4078.8599999999997s)]
*  Is that because we've been told incest is that well, that's the thing. Have we been told it or do we innately feel? [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4080.62s)]
*  It's wrong. Like is it built into our personal constitution and you could argue on a biological basis that humans feel that it's wrong [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4086.8599999999997s)]
*  Why like through like pheromones? So like a person would be more attracted to a [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4094.9399999999996s)]
*  Like a dissimilar person then to a relative [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4099.58s)]
*  Levels of stuff like that. Okay, so like for the reproductive health of the society [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4102.86s)]
*  Most people would go to diversify their genetic lineage, but then you look at throughout history and probably them accept these guys [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4107.0199999999995s)]
*  I mean, yeah, dubbs entire family looks identical to one another so there's been a lot of [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4112.7s)]
*  Inbreeding in his family. It's kind of worked out for them. Maybe others it has it right, but there's a lot of similarity [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4117.0199999999995s)]
*  I mean like yeah, but they all have asthma so it's like they go to the bed [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4122.46s)]
*  How do you have asthma at that nose, right? [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4125.099999999999s)]
*  Get some oxygen in it's the it's the bend [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4127.26s)]
*  Anyway, I thought I thought this was an interesting discussion like it's cool to chew on these things [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4148.860000000001s)]
*  I don't know. What do you what is your take on? What do you think is what do you think determines our decision making of right and wrong? [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4154.7s)]
*  I think there is something innate [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4160.7s)]
*  I do think that there's like a biological natural law and like as someone that believes in god [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4162.139999999999s)]
*  I would like to believe that there is some type of like order that god put into the universe that people can come to know [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4166.54s)]
*  Without god. Yeah, but then additionally if you come to follow some type of faith background that those things are also instilled [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4171.42s)]
*  Okay [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4176.86s)]
*  But then I also think that those things get like antiquated over time [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4177.259999999999s)]
*  Like the levitical laws of like eating pork and stuff probably existed in a specific time frame where pork was very dangerous, right? [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4180.62s)]
*  And then as time has gone on it's no longer as dangerous. Sorry Jews and muslims [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4186.06s)]
*  And ethiopian christians apparently. Oh really? Yeah, there's like a bunch of people that don't eat pork [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4190.54s)]
*  Wow, which you started looking at how many people don't eat pork. Why are we eating this? [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4194.78s)]
*  But then I think like I don't know I think all the faiths that have persisted probably have a lot of roots of the same [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4200.38s)]
*  Things that help society prosper [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4205.66s)]
*  So you could make the argument [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4207.9800000000005s)]
*  that [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4210.0599999999995s)]
*  Reinforcing those beliefs might be the best thing for society at large [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4211.08s)]
*  To a point but we also live in a non-theocratic society [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4215.58s)]
*  Yes, so like as someone that lives in america that likes religious freedom [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4218.54s)]
*  I also don't want to be bound by the mandates of any specific religion [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4221.66s)]
*  Yes, whether that be islam or christianity or judaism, right? [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4225.419999999999s)]
*  So because it infringes on your personal freedom, right? [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4228.379999999999s)]
*  Like it would be nice if there was a catholic country that existed that had some type of catholic theocratic laws that if I so [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4231.339999999999s)]
*  Chose I could move to but I like to live in america where people can practice freely whatever they want [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4236.46s)]
*  I do as well [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4240.860000000001s)]
*  But he was looking at like I think he's chalking this up to like a leftist issue and maybe he has issues with leftist ideology [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4241.58s)]
*  And it's easy to like, you know reconstruct an argument afterwards and like place it on top of it [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4247.18s)]
*  But he's pointing at you know, birth rates declining and he's trying to say if you see more like left-leading ideology in countries [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4251.42s)]
*  You see birth rates declining and he's going okay [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4258.22s)]
*  Is this a like repercussion of this way of thinking where you just do what makes you feel good now? [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4260.62s)]
*  Maybe maybe you have less people and maybe society collapses hundreds from years now who fucking knows [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4266.46s)]
*  but [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4272.3s)]
*  I don't know if we build society simply to create more people, right? [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4273.58s)]
*  Yes, there's a way to make society so we just make more people and it is more beneficial for that specific thing [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4278.14s)]
*  But I don't know if that's the goal of civil society, right? [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4283.74s)]
*  I could also argue this is I think a slippery slope argument [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4286.38s)]
*  like it seems fallacious on its onset to say like the logical conclusion of xyz philosophy is [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4289.18s)]
*  Decimation of a population because you can say the inverse that you know [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4294.7s)]
*  The logical conclusion of like a hyper religious society is going to be like oppression of women and gay people getting murdered [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4297.66s)]
*  You can make the exact same argument and yeah, just an oppressive way [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4302.78s)]
*  So to me i'm like it seems like kind of [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4306.7s)]
*  Misguided I don't know if that was intention, but like I think it's framed poorly. Yeah [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4309.42s)]
*  You can also go go you could also make the point that like uh is a declining birth rate or a or a [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4313.42s)]
*  Increasing birth rate like positive for society. We don't know if it declines does society actually get better? [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4318.46s)]
*  There's more resources per person like does utopia happen because there's more [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4323.18s)]
*  Resources per person or is it an increasing birth rate? Does that actually make the earth die faster? [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4328.38s)]
*  Like we don't we don't actually know i've always wondered that i'm like maybe this is [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4333.42s)]
*  Just the order of things and we're just like leveling out [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4337.26s)]
*  Yeah, like we used to put so much emphasis on have as many kids as possible now like look at the [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4340.06s)]
*  Little resources we all have and everybody's complaining. So maybe this is just like a bouncing itself out. Yeah, it's a leveling the natural leveling [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4345.26s)]
*  Which even that idea I think comes out of like agrarian societies and shit and this is from someone whose parents are seven kids [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4351.34s)]
*  Yeah, but like i'm pretty sure even prior to like pastoralist and agrarian societies people were having like three or four kids [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4356.7s)]
*  Yeah, like women were having like their periods like 18 or 19. Yeah, so they had it way later [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4361.74s)]
*  Yeah, they were having it later [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4365.9800000000005s)]
*  And so like in hunter gather societies, they still have them later and then typically women breastfeed the whole time [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4367.18s)]
*  They were admitting like prolactin and estrogen so they weren't able to get pregnant for longer periods of time [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4371.74s)]
*  They would separate the kids. That's an important component to talk about when a woman is breastfeeding [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4376.46s)]
*  It's much harder for her to get pregnant [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4380.7s)]
*  So if you're breastfeeding for two three four years then you have a five-year gap in between kids [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4382.139999999999s)]
*  And if you had four kids think about that, that's 20 years of baby making so if you start at 18 [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4386.46s)]
*  You're done at 38 [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4391.9s)]
*  And you might have three four you have three or four kids [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4393.5s)]
*  That's assuming every pregnancy went to turn like that's a really interesting point [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4395.58s)]
*  And I talked to an anthropologist and said like it's actually potentially more beneficial for children to have more individualized time with the parent [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4398.94s)]
*  So like having multiple kids really close together could be detrimental for the development of kids that giving them more [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4405.34s)]
*  Undisputed attention for like four or five years is actually better for like the survival of the species [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4410.6s)]
*  I I mean that makes a lot of sense and this is in hunter gather societies where people are just like eating off the land [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4415.9800000000005s)]
*  And living off land 100. I mean like you you have a kid right now [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4420.3s)]
*  You know how much attention they require like they're walking around you need to walk with them every single second every day [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4423.18s)]
*  If you have one that's five and they kind of know the rules where they should go [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4427.740000000001s)]
*  They can almost like help out a little bit with the little kid [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4431.42s)]
*  They're not looking after them, but they can teach the kids something like that [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4433.740000000001s)]
*  You can ask them to hand you something and you can look after the other kid [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4436.78s)]
*  But looking at two looking after two kids that are under three years old [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4439.179999999999s)]
*  I mean that that's the it takes a village shit. Like that's where you need grandma [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4443.42s)]
*  Yeah, or you need grandpa. You need somebody else looking after those kids. It takes a lot of attention [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4446.86s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4451.0199999999995s)]
*  So I think about this question a lot like what is what does it mean to actually be human and what is best for humans? [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4451.74s)]
*  And I think people go back and they go like oh like 2000 years ago [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4456.46s)]
*  But like that's still like a very recent development in humanity [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4459.34s)]
*  So like is it potentially we go 10 000 years ago like homo sapiens been walking around the way we are for like what? [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4462.54s)]
*  100 000 years. Yeah, so like 2 000 years is just a blip [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4467.34s)]
*  So like have humans existed for most of the time [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4470.700000000001s)]
*  In the way that we were 10 000 years ago living walking around having sex eating a mango [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4473.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you know what I mean? Like is that what most of humanity has been? [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4478.14s)]
*  So then when it comes like moral frameworks, like should we be trying to go back farther than we're really looking at it? [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4481.02s)]
*  You know what I mean? Wait explain that like should we be going back to like, okay [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4486.54s)]
*  What are humans really supposed to be doing? [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4490.62s)]
*  Okay, so like oh we should have a bunch of kids because that's what people did a thousand years ago [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4492.14s)]
*  I was like well actually that is a blip in the overall scope where for most of human history people are having three or four [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4495.82s)]
*  Yeah, once we started farming. Yeah, then we start going let's have seven so you have societal explosion [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4502.14s)]
*  Yeah, also you need people to work the farm the land [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4506.62s)]
*  So it's like it's like your retirement policy almost you have you have one kid [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4509.98s)]
*  How are they going to take care of their family and you and your wife when you're too old to do anything? [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4513.18s)]
*  You have seven [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4517.82s)]
*  You can mitigate that risk across seven different bodies. That's the that's the [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4519.26s)]
*  Like big issue with the declining birth rate in certain countries [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4523.820000000001s)]
*  They have aging populations that no one is there to take this is like japan, right? [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4526.3s)]
*  South korea and certain other countries. I mean every developed country basically [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4530.14s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4533.1s)]
*  I mean america is going to run into it in the next like 50 days [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4533.58s)]
*  And so so again the concern is that there won't be enough or that the burden of the parents and the grandparents? [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4536.3s)]
*  Will be on the grandkids and they just won't have enough resources to [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4542.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and then protect provide yeah, and they also won't have enough time for themselves to to benefit society [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4547.5s)]
*  They're taking they're spending all their time taking care of an older. That's right. They have to develop a business [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4553.5s)]
*  They have to create something they have to uh, so quomo was just trying to help out second [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4557.179999999999s)]
*  What he said quomo was just trying to help out wait, what was quomo doing now? [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4563.0199999999995s)]
*  He put all the fucking old people in the yeah. He's like, yeah, we can't pay for these fucking things anymore [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4567.5s)]
*  Accelerations, john, he's trying to run for mayor now. Oh, yeah, you think he's got it? [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4571.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean on name alone. He'll get the he'll get the push to the mayor. That is the thing about politics [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4576.94s)]
*  We forget pretty quickly. Yeah, it's we get pretty quick and like there are certain names, especially in [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4581.66s)]
*  I mean at least new york, but definitely in politics in general where like people go [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4587.82s)]
*  Oh, they're familiar with the name like you see this person [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4591.419999999999s)]
*  You know what you're gonna get and then you see some other random human being and if he doesn't create enough buzz [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4594.139999999999s)]
*  If he doesn't have like superstar power [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4598.62s)]
*  Like trump had superstar power so he could kind of muscle his way in [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4601.0199999999995s)]
*  But if it's quomo versus random name person that used to be the comp troller of the city [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4604.94s)]
*  Yeah, colma's blowing that guy out there [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4610.78s)]
*  Yeah [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4613.58s)]
*  So he would run against adams [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4614.7s)]
*  Yeah, is adam's even still of course. That's the boy every other week. He's getting arrested. No, I saw him at zero bond finger [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4617.34s)]

*  This is what we need new york needs the mayor adams [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4635.26s)]
*  He likes to you know, talk to his constituents [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4639.98s)]
*  He's acutely aware of what the women in new york city [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4645.42s)]
*  I mean would you not if you not married you the mayor of new york, you're not gonna dip in some strain every once in a while [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4649.58s)]
*  Only a hundred thousand from the street [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4655.34s)]
*  Like holy the fuck [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4657.34s)]
*  If he came back with a new hairline i'd be like listen motherfuckers compromise [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4661.58s)]
*  We want our presidents be married mayors no, yeah, I want you outside [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4666.78s)]
*  I think we need adams on the pod bro, because I don't know if we can let quomo be the mayor [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4670.860000000001s)]
*  I could set that up. I think we need adams on the pod. Yeah, we fire [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4674.860000000001s)]
*  I think we need that we need to have a real talk. What would you ask him? [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4678.22s)]
*  What do you want to know? He might be a little afraid to come up here though. No, that motherfucker got no fear [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4680.46s)]
*  He got I was a police officer energy, yeah, thank you because he was [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4685.26s)]
*  But they have a different confidence, you know, and uh, no, I don't think he's scared [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4690.3s)]
*  I got that confidence that they can do whatever and get away with the confidence [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4694.3s)]
*  He's away with it. Yeah. Yeah, we're not talking about no more crazy. What did he even do? [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4699.18s)]
*  I don't know [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4704.86s)]
*  No [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4707.42s)]
*  It really is the beauty of headlines is like it's like kickbacks to open some turkish like [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4713.98s)]
*  I think it was construction for the turkish embassy or whatever like that and it's like low-key bilge embassy, bro [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4720.46s)]
*  Like couple free flights a hundred thousand solicitation of a contribution by foreign national and bribery. Yep [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4727.0199999999995s)]
*  So [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4732.94s)]
*  That's how you feel about that [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4735.0199999999995s)]
*  Like how politicians not doing that that's the question. Yeah, so here's the concern [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4738.0599999999995s)]
*  The concern I imagine is this [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4743.5s)]
*  If you're a foreign country, right? [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4746.139999999999s)]
*  And you see a rising star in the american political system [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4748.54s)]
*  If i'm a foreign country that I want and I want any influence in american politics at all and that is advantageous to foreign countries [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4753.419999999999s)]
*  Obviously you get in bed with these guys when they're real young like before they're even mayor of new york [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4759.58s)]
*  And you got a little thing on them that you're not really going to talk about and they're not really sweating because they got these [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4765.34s)]
*  You know political dreams and hopefully they get to be president one day. I mean if you're going to be mayor of new york [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4769.5s)]
*  There's no way you're not thinking I could be president. Oh, yeah, it's the next logical step, right? [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4773.9s)]
*  So if you're turkey if you're china if you're qatar if you're anything, right you go [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4779.02s)]
*  All right, let's see if we can just you know, talk to that guy. Let's throw a little money in this campaign [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4783.9800000000005s)]
*  Let's do whatever we can and then if he does rise to this political superstardom [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4788.3s)]
*  He does become president then that's a phone call away and you're like listen [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4792.14s)]
*  We would really appreciate if you don't make these tariffs too crazy, you know [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4795.820000000001s)]
*  We're boys remember back in the day we gave you that 100 grand and that's your way of going [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4798.9400000000005s)]
*  We don't want to make this a big problem. It's like getting it on the seed ramp [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4803.1s)]
*  I mean if i'm another country that's what i'm doing. I'm looking at every young political star potentially and i'm going [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4808.38s)]
*  I love what you're doing. How can I help not even trying to bribe you? How can I help? [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4814.06s)]
*  And then you know become the friends. Yeah, wow, so we can let him be mayor. He can't be president. That's crazy [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4818.3s)]
*  He's already bribed by the turks right for 100 grants, but mayor I like [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4823.740000000001s)]
*  Mayor I like someone say our president is do you know russian asset? I don't know some people say is he still a russian [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4828.54s)]
*  debunked I think that's what sauger said [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4834.3s)]
*  We trust the last person that spoke [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4837.900000000001s)]
*  Who's he supported by now who's [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4842.14s)]
*  It's actually it was it [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4844.860000000001s)]
*  No, no [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4847.5s)]
*  This guy eating carol went on rogue with my mustache and talked so much shit about how [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4855.5s)]
*  Israel is influencing like it was like epstein shit. It feels like there was no new conspiracies that were brought up [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4860.94s)]
*  It was like the same conspiracies we've heard for the last decade. Yeah, but it's winter [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4867.179999999999s)]
*  But what's it's big juicy ones like that? [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4871.74s)]
*  Still not fucking answered we never get an answer that bro. Nine eleven. We should get an answer. We know who did nine eleven [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4874.139999999999s)]
*  Yo, dove you gotta y'all gotta do I know you're doing some nasty work [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4884.3s)]
*  When black people are starting to say now that motherfucker spin Jews you gotta be careful [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4893.66s)]
*  Yeah, okay jews made the little ndw acp or whatever thinking black people gonna ride from so [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4897.9s)]
*  We we we had us for a while, but he is cooking right now [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4902.94s)]
*  Call me what is he doing? [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4907.9s)]
*  What is he actually doing? [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4909.66s)]
*  What do you mean? Like what is he saying? Like what is going so viral on twitter specifically? [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4911.259999999999s)]
*  Because I just see twitter and it's like it's back to like everything is the jews fault [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4915.179999999999s)]
*  So but what specifically is he outing? What is he what connections is? [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4919.9s)]
*  I don't know all the specifics [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4923.58s)]
*  But the thing that people just keep trying they can't seem to separate is that he's saying the israeli government and everybody [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4924.7s)]
*  ties that [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4932.22s)]
*  By anti-semitism and he's talking about all jews and I don't think he's doing that right [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4933.66s)]
*  But that's the way it seems like online [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4938.3s)]
*  That's the only thing that I don't like because it's like he's really clear and just being like oh it's [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4940.46s)]
*  The israeli government that's doing all these things and then everybody's like, oh anti-semitism. He's saying jews cause [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4945.5s)]
*  Maybe because the rest of the internet's just tying the two together. Yeah, but he's not saying that [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4951.18s)]
*  So this is the tricky thing is like he's you should be able to criticize every single government on the planet [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4956.700000000001s)]
*  You should be able to criticize. You should be able to criticize China. Whatever the fuck you want. You should be able to criticize [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4961.740000000001s)]
*  Now it is tricky right because jews in america and jews around the world naturally are very supportive of israel [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4967.9800000000005s)]
*  So sometimes that support gets conflated. You're like are you supporting that country because they've allegedly done those things [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4974.860000000001s)]
*  Or are you supporting them because you like a jewish homeland and you feel safe there and you've been reading all the books forever [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4982.86s)]
*  And you just want that place to exist. So I think that there is a separation there [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4989.339999999999s)]
*  But if you're somebody who hates jews and you hear that rhetoric from ian you're going see this is why I hate them [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4992.62s)]
*  Because of all this shit, I can see that right so it is a [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=4998.86s)]
*  but the thing that i've seen like kind of [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5002.62s)]
*  Explode the most is this idea of like foreign influence, right? Which is a very reasonable [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5005.259999999999s)]
*  Discussion to have like if you feel like other countries are influencing america [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5011.9s)]
*  We should be able to look into that influence and be critical of that influence [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5016.62s)]
*  Right now that's not to say that we shouldn't take foreign investment. Give us all your fucking money [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5019.82s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? If saudi arabia wants to buy a trillion dollars worth of planes that don't work [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5023.74s)]
*  Absolutely, please [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5027.66s)]
*  We love to sell you planes that don't work. We literally sell them planes with the technology that doesn't make them as good as they can be [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5028.94s)]
*  Oh really? Yeah. Oh, it's like go karts [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5034.54s)]
*  We put the governor on this [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5037.9s)]
*  Because in case you act up we need a 200 mile per hour plane to take you out. Oh, that's fine [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5042.379999999999s)]
*  I believe that's the understanding. Oh, I think the f-35 is sick as hell. That's we're not selling them [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5046.7s)]
*  We're not selling the f-35s [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5050.379999999999s)]
*  We're not giving anybody but I think you give them like f-16s you give them the top of the shit [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5052.139999999999s)]
*  We're not giving nobody those f-35s. Hold on. Hold on. We know something. We don't know we have plenty of people that have f-35s [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5056.379999999999s)]
*  We don't other countries don't have the f-22. I believe the f-35 uk has it [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5062.7s)]
*  Uh dick israel has it. Uh, I think [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5067.82s)]
*  I like [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5071.9s)]
*  I don't think six countries have it. Yes, the united states does sell f-35 lightning to fighter jets to other countries. Don't do that to me mark [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5077.58s)]
*  Yeah, I mean dove is a little autistic about the planes. He loves the fucking plane. So I trust him with this kind of information [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5083.98s)]
*  but I think so here's I think the the tricky thing right is like it looks like there's this influence, right and [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5089.58s)]
*  a lot of people in america like [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5095.66s)]
*  They make this this big concern [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5097.98s)]
*  How do I even say that because I don't want to discredit people who care about what's happening in gaza [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5100.78s)]
*  Like I think there are definitely a lot of people in america around the world care about what's happening in gaza [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5104.78s)]
*  And they're like hey this feels excessive and they don't want people dying, right? [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5108.379999999999s)]
*  I also think there have been plenty of other times throughout history where like america has been [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5112.78s)]
*  Responsible for the murder of tons of people million people in iraq and like yes, there are americans who are concerned [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5117.24s)]
*  They're like this is fucked up. We don't like this. This is horrible, but there's a little part of americans [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5122.78s)]
*  We're like, yeah, but the gas is like 250 [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5127.66s)]
*  Right. So I think there's a little part of this discussion which is kind of missing which is like what are we getting? [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5129.98s)]
*  out of this tragedy we're supporting this tragedy, but what do we get and [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5135.18s)]
*  I I think it's on like israel to be honest to explain if if we're best friends if we're you're you're you're our closest ally [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5140.3s)]
*  Or whatever it is like you it's up to you to explain to americans if you want to continue to get that support [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5147.58s)]
*  Why we're so close? [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5153.34s)]
*  What is the information now I hear a lot of people when I ask they're like, uh, we get um [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5154.46s)]
*  What is it called? [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5159.74s)]
*  Intelligence. Yeah, okay. So intelligence can essentially mean like hey, there's this terror attack that's gonna happen [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5161.1s)]
*  You guys should do something about it [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5167.42s)]
*  Let's let's operate in best case scenario, right? [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5169.74s)]
*  And I know there's already people in there like oh you're fucking just bootlicking the jews or whatever the fuck it is [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5172.7s)]
*  I'm just saying best case scenario [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5177.1s)]
*  They've given us information to thwart [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5179.74s)]
*  20 more 9-elevens, let's say [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5181.9800000000005s)]
*  Because I doubt there's one planned attack on america, right? There's probably a bunch. Yeah, so let's say they've given us [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5184.62s)]
*  Information that stops 20 others [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5191.08s)]
*  They can't tell america by the way [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5193.1s)]
*  We gave you the information to stop these attacks because now you're going to give up [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5195.58s)]
*  Those people that are embedded in those like terror institutions or even the country's governments that are playing these attacks [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5199.74s)]
*  So now you remove your intelligence [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5205.9s)]
*  So there is a version where america is giving them this amount of money a year [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5208.46s)]
*  And we're getting intelligence is valuable to us, but you can't communicate that to american people [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5212.54s)]
*  Okay [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5218.14s)]
*  Well, you need to figure out something else to communicate even if they did communicate I feel like people wouldn't believe it [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5218.7s)]
*  That's also imagine they put out like, you know a news headline the israel times [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5222.7s)]
*  They're like israel stops terror attack in america. Yeah, everyone be like, yeah. All right, of course you did [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5226.3s)]
*  You know, you're just saying it because it didn't happen [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5230.7s)]
*  But if you are because here's the reality of the world like they control the media [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5233.34s)]
*  But but this is around the world is like once something happens [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5238.54s)]
*  like [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5242.14s)]
*  The government is always going to be a reflection of the people right? So like if there isn't support for something in america [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5243.98s)]
*  You will not get money eventually [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5251.58s)]
*  wait [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5254.94s)]
*  There's waning support in america for the war in ukraine. Okay, right americans are kind of suffering [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5256.7s)]
*  They feel like they don't have money here [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5261.42s)]
*  And then we're like, why are we sending billions of dollars over this other country? [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5263.74s)]
*  I don't really know anybody from there. I don't really understand how it's an existential threat to us personally [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5266.7s)]
*  Like I don't get it and I can't afford eggs [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5271.0199999999995s)]
*  So like if any billions of dollars is going anywhere send it send it over here first [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5272.78s)]
*  I think that's the feeling a lot of americans have I think if the economy was absolutely flourishing [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5277.259999999999s)]
*  We don't give a fuck about us aid. We don't care about the plays [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5281.66s)]
*  They're doing in the philippines or whatever the fuck they want. But in america when times are tough naturally [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5284.46s)]
*  And I think there's a very reasonable response. We start looking at where the money's going [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5290.86s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like if you're not spending a lot of time with your dad [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5294.7s)]
*  But your dad's out here doing all this other shit you have some resentment towards all those other things your dad's doing you want to hang out? [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5297.26s)]
*  So I think in those moments it's up to those countries that are getting help to show us the value that they're bringing to us [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5303.820000000001s)]
*  You have to find a way to communicate that value. Otherwise americans start feeling taken advantage of [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5310.860000000001s)]
*  Now we might not be and you have to leave that space open. I think people are like [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5315.820000000001s)]
*  They're they're determined that they know exactly what's going on. There's a little bit of an addiction to conspiracy in general [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5321.18s)]
*  They're very exciting and fun. They make people feel really smart. Like you know something nobody else knows. That's the quickest way to feeling smart [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5326.38s)]
*  but [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5333.74s)]
*  I think there is a burden on any country that we're giving money to it could be ukraine. It could be [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5334.62s)]
*  Israel it could be fucking any other country [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5340.06s)]
*  There's a burden on them to understand what they're bringing. I think partially that was the mineral deal they were doing with ukraine [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5342.86s)]
*  I think it was like I think it was like listen [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5348.9400000000005s)]
*  We need to you need to give us a reason why we should continue giving you weapons [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5351.74s)]
*  And that would have maybe pacified the american people we'd be like, oh, yeah, we got all their minerals [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5356.22s)]
*  So honestly, we're getting shit cheap and it's actually beneficial to us [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5360.14s)]
*  Yeah, so I think israel need to figure out what that mineral shit is. Yeah [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5363.58s)]
*  And just and and you have to do that for a geopolitical reason [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5367.26s)]
*  Because you have to convince the american public it is worth sending our money that can make our eggs cheaper or whatever [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5370.7s)]
*  We believe it doesn't matter if that's reality. It's perception [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5376.22s)]
*  What do we believe to be true? Yeah [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5379.34s)]
*  That you got to figure that out because it feels like in america right now that support is low and when the economy's tough [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5382.14s)]
*  The ideological wars don't go as far like you like talk. Can you explain that is great? [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5386.78s)]
*  Like things are expensive and i'm having a hard time buying food or supporting my family [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5391.5s)]
*  I don't give a fuck about communism. I don't give a fuck. I don't care about terrorism [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5395.18s)]
*  I don't care about none of these supporting democracy [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5398.62s)]
*  You're like who cares like that that is a place of privilege where we could worry about your issues over my house is communist [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5400.7s)]
*  We're all split in one omelet [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5405.900000000001s)]
*  This is hard like in fact i'm focused on the communism here not over in like vietnam or whatever [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5408.139999999999s)]
*  Like let's do this 100 and so a second the economy gets tight. Everyone's like, all right. Where's the where's the money going? [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5412.46s)]
*  Yeah, I do think there's some of the frustration in gaza is that and maybe there is but i'm missing it [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5417.42s)]
*  But I don't see enough jewish people speaking out against what the israel government is doing like i'm not subscribed to like [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5424.0599999999995s)]
*  Uh, what's I don't know one of your institutions corrects or something. Yeah, but I just don't see it [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5431.42s)]
*  So it's like it seems like all jewish people are in support of what's going on over there because no one's speaking out against it [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5437.099999999999s)]
*  That is and then yeah, that's an interesting that's an interesting point too, which is like because even within israel, it's it's quite divided [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5442.94s)]
*  Right, so but that is an interesting thing where it's like if you feel under attack [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5449.0199999999995s)]
*  Your knee-jerk reaction is to support the side that you believe is defending you [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5453.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but by doing that you're supporting the actions of the government, which a lot of americans feel is like, okay [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5457.099999999999s)]
*  You did the job and now you're twisting the knife like now it feels like it's wrong now [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5463.1s)]
*  It feels like it's going too far. Yeah, now you're asking jews to like defend everything ever but here [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5468.78s)]
*  Well, here's the other thing. Here's the other thing. You can make this [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5473.74s)]
*  Oh, no [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5476.06s)]
*  Yeah, you could it could be a slippery soap and I can understand why they wouldn't want to be like [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5476.38s)]
*  All right, we're doing this bad and then we're like see and now what else are you doing bad? [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5480.54s)]
*  I can see that I morally prove myself to every person that I meet but I think [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5483.9s)]
*  Americans we did it once we realized hey, there's no weapons of mass destruction. We are here for no reason [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5487.66s)]
*  This is wrong. Let's stop this. I think we called ourselves out on that shit [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5491.98s)]
*  I put a post up [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5499.179999999999s)]
*  Black squared it and shit [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5501.74s)]
*  It took us a while [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5506.94s)]
*  Took us to march [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5511.58s)]
*  But we were calling out we were saying like this war is wrong [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5514.219999999999s)]
*  Like I think the people were calling well saying the war war was wrong once we found out there weren't weapons of mass [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5517.179999999999s)]
*  Well, here's the thing. You don't think so. There's a lot of people that aren't there's a lot of people that aren't going to say is wrong [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5522.139999999999s)]
*  But another thing that we got to decide is like we can't get caught [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5526.7s)]
*  We can't get caught up in right and wrong [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5531.42s)]
*  We have to get caught up in perception [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5533.98s)]
*  Perception is reality [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5536.84s)]
*  And this is important for countries to understand the perception of zelinski coming into the oval office not wearing a suit [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5539.0199999999995s)]
*  Doing like a vague threat about it could affect you guys and like being contentious with trump and [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5546.94s)]
*  And jd vance the perception to americans most of who aren't really informed about the conflict was like hold up son [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5552.94s)]
*  I gave you 400 billion dollars and this is how you talk in our white house [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5559.42s)]
*  Cut the money off now. There is much more nuance to what's happening in that war [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5563.74s)]
*  There's much more nuance to what's going on in the world [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5568.62s)]
*  Like if you talk to people that are from the countries that are around russia [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5571.179999999999s)]
*  They get taught every single day in school like russia still thinks estonia is part of russia [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5574.86s)]
*  You know all those countries like we might be russia one day [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5579.58s)]
*  So like they have a different perspective but it's up to those countries to understand american perspective [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5582.54s)]
*  It don't matter what your reality is [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5588.38s)]
*  It matters if you want the money and you want the support you have to meet us where our reality is [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5590.38s)]
*  you know, this is we get into these discussions all the time and [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5595.42s)]
*  in um [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5598.62s)]
*  American culture where it's like about like the trans debate or something like that and you know [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5599.82s)]
*  Somebody goes I don't want trans women competing against women in sports and a lot of like left-leaning people will be like [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5603.5s)]
*  Oh, that's a red herring and that's not actually a real issue. It's like, okay, that might be what you feel [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5608.7s)]
*  But you're not addressing [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5614.14s)]
*  What these people feel it's like you get it's like you do something to upset your wife [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5616.06s)]
*  And then she's she's like that upset me and you're going but that's not a real issue [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5620.86s)]
*  Does that work ever? [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5625.42s)]
*  No, but I paid for the apartment exactly [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5627.1s)]
*  Exactly, they don't want to hear that shit, right? [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5629.5s)]
*  You have to meet people where they feel so a lot of times people get caught up in these like logical arguments and like [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5630.78s)]
*  Oh, but america actually did this which is just as bad as that [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5635.98s)]
*  That might be true and factually true [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5639.58s)]
*  But the reality of what we live in is the perception is off and you need perception on your side for the support [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5642.219999999999s)]
*  That's going to allow you to continue [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5649.0199999999995s)]
*  I guess doing whatever you want to do for your country [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5651.5s)]
*  Then you're battling the emotional volatility of a populace rather than the logical [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5654.46s)]
*  Coherence of the leadership welcome to geopolitics my boy, but then you would hope like okay [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5658.54s)]
*  We're dealing with like the logical leaders that are going to support what's best for their people despite them not knowing what's best for them [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5663.1s)]
*  I I don't think we're dealing with though [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5668.620000000001s)]
*  I think we're dealing with I think they're also reacting to the emotional volatility in their countries [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5670.38s)]
*  like I think I don't think it's surprising that like [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5674.860000000001s)]
*  once this war starts ratcheting up putin starts going back to the orthodox church and talks about like how important it is [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5677.5s)]
*  To be in church in church of the foundation of family when apparently before that you never even saw him in one [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5683.42s)]
*  So if you're gearing up to war you want god on your side [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5688.780000000001s)]
*  You know like he's he's making emotional moves [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5692.46s)]
*  Trump makes emotional moves all the time people don't trust the food put the guy who says the food is bad as the leader of the food [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5696.22s)]
*  That's what we did in america, right? [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5702.780000000001s)]
*  Like we don't trust the alphabet agencies put the chick who says that these alphabet agencies [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5704.22s)]
*  Are not working the best interests of the people in charge of the alphabet agencies like these are emotional reactions [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5709.98s)]
*  Whether or not they'll be fruitful we're gonna see [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5716.54s)]
*  But you have to be aware of what people are thinking and you can't just go [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5719.74s)]
*  Uh, you guys are stupid. It's like all right. Keep saying that you're gonna lose money [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5723.26s)]
*  I think that's like the skill of a leader [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5727.1s)]
*  It's like this is a movie. So it's probably complete bullshit, but [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5729.9s)]
*  I've used this reference before but uh [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5733.18s)]
*  I forget who came over was like the king of england like get support for the americans like the king came over and like [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5735.18s)]

*  Oh, man, was it fdr told him is like yo you gotta [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5742.700000000001s)]
*  If you want americans who are german immigrants and italian immigrants to go to war against germany and italy [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5746.46s)]
*  To go to war against their relatives their cousins their uncles [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5752.860000000001s)]
*  You need to convince us that you are like us that you are more like us than they are [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5756.700000000001s)]
*  You need to eat the hot dog [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5761.66s)]
*  You need to wear some regular shit and eat a hot dog don't act like some king [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5763.58s)]
*  That we fought wars to get away from you need to feel like you're one of the boys [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5767.26s)]
*  So you got this king who would even even with a knife and fork and perfect manners going. All right [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5771.5s)]
*  Let me scarf a hot dog [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5776.54s)]
*  And that's how simple americans were like that. We gotta die for him. He's like exquisite. That's what i'm saying [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5778.22s)]

*  That's you with the corn on record score [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5786.62s)]
*  That should have me dying [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5790.3s)]
*  The funny is probably somebody said uh, so someone said, uh, so [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5792.46s)]
*  Someone said yeah. Yeah, I bet you eat the snickers, uh from the top down so you feel the veins [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5796.06s)]
*  Damn [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5802.62s)]
*  That is how I eat it though [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5804.78s)]
*  How else do you eat a snickers bro? So so what what do you think we do in these types of situations like [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5807.02s)]
*  Yeah, what do you do when there's like waning sentiment put yourself in the shoes of another government [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5813.34s)]
*  You can put yourself in shoes of israel ukraine whatever depends what cards you have to know how to play for example [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5817.66s)]
*  like i mean if you're china [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5821.98s)]
*  Then all of a sudden your cards open up way more because why you have you have control little tick tock and control [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5823.98s)]
*  Not necessarily how people feel from the messaging you tell them but rather what you subvert into the uh into the content of the app [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5829.419999999999s)]
*  What about america? Well, no real quick just on shit just on this one. This is really interesting. It's like [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5835.339999999999s)]
*  Uh right now there's this distrust of media, right? Like if there's any reporting that's like [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5839.9s)]
*  protecting israel, right the knee-jerk reaction from people who are critical of israel is [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5845.16s)]
*  Yeah, but they control the media right so you can write it off immediately [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5850.86s)]
*  The subversive nature of tiktok is that it's every day people in their bathroom [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5856.54s)]
*  Just saying some shit and it pops up on your phone. You don't see some news ticker [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=5862.379999999999s)]

*  Now let's get back to the show. That's all i'm trying to say like perception is important [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6398.400000000001s)]
*  There are so many people online who will give you every single like statistical fact and they'll be like yeah [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6402.08s)]

*  We don't care about that. You are dealing with emotional people. There's that jonathan hype book. It's called the righteous mind. Yeah [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6410.8s)]
*  read that shit [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6417.76s)]
*  Read that shit. Okay, because you're trying to like logically [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6419.36s)]
*  Address what people are going through and just like arguing with your wife that shit ain't gonna work [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6424.08s)]
*  Yeah, you can't reason people out of a position they didn't reason into in the first place. Yeah [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6427.92s)]
*  100 we are your wife. You got to treat everybody like your wife [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6432.16s)]
*  Yeah, especially on the geopolitical stage. You could do the strong man shit, but then you got to be able to bang out [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6435.6s)]
*  Not everybody is strong. Yeah people try to do this during like george floyd and shit [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6441.12s)]
*  Well, they were like oh black people like actually technically cops kill you guys the same as other people. How'd that make you feel? [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6444.8s)]
*  Like shit, yeah, exactly [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6451.76s)]
*  You go, you know, you don't go. Oh, those are the stats. Well all [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6453.12s)]
*  And all lives matter like like come on bro, you know, yeah [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6456.0s)]
*  So it's like you need to be met emotionally you need something to acknowledge like yo, it does seem fucked up [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6459.2s)]
*  I get why you guys feel that way 100 like I see these videos and it's fucking disgusting [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6463.92s)]
*  It's terrifying right and then you could also go to cops and be like listen. It's hard to be you [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6469.5199999999995s)]
*  It's hard to make those decisions in the moment. Like that's a fucking tough job. Like you're going out there. We're an armed public [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6474.24s)]
*  You don't know who got a gun and who doesn't in america like that's a scary fucking place to be [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6480.0s)]
*  You start there but nuance is uncomfortable it is very uncomfortable [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6484.799999999999s)]
*  But it is more comfortable if you at least meet somebody where they're feeling [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6488.4s)]
*  Like if you acknowledge what they're feeling and not make them feel like a retard for it, which is like what our [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6492.639999999999s)]
*  I don't even know if it's like our political rhetoric has become it's just this like dunk on economy. It's like you're stupid because [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6498.0s)]
*  you know, i'm right because it does require a lot of like [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6504.639999999999s)]
*  uh [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6508.08s)]
*  And like empathy to be able to be like hey I feel for what black people have gone through historically and currently in america [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6508.8s)]
*  But also I feel for what cops are going through. Yeah, and it's hard to feel like oh [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6514.56s)]
*  I understand what you know ukraine's going through but also understand what russia's going through [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6517.92s)]
*  I understand what gaza is going through. I also understand what israel is going. Yeah [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6520.96s)]
*  Do you think it would help if like a prominent jewish person came out? It's like hey [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6523.76s)]
*  You guys don't understand [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6527.52s)]
*  we've been at [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6529.04s)]
*  War with these people for a really long time. Yes. Maybe the government has been has gone a little heavy-handed with the response, but [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6531.12s)]
*  Until you're in it. You really don't get it. So you think that would help any sentiment? [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6538.8s)]
*  My concern is you can't start any discussion with you don't understand. Okay. Well put it differently [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6542.320000000001s)]
*  I think I think that hey we got attacked [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6548.88s)]
*  like our response [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6552.4800000000005s)]
*  You might deem it as excessive but we feel this is what's necessary in order to like [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6555.52s)]
*  End this conflict that's been going on for all these years in my again. I don't know but my estimation [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6561.92s)]
*  It doesn't feel like they're very concerned with the perception of what's happening [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6567.36s)]
*  Yeah, and that's what i'm saying. Like I think people need to speak out more to help with that perception [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6571.28s)]
*  Yeah, and I think that there's like a lot of like because without speaking out we feel gaslit like [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6576.16s)]
*  Oh, we can't say anything because you're just going to call us anti-semitic and not us. I'm just trying to yes [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6582.32s)]
*  Yes, that that would potentially be thrown out a hundred percent. Yeah, it's a it's a really tricky situation [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6587.44s)]
*  I don't know what I think that the what people want to feel the people who are really against this war [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6592.24s)]
*  What they want to feel is that they're right that the war is bad and it's wrong and what's horrible what's happening [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6597.5199999999995s)]
*  So it's going to require somebody on that side going you're right. It's horrible. It's happening and this has gone too far [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6602.24s)]
*  And this is disgusting [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6608.5599999999995s)]
*  But we're still going to do it like that's a very tricky position [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6610.88s)]
*  Yeah, you know [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6613.5199999999995s)]
*  so it's like but again, I think a major component of this that nobody's talking to is americans not really knowing what we get out of [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6614.48s)]
*  to this support like [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6620.16s)]
*  What do we get out of it? What is the concern like if we found out that like [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6623.12s)]
*  you know [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6627.5199999999995s)]
*  Hamas was also behind all these potential terror attacks that were happening here and their base that organized and was doing that [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6629.04s)]
*  And that there was four different attacks that were about to happen [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6635.599999999999s)]
*  They were thwarted because of that intelligent blah blah then all of a sudden americans might go. Whoa. Whoa. Okay. Okay. Okay [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6637.839999999999s)]
*  We're under serious threat [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6643.12s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like we might feel under serious threat [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6645.12s)]
*  So we're like, all right if you got to bang out you got to bang out and we got you [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6647.28s)]
*  But I think americans are removed from that threat. I know 9-eleven was that long ago, but I think we are [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6650.32s)]
*  We're quite removed. We're definitely removed from the Exit Central threat of Russia. Like we just don't feel it [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6654.88s)]
*  I can't speak for everybody, but I [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6660.84s)]
*  Personally, I don't feel it. So we forget forget quick. I don't feel like Eric Adams running for me. Yeah, we forget [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6663.32s)]
*  Go [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6671.2s)]
*  Invade us when we got Eric. I'm not afraid not afraid [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6673.2s)]
*  So he'll have four Turkish airliners [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6676.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6685.24s)]
*  But then the question is what if they can't find a justification for why America needs to support Israel is [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6688.16s)]
*  It the is it a necessity for the state to then create propaganda or do they just say hey? [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6693.36s)]
*  Unfortunately, we don't have anything. So I think the concern right now is that like propaganda in its old form is [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6700.0s)]
*  No longer useful [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6707.400000000001s)]
*  Okay, useful meaning. No, sorry effective [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6709.32s)]
*  So like I don't think the I don't even know what the propaganda is anymore [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6712.84s)]
*  I like I don't even think they think it's effective [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6716.48s)]
*  But but like what is the propaganda that they're giving us? [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6718.4s)]
*  Like the only way the propaganda works is if you create a threat against me [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6721.96s)]
*  Like what is the concern for me? [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6727.32s)]
*  And I don't see that the only argument I see is like well America would would have done something ten times worse [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6729.36s)]
*  And has in the past it's like all right, but you not us [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6735.2s)]
*  like [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6738.8s)]
*  Okay, mm-hmm [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6741.52s)]
*  Yeah, so it's like [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6744.28s)]
*  if again I [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6746.64s)]
*  That's where I'm saying it's like you have to we have to feel an actual the propaganda has to induce an actual fear [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6749.64s)]
*  Which is what the propaganda for communism did mm-hmm like that's MacArthur ism or whatever happened like we're like looking for people and oh [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6755.2s)]
*  Are these Hollywood slubs that they're actually fucking communists? [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6762.0s)]
*  The American way is gonna be completely destroyed like there was real threat to America right now [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6765.04s)]
*  We don't feel threat from Hamas mm-hmm at all [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6770.64s)]
*  right and [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6774.96s)]
*  So the fact that we don't feel threat and we're supporting this thing which we're seeing all these videos and it's like horrifying [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6776.88s)]
*  And you're just like whoa so what is I don't even know if they're giving propaganda [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6782.92s)]
*  Like what is the but like what is the good useful propaganda? Yeah? [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6787.68s)]
*  I mean, I guess that's the point is that there isn't really yeah because Americans don't know why [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6791.4800000000005s)]
*  There's all the steak [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6796.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6798.4800000000005s)]
*  It's I mean so it's tricky and this is one of the things that like [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6801.320000000001s)]
*  We're talking about like how leaders got to get support for things [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6805.160000000001s)]
*  We're not talking about whether things are right or wrong right right or wrong is in you know the eyes of the person that's doing [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6808.08s)]
*  The doing right like I'm sure they feel justified. They're like look what happened to us [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6813.64s)]
*  We're responding to this attack, and I'm sure how much feels justified [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6817.92s)]
*  They're like look what has happened to us, and then we did that so both of them feel like they're in the right and the other [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6820.76s)]
*  Is in the wrong and we're sitting over here going [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6824.88s)]
*  What's this got to do with us? [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6827.400000000001s)]
*  Eggs are fucking $100 [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6829.400000000001s)]
*  Why'd I get 40 billion when eggs are $100 you know by 40 billion dollars worth eggs before we go do this shit? [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6831.400000000001s)]
*  Mm-hmm, so you need to massage if you want support you need to work on that [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6837.2s)]
*  Yeah, because if not you are gonna have so many people asking questions about this [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6842.16s)]
*  I think if the economy was absolutely flourishing everybody's rich and bitcoins at a hundred [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6846.36s)]
*  I don't even think we're looking about what's happening in Ukraine [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6851.400000000001s)]
*  I think everybody's trying to buy a G wag [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6853.8s)]
*  Everybody's trying to start up some business on Instagram like when the economy's doing well Americans. We don't even look outside [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6855.84s)]
*  We only look outside for vacation. We're not looking where the money goes [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6862.12s)]
*  It's like everybody gets robbed everybody who makes a lot of money like a like a like a athlete or a rapper or something like that [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6865.56s)]
*  Like a musician everybody gets robbed when they're making all the money. They don't realize it until they default on their house [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6871.64s)]
*  And then they're like well my money manager took five million and this person you don't notice that in the moment mm-hmm [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6878.36s)]
*  Yeah, when I was to pay taxes I'd like unsubscribe from HBO [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6885.84s)]
*  Look I just look to see what's going on [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6890.16s)]
*  But then HBO send me an email and be like you watch these shows this past year like all that's give me my propaganda [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=6891.72s)]

*  you know, Stephen a is [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7480.22s)]
*  He's that's a real one right there. No, a lot of people would be terrified of beefing with LeBron because of the leverage [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7482.22s)]
*  he has over the [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7488.54s)]
*  sports media, yeah, and [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7490.9400000000005s)]
*  Steven a don't give a fuck bro. It's actually interesting. I wonder if you cannot give a fuck more now that like [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7493.74s)]
*  Information is decentralized like he has his own podcast. Mm-hmm [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7501.82s)]
*  Like he doesn't need ESPN even if he has been was like, hey, that's the golden goose. Don't piss off LeBron [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7505.219999999999s)]
*  He'd be like, I just won't talk about over here. I'll just get all the ratings on my body [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7509.78s)]
*  Yeah, so I wonder if you're getting like a more honest version of sports journalism where back in the day [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7513.0199999999995s)]
*  It was very much curated [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7517.599999999999s)]
*  You need to get scoops you need to get all this stuff and he just got a hundred hundred M [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7519.14s)]
*  So they're not upset of what he's saying about LeBron. He said they're like, yeah run it up run [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7523.1s)]
*  But there's a big misstep on LeBron. No, you can you tell me what it was about? [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7528.26s)]
*  I mean it was just like keep my son's name out your mouth type thing son [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7531.820000000001s)]
*  Your son is a professional athlete LeBron. I get I get what's that? I don't think it's about his son specifically playing [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7536.620000000001s)]
*  It was something that he compared Carmelo [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7542.5s)]
*  And his relationship with the son till Braun oh [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7545.18s)]
*  and it was like it was sort of like a weird little like sneak test from what I understand and [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7548.42s)]
*  So he wasn't insulting the way he played the game. He was insulting like his role as a father [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7553.18s)]
*  Yeah, it seems more like that to be honest from what I understand like I was reading up on a [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7558.3s)]
*  Bunch of people that were like sort of pinning it and like time the time code of what he was saying [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7562.7s)]
*  Yeah, but he said a bunch about Ronnie. So it's like I'm pretty sure he's just tired of him constantly bringing up his son [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7566.78s)]
*  Well, look, here's the reality. I just made it ten times. So like this this is one of the quotes [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7573.5s)]
*  He said I'm pleading with LeBron James as a father stop this and in regards to Bronnie's play time in the NBA [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7577.46s)]
*  Right and the idea is the only reason Bronnie's there is because he is LeBron's son [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7582.82s)]
*  Yeah, which is a perfectly reasonable excuse now [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7587.1s)]
*  I will say there's g-league games where Bronnie seems to be going off. Yeah, so but when he plays at the elite level [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7589.9s)]
*  He doesn't have he doesn't have any numbers that reflect his ability to play in the end [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7596.5s)]
*  That's what I believe Stephen is saying where it's like he's not ready. Yeah [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7600.26s)]
*  And then the bronze coming out. I'm like, yo as a father stop talking about my kid. So this is a tricky thing. It's like [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7603.82s)]
*  Because your father's in this advantageous position. You're gonna be able to bestow certain [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7609.82s)]
*  Opportunities upon your kid and he even mentioned this before he's like what you know [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7617.86s)]
*  I see white people do this all the time. They get their kids jobs that they don't deserve [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7621.08s)]
*  So, you know, so I support you doing it [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7624.86s)]
*  But at the same time that doesn't mean it goes without criticism [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7626.9800000000005s)]
*  Just like it doesn't go without criticism when you see the nepo baby shit with white people with Jews with anybody, right? [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7629.5s)]
*  It's like we criticize the nepo babies. We like to see people who have earned things and deserve things [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7634.38s)]
*  Yeah, we just don't have like commentary for hedge funds. We should we should we should have a Stephen a fresh [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7639.38s)]
*  Oh, and every week they just go through all of them. They're like, yo this trade this person hired this guy that was fucked up [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7645.82s)]
*  They got money from this person. I'd be fire [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7651.06s)]
*  We should just have a watchdog that just goes off on all the financial issues [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7653.14s)]
*  So boring to look at all that financial sure see if they can make it awesome person makes it a monk before they get [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7656.62s)]
*  Also that anyway point is is like I guess you can't have it both ways like you can get your kid a job that maybe [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7662.0599999999995s)]
*  He doesn't deserve but you can't also say nobody's allowed to criticize him. And if he doesn't deserve it [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7667.26s)]
*  This is a merit-based business sports. You're gonna get extra criticism [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7673.5s)]
*  so I get it as a father like you want to ride for your kids a hundred percent understand that but [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7678.22s)]
*  It's not gonna stop it like LeBron can say whatever he wants [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7684.780000000001s)]
*  The only thing the only reason I would say don't do it is because it's just gonna put more gas on it [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7688.54s)]
*  That's what he did. Yeah [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7693.14s)]
*  Yeah, and this is like the second thing in the past week that I've heard LeBron saying about the media [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7694.3s)]
*  What do you say? Like he was talking about this thing with who was it? [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7698.58s)]
*  Anthony Edwards, I think where he was like or I forget Tatum where he was like [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7702.700000000001s)]
*  Why do you want to be the face of the league? [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7706.320000000001s)]
*  So you just get criticized all the time get criticized every day day and day out everything you do picked apart by the media [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7707.3s)]
*  So I it feels like at this point his career he's like I should be beyond this but I'm still getting nitpicked at every single [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7712.82s)]
*  turn, you know, it's interesting man is that uh, I [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7718.62s)]
*  Don't know if this same criticism would happen ten years ago [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7723.14s)]
*  LeBron has one probably year left [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7727.9s)]
*  He might do two or three he could play as long as like his body holds up in his body looks great [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7731.26s)]
*  But let's say he's got one or two years left [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7735.08s)]
*  When the median knows you have one or two years left you don't have the leverage [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7738.54s)]
*  That you had when you have the next decade to dominate the sport. Mm-hmm [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7743.219999999999s)]
*  The media is moving on and finding new stars [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7747.0199999999995s)]
*  They're not as reliant on you for the success of the league as they were in the past [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7749.259999999999s)]
*  Like it's in the media's best interest if you're a superstar for you to be a superstar [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7753.5599999999995s)]
*  Because the bigger you get the more attention these people in the media get I think it's probably one of the arguments for protecting [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7758.82s)]
*  They say they protected Jordan, right? [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7764.66s)]
*  It's just like yo, let can you just not post bad shit about the Golden Goose and let us and that's a difference though [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7766.82s)]
*  I feel like they've always talked shit about brah. Yeah. Yeah [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7773.219999999999s)]
*  It's very little but they've always done it throughout his career. Yeah, he wasn't clutching the beginning [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7777.34s)]
*  You're right. You're right in the finals [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7781.74s)]
*  Like he never got the Jordan treatment and maybe that's why he's disgruntled about yeah, but why do you think that is I? [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7783.82s)]
*  Think just too much competition in sports media and it's like oh wow, that's interesting [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7791.0599999999995s)]
*  It's like you need a take and there's 40 different shows and they're all gonna have a take [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7795.62s)]
*  And what's the most interesting take is saying that the one of the greatest of all time is actually not the greatest [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7799.54s)]
*  Yeah, that's what we do just with everything. So imagine if you're him. He's like, you know, I look at what I've done [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7803.44s)]
*  And that probably fuels you when you're like 28 [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7809.58s)]
*  Yeah, but when you're 41 you just and you've already done everything you've won all the records of the lead score [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7811.58s)]
*  Like you've done everything you're like finally this will shut them up. No, and then you're like fuck this [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7816.34s)]
*  Yeah [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7821.0599999999995s)]
*  Cuz your greatness isn't was shuts them up or not [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7821.3s)]
*  And I wonder if there's even a part of him that's like I've been subjected to this my entire life my entire personal life [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7823.18s)]
*  Picked apart. I can't live in privacy. I like my everything sucks. Now I'm putting my son through this [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7827.9400000000005s)]
*  So he's probably trying to squash it early like yo chill and that's not you could talk about me, but chill out on oh [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7833.1s)]
*  That's a good ass. Yeah [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7838.66s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder if he feels like a little bit of a sense of like, you know [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7839.860000000001s)]
*  I'm putting my son through this terrible bullshit. I put myself through and he's a great player [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7842.54s)]
*  But also like we're good like I did this cuz I'm I came from nothing in Akron, Ohio [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7846.74s)]
*  Yeah, my kid doesn't necessarily he really doesn't have to go through it [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7850.72s)]
*  Yeah, if he doesn't want to but like now he's gonna be subjected to it even more scrutinized [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7853.68s)]
*  Yeah, I was compared to Jordan and now my kid is gonna be compared to me and [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7857.56s)]
*  Like and he probably feels personally responsible because he knows his son doesn't belong [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7861.84s)]
*  In that spot and it's because he leverages something to get in that spot [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7866.52s)]
*  So now you're responsible for all that hate is good [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7869.900000000001s)]
*  I wonder if he's grappling with that thing where where it's like is this Ronnie's dream is he doing this to? [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7872.2s)]
*  Impress me have I [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7878.38s)]
*  Kind of like push this ambition on to him [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7880.9s)]
*  Like that's a tricky one and through no fault of his own like just by becoming this virtuoso at this thing [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7883.66s)]
*  Your kids are gonna want to em you see how much people admire your father [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7889.139999999999s)]
*  You want to do that thing that they admire your father for naturally [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7892.099999999999s)]
*  I want to be a common just with my dad told funny stories [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7895.18s)]
*  Yeah, like yeah, so imagine your dad's the greatest ever you're like, yeah, you want to take a you know part in that lineage [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7898.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, it's tough. It's tricky [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7903.58s)]
*  And I wonder I feel for LeBron I wonder if he justifies it like I feel for both brawn and brawny [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7905.78s)]
*  Oh sure [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7911.0599999999995s)]
*  But I wonder if wonder if LeBron justifies trying to squash the criticism by saying you don't talk about any other g-league player like [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7911.66s)]
*  This yeah, like he's like yo [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7919.66s)]
*  Just treat him like every other g-league player and don't cover him which you do [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7922.14s)]
*  So he goes he might think in his brain [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7926.34s)]
*  He might be you're just doing this to either get at me or because you know, it's clicks [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7928.86s)]
*  But it's not genuine or authentic because you don't talk about g-league players at all [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7933.14s)]
*  But he's got to reconcile the fact that they're not treating brawny as a g-league [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7937.1s)]
*  But he'll see like that. I bet I bet you in his mind. I [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7941.9800000000005s)]
*  Bet you LeBron is like no, but brawny should be in should be in the NBA and he should be in the g-league [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7946.02s)]
*  Like he's better than these other guys. I see him hoop with them [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7950.42s)]
*  Like he actually has guys on his team that I'm sure he's like brawny's better than him [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7952.8s)]
*  I don't even know why the fuck we got this bum on the team [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7956.820000000001s)]
*  Mm-hmm [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7958.62s)]
*  And also there's that bias of being a dad like everything you see in your kid is gonna be the best [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7959.1s)]
*  So I wonder if he genuinely believes that the criticism is unfounded and he's reacting in kind [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7962.7s)]
*  Mm-hmm [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7968.94s)]
*  And it probably is because the fact that he's balling in the g-league like it's probably a mental thing when he gets in [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7969.54s)]
*  Also, like when we saw him at the garden like he gets put in with 30 seconds left [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7975.7s)]
*  And obviously he's they're gonna try to get him some buckets [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7980.22s)]
*  But keep in mind they call it garbage time for a reason facts [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7983.94s)]
*  But think about it if you're playing D on the last 30 seconds of a blowout [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7987.18s)]
*  You're also the bum on the other team and you're like, I ain't letting this kid score [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7992.38s)]
*  So he's not going against garbage time defense [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=7997.34s)]
*  He's going up against some young whippersnapper who's like brawny is not scoring on me [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8000.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah, this guy everybody calls a bum is gonna score on me. Now. I'm gonna lose my 10-day contract. Fuck that [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8005.34s)]
*  I'm putting the clamps on this kid. Mm-hmm. So he [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8010.2s)]
*  He's probably going against weaker defense in the g-league just in terms of effort. Oh, yeah [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8012.78s)]
*  Yeah, cuz they're treating him just like another player probably there's probably a little ego [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8017.78s)]
*  I'm sure they're gonna compare to the league. It's like, yeah, but it's a level. Yeah, it's tricky man as a dad. I get it [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8021.02s)]
*  It's a dad. I get it. Hmm, but [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8028.3s)]
*  But as yeah, but that was like Zelinsky he should have did that in private [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8032.3s)]
*  Hmm, that's the misstep. Yeah, you know, you got Stephen a's number [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8037.540000000001s)]
*  You could have just had that same combo in private [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8041.660000000001s)]
*  Also, Stephen a told us like he's when somebody tells me in confidence something I maintain that confidence [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8043.9400000000005s)]
*  He's like that's how you build trust for the players. Remember he was on the pod saying that he's like [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8050.1s)]
*  There's a bunch of things that people told me in confidence [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8053.740000000001s)]
*  I don't let that go out there in the world if something happens publicly I'll address that. Yeah. Yep [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8055.54s)]
*  Yeah, that was like an emotional. Yeah [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8061.18s)]
*  Yeah, a little misstep right there on bronze part a little misstep. I wonder if he has told him in private. Ooh [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8064.700000000001s)]
*  I wonder if he's like hey, just just chill with all that. Yeah, and then didn't chill. Yeah, that's possible. It's possible [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8072.780000000001s)]
*  What you saying though? Look at Mark's text for some breaking news. Oh, what do we got? [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8079.139999999999s)]
*  Ukraine agrees to US led ceasefire plan if Russia accepts [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8084.42s)]
*  So so real quick just on this [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8088.139999999999s)]
*  this is [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8091.22s)]
*  this is something that I've [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8093.0199999999995s)]
*  I've been thinking about a little bit recently [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8096.099999999999s)]
*  I'm not talking about like the fringe groups like the fringe right or the fringe left, right? [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8098.94s)]
*  Talking about like the average just kind of like working American [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8103.139999999999s)]
*  I think that we agree on like almost everything [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8109.18s)]
*  And not in terms of like what is a better functioning government or that kind of stuff in terms of like [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8114.18s)]
*  human to human basis [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8120.9s)]
*  You know, like I don't want these people to suffer [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8122.98s)]
*  I want people to have an opportunity [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8125.099999999999s)]
*  Some people think that that opportunity is better when things are privately run something people think it's better when there's a little bit bigger [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8126.74s)]
*  Government can offer assistance but like on the human to human level that what they what we want for each other is very [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8132.139999999999s)]
*  Similar [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8137.66s)]
*  So our reaction to this administration and the past administration is really based on optimism or pessimism [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8139.860000000001s)]
*  so I [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8148.46s)]
*  Treat this administration with optimism like I see Trump's tariff stuff and all these other things and I'm like, okay [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8151.860000000001s)]
*  It's hard to litigate something geopolitically in the public eye [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8157.34s)]
*  but [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8161.62s)]
*  Maybe this is his version of getting a better rate by throwing these tariffs and they come back and they go, okay [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8163.14s)]
*  Don't give us a hundred percent. Just do ten percent and then we'll lower your tariffs that we impose on you like [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8169.860000000001s)]
*  Like and I wonder he's negotiating unfortunately has to negotiate in front of the world and he can't exactly tell America [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8175.5s)]
*  Yo, by the way, we were just I'm not really gonna do a hundred [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8181.700000000001s)]
*  We're just trying to get them down because once he does that he loses the leverage, right? [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8184.400000000001s)]
*  So I treat with a little bit more optimism [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8187.740000000001s)]
*  Whereas someone who doesn't like Trump but still just like a reasonable person he or she looks at it with pessimism [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8189.78s)]
*  They're like he's gonna tank the economy. He's gonna destroy this beacon, but it doesn't mean that we don't want the same thing [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8197.14s)]
*  We want an American America that flourishes and we just get caught up in the tribal rhetoric [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8203.32s)]
*  But I really think that's and then the same thing with like the Democrats [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8208.86s)]
*  There was a pessimism that we looked at the Biden administration with the people that were more sympathetic to what Trump was saying, right? [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8212.3s)]
*  We're like, yeah, I don't think America will be as good if that happens. I think that more people will [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8218.34s)]
*  Suffer or at least not be able to move out of this very difficult situation there in but in terms of what we want for each [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8224.619999999999s)]
*  Other I think it's very similar. Yeah, I think we just get caught up in this like it feels so black and white [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8230.14s)]
*  It's really not it's like yeah, we want things to be cheaper the Democrat people are Democrats [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8236.46s)]
*  Like I think that the Democrats have a way of doing that [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8241.74s)]
*  I think it's gonna be better for people and [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8244.02s)]
*  Republicans like yeah, I actually don't think that that's been working. Let's try something different [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8246.300000000001s)]
*  But the way that it's spoken about online is so good verse evil that I think we think that we're on opposing sides [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8250.5s)]
*  In terms of the end goal or really not. Hmm. It's just like for example Charlemagne is more pessimistic about [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8257.54s)]
*  What Trump's administration is doing? I'm more optimistic about it. I'm sure if the Democrats from power [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8264.74s)]
*  He would be optimistic about what they're doing and their strategies. I may be more pessimistic about it [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8270.460000000001s)]
*  We both want the same thing. Yeah, we want better trade deals. We want better things for America [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8274.460000000001s)]
*  Right. We we don't want some shit. That's fair. Fuck fair. Mm-hmm. We want to come out ahead [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8280.1s)]
*  Yeah, I want a better deal with Canada better deal with Mexico better dudes [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8284.38s)]
*  I want I want to win all that shit and it's kind of a I feel like where I sit is like a dumb position [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8287.54s)]
*  sometimes because like I feel so jaded by political discourse that I just am like [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8292.34s)]
*  Wait and see yeah, which I've said before but like it's kind of a cop-out fence-sitting answer [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8296.3s)]
*  But at the same time I'm like is the ceasefire good? Yeah, it's like alright, it's good [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8300.3s)]
*  Yeah, but then all of a sudden part of Ukraine gets absorbed and you're like is that good? [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8304.539999999999s)]
*  That doesn't seem good and then so the Union reorganized you're like is that like I don't you know [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8308.1s)]
*  I mean, it's like until it actually affects me on like a personal basis or like the American society at large [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8312.42s)]
*  Yeah, I kind of try to reserve judgment [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8317.02s)]
*  I'm like just wait and see and which these in a good position necessarily from like a broadcasting standpoint [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8319.06s)]
*  Yeah, I think if you want to know what they want to feel anyone opinion [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8324.3s)]
*  But I also think like sharing that sentiment is important because there's people that also feel that way [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8326.98s)]
*  There's a lot of people like that because this shit really is a Rorschach test, right? [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8330.66s)]
*  Like and I'm exposed to my bias. I see that there's a ceasefire deal, right? Mm-hmm [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8333.98s)]
*  So this is my bias right here [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8339.22s)]
*  I'm like, all right Trump pulled the money after that meeting and all of a sudden we got a ceasefire deal [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8340.98s)]
*  Mm-hmm, right now that might not have been how it has gone at all [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8345.98s)]
*  Some other shit might have happened with European support and then somebody else backdoored with Putin and had a conversation whatever [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8350.44s)]
*  But in my bias mind, I'm like see sometimes you got to play hardball and then it ends up working out [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8355.880000000001s)]
*  Let's see how these tariffs work out over here. It's a [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8360.0s)]
*  And which goes back to perception because I'm pretty sure Trump is going to frame it that way [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8363.24s)]
*  And then his base would be like see I told you so and then his opposition will be like this had nothing to do with [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8368.6s)]
*  You this was actually negotiated by Saudi Arabia and there's another deal or whatever the fuck. Mm-hmm [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8374.16s)]
*  But all the noise online is just like sports analysts everybody wants to be first to the tape and you need to have the more [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8379.679999999998s)]
*  Salacious outrageous take how you gonna get views? Yeah, they're like you almost wish that there's a way that you could be [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8386.599999999999s)]
*  like how far does the pendulum need to swing before the most salacious thing is [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8394.16s)]
*  The most trustworthy thing [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8400.8s)]
*  Like I feel like we in those times well [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8403.439999999999s)]
*  I don't know like every time I think we are and then like you could say wow conspiracy theories and [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8405.92s)]
*  It seems like all of Twitter's like yep. That's fact that that is a hundred percent [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8412.0s)]
*  Like I wonder when [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8416.24s)]
*  Conspiracies are just so mainstream that there's like this thirst for all right. Just tell me the boring truth [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8418.519999999999s)]
*  Oh, you mean swing it swings back. I thought you meant the okay, like I feel like right now [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8423.64s)]
*  We're like at the top of the swing where [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8427.84s)]
*  Conspiracies everything like I'm like I can't wait to her like some doctor comes on and goes alright [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8430.08s)]
*  We did all the tests. This is the boring truth about vaccines. This shit is boring, but this is what it is [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8435.44s)]
*  Yeah, but we like story and we like a good story [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8441.48s)]
*  Conspiracies are good stories. You're right. No, but I wonder like the [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8444.76s)]
*  societal value and conspiracy is like, you know some shit that nobody else knows but if it becomes so popular, right [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8450.32s)]
*  Hmm. The new conspiracy will be the truth that thwarts the conspiracy [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8456.84s)]
*  Everybody knows the conspiracy like I remember I first read that [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8463.4s)]
*  That Dan Brown book yeah Da Vinci code Da Vinci code [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8468.64s)]
*  Oh, and I remember just being at parties in college like yeah, but this painting actually [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8471.96s)]
*  It was just great it felt so cool to share that information. Oh, this is you at the fucking museum [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8479.32s)]
*  For this reason, yeah, so [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8487.199999999999s)]
*  But I wonder and then once that book became so popular [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8490.8s)]
*  regurgitating that information [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMUARSgY_M&t=8494.199999999999s)]
