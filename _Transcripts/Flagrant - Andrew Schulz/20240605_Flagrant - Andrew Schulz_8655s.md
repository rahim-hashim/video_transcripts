**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [June 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k)
*  A few years in, I got the phone call one day and he's like, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=0.0s)]
*  I don't know if we can keep doing this, man. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3.04s)]
*  You're upside down 40 million f***ing dollars. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4.84s)]
*  This is what I'm talking about. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6.88s)]
*  Speaking of Conor, is this marketing on Conor's behalf? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8.08s)]
*  I will tell you this. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=10.48s)]
*  Let me give a f*** what anybody says. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=11.44s)]
*  Ali, Conor, both leveled when it comes to mental warfare. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  A month and a half later, we own the UFC for 2 million dollars. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  It's worth what now? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=18.72s)]
*  12, 13 billion. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=19.52s)]
*  If I brought up f***ing Jake Paul, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=20.64s)]
*  pretty much everybody in the room and the other room [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  wants to see Jake Paul get knocked out. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=24.8s)]
*  Did you help set that up? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=26.48s)]
*  Because I know you're close with Tyson. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=27.44s)]
*  God no. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=28.64s)]
*  I want to go to Caesar Palace. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=29.12s)]
*  I'm in this f***ing war with them right now. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=30.32s)]
*  Since Jan won, I beat them for 16.5 million dollars. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=32.32s)]
*  I've been clipping them from anywhere from 800 to a million a night. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=35.36s)]
*  When I lose, I'll go guns a blazing and go through my whole credit line. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=38.8s)]
*  Which is 6 million. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=42.24s)]
*  You've lost 6? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=43.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=44.32s)]
*  So I'll lose 6 million. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=44.64s)]
*  Well, I'm still up in 10 million on them. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=46.08s)]
*  Holy s***. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  Where's my phone? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=48.88s)]
*  Can you guys hear me in the other room? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=49.84s)]
*  Bring me my phone if you can hear me. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=51.44s)]
*  What do you got? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=52.8s)]
*  I'm shutting something. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=54.0s)]
*  What's up everybody? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=57.2s)]
*  Welcome to Flaker. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=58.08s)]
*  Today we're here with the big man. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=58.72s)]
*  It's Daniel White in the building. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=60.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=61.76s)]
*  Daniel White is in the building. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  Finally. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=63.44s)]
*  Long overdue. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=64.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=65.12s)]
*  I did a lot of research obviously for this because I wanted to go in depth. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=65.36s)]
*  I came across something. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=69.92s)]
*  I don't know if this is true or not, but it's out there on the internet that you were... [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=70.96s)]
*  There was like a hit on you or something in Boston by Whitey Bulger. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=75.52s)]
*  Is this true? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=79.2s)]
*  It's not true. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=79.84s)]
*  That is not true. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=80.48s)]
*  So how does this story even get out there? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=81.28s)]
*  Oh brother. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=83.36s)]
*  Why are you... [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=84.34s)]
*  Sort of like that, but it wasn't Whitey Bulger and it wasn't whatever. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=85.54s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=88.26s)]
*  So back in the day in Boston, Whitey Bulger ran south. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=88.66s)]
*  Of course. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=92.34s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=92.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=93.14s)]
*  Legit. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=93.53999999999999s)]
*  I mean you've seen the movies. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=93.94s)]
*  You've seen all the s***. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=94.9s)]
*  And you know, it was like living in south Boston at that time was like another f***ing... [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=97.14s)]
*  Like these guys didn't know what century it was, man. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=103.86s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=105.94s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=106.98s)]
*  And there were rules in that town. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=107.38s)]
*  Like you didn't call the police and they later ended up finding out he was working with the FBI. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=108.98s)]
*  So people that did call the f***ing police, they would know that you f***ing did it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=113.78s)]
*  And he was working with the FBI against other mob guys and s*** like that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=119.30000000000001s)]
*  It's a fascinating story. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=123.22s)]
*  But when you live there, you didn't do that s***. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=124.42s)]
*  One of his guys said that I owed him money. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=128.34s)]
*  Did you owe money? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=132.26s)]
*  No, I didn't owe money. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=133.06s)]
*  I didn't even know him. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=133.86s)]
*  Never nothing. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=136.5s)]
*  And it got to the point where I got a phone call one day at the house that I lived in. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=137.38s)]
*  Basically said, you got till Sunday to f***ing pay us. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=143.85999999999999s)]
*  Sunday at 1 or whatever the number was. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=146.01999999999998s)]
*  And I said, or what? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=148.1s)]
*  And they're like, are you going to find out? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=149.78s)]
*  So I literally hung up the phone, picked it back up and called Delta. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=152.1s)]
*  And that was a wrap. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=158.34s)]
*  And what's crazy about it is when you look at how everything played out in my life, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=159.46s)]
*  including the purchase of the UFC, had that not happened, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=164.9s)]
*  I wouldn't have been in Vegas at the time that all this was going on. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=170.66000000000003s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=173.38000000000002s)]
*  When you look back on your life, and I'm sure everybody on this f***ing couch [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=174.58s)]
*  and everybody watching can do it, you say, holy s***, this happened, that happened, this happened. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=177.94000000000003s)]
*  And at that time, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=183.22000000000003s)]
*  What if it was really Fertitta? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=184.5s)]
*  If you don't move to Vegas, you f***ing pay. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=187.86s)]
*  Well, that's crazy too, because when I got out there, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=190.74s)]
*  I was on the grind when I was in my 20s. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=196.34s)]
*  Like, I quit drinking when I was 21. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=199.05999999999997s)]
*  I stopped drinking and I only focused on work and what I wanted to do. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=200.98s)]
*  Same. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=205.78s)]
*  You quit drinking at 21. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=206.73999999999998s)]
*  That shows you what I was doing. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=211.61999999999998s)]
*  But we had the fake IDs and all that s***. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=214.33999999999997s)]
*  I'd already done all that s***. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=216.98s)]
*  He'd been drinking for 19 years. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=217.94s)]
*  It was good. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=218.82s)]
*  I got it out of my system before I was 21. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=219.22s)]
*  So I had this blanket policy. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=222.01999999999998s)]
*  When you get into your 20s, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=225.14s)]
*  everybody starts getting f***ing married. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=227.38s)]
*  I didn't go to anybody's wedding. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=229.85999999999999s)]
*  Blanket policy. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=231.38s)]
*  You were getting married, love you, I'll send you a gift, I'm not going anywhere. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=232.74s)]
*  Why? Why would you refuse to go to the most important day of their life? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=235.29999999999998s)]
*  Because it's f***ing time consuming, man. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=238.66s)]
*  F***ing weekend, somebody's getting f***ing married. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=242.57999999999998s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=246.26s)]
*  I'm happy for you, but I'm not going. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=247.54s)]
*  You would have hated my wedding. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=252.26s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=257.62s)]
*  Then you got these people to do the destination wedding. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=258.18s)]
*  I'm out. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=261.54s)]
*  There's this kid named Adam Corrigan that I grew up with in Vegas. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=264.42s)]
*  He had money, I didn't have money, and he was always a good dude. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=268.98s)]
*  He would pick me up and drive me to school every day. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=272.65999999999997s)]
*  When you think about in high school, to get up and get me and drive me to work, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=276.98s)]
*  this dude had to wake up an hour earlier every day to drive me to school. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=282.5s)]
*  Never forgot that. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=285.54s)]
*  People who do things for me like that, I never forget. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=286.58s)]
*  He was getting married, so there was no f***ing way. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=289.3s)]
*  I wasn't going to go to his wedding. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=292.5s)]
*  I go to his wedding, and who do I run into? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=294.74s)]
*  The Fertitta brothers. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=297.78s)]
*  I haven't seen in f***ing years, Lorenzo Fertitta comes up to me and says, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=300.09999999999997s)]
*  hey, how you been? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=304.5s)]
*  And this and that good. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=305.38s)]
*  We hadn't seen each other since high school. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=306.97999999999996s)]
*  You guys went to high school together. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=308.26s)]
*  That's another thing a lot of people don't even f***ing realize. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=309.7s)]
*  You guys knew each other originally. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=312.5s)]
*  From high school. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=314.34s)]
*  So then I don't talk to him. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=315.86s)]
*  And it's like me and Lorenzo knew each other in high school, but we weren't friends. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=317.7s)]
*  It's not like we hung out and did whatever. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=321.06s)]
*  We knew each other. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=323.22s)]
*  So he says to me at the wedding, I hear you're doing this boxing thing. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=324.66s)]
*  I just got on the athletic commission. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=328.18s)]
*  I would love to come train with you. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=330.02s)]
*  I said, let's do it on Monday. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=332.02s)]
*  He came and trained with me on Monday and we've been together ever since. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=333.94s)]
*  Get the f*** out of here. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=337.54s)]
*  So the one f***ing wedding that I go to. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=338.66s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=341.46s)]
*  Imagine where you'd be if you went to all the weddings. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=342.18s)]
*  You'd be the president of the United States. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=344.26s)]
*  And the president of the United States. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=346.26s)]
*  Rule of the world. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=348.26s)]
*  He'd be Jeff Bezos. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=349.3s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=350.34000000000003s)]
*  For all of our sakes, you didn't go to any other wedding. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=351.54s)]
*  We have a chance. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=354.58s)]
*  So you guys like a... [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=357.3s)]
*  And you're training him in boxing. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=358.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=361.22s)]
*  Because you were training people. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=361.54s)]
*  You were running boxing gyms as well. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=362.98s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=364.42s)]
*  So there was a gym. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=364.82s)]
*  When I first came back to Vegas, there was a gym called United Champions. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=366.34000000000003s)]
*  And it was me, this guy named Nick One Kick. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=371.06s)]
*  Who was a Muay Thai trainer and Roger Mayweather. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=374.58s)]
*  You guys have to f*** out of here. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=377.54s)]
*  Hold up. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=380.42s)]
*  So you've known the Mayweathers for decades. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=381.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=383.94s)]
*  30 plus years. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=384.26s)]
*  And was Roger as wild back in the day? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=384.74s)]
*  Roger was a f***ing maniac. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=386.82s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=388.58s)]
*  So people, just to put this in perspective, Roger trained Floyd. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=388.74s)]
*  Because Floyd and his dad, they had some sort of... [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=391.94s)]
*  His dad was in jail. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=394.66s)]
*  Oh. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=395.54s)]
*  So his dad was in jail. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=396.02s)]
*  So while he was in jail, his uncles, you know, Roger and Jeff took care of Floyd. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=397.86s)]
*  Jeff was much younger though, wasn't he? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=404.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=405.86s)]
*  Jeff was younger than Roger. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=406.34000000000003s)]
*  So those guys, you know, sort of took Floyd under the wing and helped Floyd out. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=408.34000000000003s)]
*  While his dad was in jail. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=413.62s)]
*  So that's how me and Floyd became close and got to know each other early on. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=416.42s)]
*  And yeah, so it was me, Roger and Nick One Kick that worked out of United Champions. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=421.46000000000004s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=425.86s)]
*  Sorry, can I ask you about your first time meeting Floyd? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=426.42s)]
*  What's your impressions of him? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=428.1s)]
*  What do you think of him? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=428.90000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I liked Floyd. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=429.78000000000003s)]
*  Floyd came out of the Olympics and was a charismatic, good-looking kid, talented. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=430.98s)]
*  And yeah, I like Floyd. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=438.5s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=439.86s)]
*  It's funny, when I first... [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=440.26s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=441.62s)]
*  No, no, I didn't want to fast forward, but the Floyd-Conner fight now... [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=442.02000000000004s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=446.1s)]
*  ...is an even crazier event. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=447.54s)]
*  But we can get to that later. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=449.46000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=450.34000000000003s)]
*  Sorry to interrupt. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=450.58000000000004s)]
*  No, Floyd and I have known each other for a long time. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=451.22s)]
*  And when I first met Floyd, he lived in an apartment that top rank used to put a lot of their fighters in. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=453.54s)]
*  He lived in this apartment down on... [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=460.1s)]
*  I want to say it was off Flamingo. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=462.26000000000005s)]
*  And he just started to make some money. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=464.18s)]
*  So I went over to his house, he was showing me all the sweaters that he bought and all the things. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=466.90000000000003s)]
*  Floyd's always been that guy. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=471.62s)]
*  He likes to shop and he likes to buy clothes. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=474.42s)]
*  And it started the minute he made his first dollar. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=476.5s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=478.98s)]
*  Okay, so you're in this gym. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=479.94s)]
*  I imagine tons of characters and everything rolling through the gym. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=481.54s)]
*  What is your period of ingratiating yourself to these guys? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=484.02000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=487.86s)]
*  Are you a little nervous around them? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=488.1s)]
*  We had a real weird fucking dynamic there because I was training like businessmen and housewives and shit like that. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=489.22s)]
*  And then you got Roger Mayweather. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=496.34000000000003s)]
*  I mean, there were fights would break out in this gym. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=499.70000000000005s)]
*  And I'll never forget. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=506.1s)]
*  So there was this heavyweight and his name was Tracy. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=508.82000000000005s)]
*  And him and fucking Roger Mayweather got into it one day in there. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=512.5s)]
*  And Roger had fucking jeans on and a shirt, takes fucking shirt off and like we're fucking fighting. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=516.34s)]
*  So they get up into the ring and they put gloves on and Tracy and Roger Mayweather start fucking fighting. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=525.3000000000001s)]
*  Tracy's a heavyweight, he's a pro. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=530.1s)]
*  Roger fought at what, 147? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=531.7s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=533.22s)]
*  Roger's fucking this big. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=533.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=535.7s)]
*  And they're fucking banging. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=536.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=538.26s)]
*  Banging in there, right. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=539.0600000000001s)]
*  So the bell rings and Tracy stops punching and Roger fucking punches him. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=541.0600000000001s)]
*  And he's like, I'm gonna go and blast him and says, no rounds, motherfucker. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=545.7s)]
*  And they just keep fucking going. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=549.3000000000001s)]
*  And then what eventually happens is the heavyweight gases out and Roger's fucking just beats the fucking shit out of them to the point where everybody had to jump in the ring and fucking break it up. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=550.82s)]
*  And stop it. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=561.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=562.0200000000001s)]
*  That was the kind of shit that went on there on a daily basis. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=562.5s)]
*  And then you had Nick one kick the Muay Thai guys fucking crew that was in there. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=566.98s)]
*  That crazy shit would happen. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=573.5400000000001s)]
*  It was just, it's fucking nuts. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=574.98s)]
*  The whole fight world, the real fight world is a crazy fucking business. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=576.66s)]
*  And why were you drawn to this? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=582.58s)]
*  I've always liked it since I was a kid. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=584.26s)]
*  But do you like, did you like chaos and shit? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=586.34s)]
*  Like, I love, I love everything about fighting, man. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=588.1800000000001s)]
*  And it's not just, I was a huge boxing fan, obviously, but boxing, martial arts, you know, fucking the fight after school at the park. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=591.14s)]
*  I mean, all that type of, all that fucking. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=599.14s)]
*  Because you were getting kicked out of school. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=601.0600000000001s)]
*  I didn't miss one fucking fight that happened after school at the park. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=601.62s)]
*  Were you involved? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=605.0600000000001s)]
*  Were you? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=606.26s)]
*  Some, but mostly watched. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=606.74s)]
*  I watched a lot of fights. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=608.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=610.58s)]
*  I like fights, man. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=611.38s)]
*  I just always have. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=612.26s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=613.46s)]
*  It's what I love. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=613.7s)]
*  I mean, look how long I've been doing this and I still love it. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=614.34s)]
*  I can't wait for this weekend. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=616.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=618.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=619.14s)]
*  There's a, there's, yeah, there's a, well, we'll get, we'll get to that. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=619.3s)]
*  There's a really cool story about you that I think that has been confirmed, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=624.1s)]
*  but it was told by a mutual friend. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=628.02s)]
*  And it was about when Rogan was going through one of his like many cancellations. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=630.1s)]
*  And, you know, maybe some people at the network were like, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=634.1800000000001s)]
*  I think we got to set this guy aside. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=637.62s)]
*  And, and what I heard was that you said, if he goes, I go. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=639.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=644.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=645.38s)]
*  I never talked to, so Lex Friedman, I did his podcast and apparently he was there when [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=645.62s)]
*  this all went down, but this has never been talked about or brought up or whatever. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=650.1800000000001s)]
*  And would have never been talked about if Lex Friedman didn't bring it up. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=654.1800000000001s)]
*  But yeah. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=657.06s)]
*  When Rogan was going through his thing, you know, it was at the peak of this cancel [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=658.02s)]
*  culture shit going on. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=665.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=666.3399999999999s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, fuck that shit. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=667.2199999999999s)]
*  First of all, it's easy to look at things, you know, like when you look at Rogan and, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=669.38s)]
*  and Rogan makes shit loads of money. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=675.14s)]
*  He's got the biggest podcast in the world and all this shit. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=678.66s)]
*  But back in the day, so when we bought the UFC, the UFC was based in New York. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=681.54s)]
*  So the offices were here. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=687.2199999999999s)]
*  Even though it was illegal to put on the roof. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=689.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=691.2199999999999s)]
*  But their offices were here. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=691.6999999999999s)]
*  Bob Meyerwitz, the owner is from New York and the offices were here in New York. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=692.8199999999999s)]
*  So after we bought the company, I jumped on a plane and I flew out here and I had to go [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=697.38s)]
*  through the office and figure out what I was going to bring to Vegas and what I was going [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=702.3399999999999s)]
*  to leave. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=706.0999999999999s)]
*  What was worth it? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=706.42s)]
*  Well, they had a room that was just full of fucking tapes. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=707.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=711.4599999999999s)]
*  So I had to go through each fucking tape and watch every tape, just make sure it wasn't [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=711.9399999999999s)]
*  something important. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=716.02s)]
*  So I pop in this tape and it's the Keenan and Ivory Wayans show. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=717.9399999999999s)]
*  He had his own talk show. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=721.38s)]
*  I remember that. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=722.34s)]
*  And they had fucking Joe Rogan on. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=723.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=724.66s)]
*  And Keenan and Ivory Wayans says to him, you're into this, this ultimate fighting stuff, huh? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=725.38s)]
*  And Rogan starts going fucking off on the UFC, Marie Smith and what he would do to all [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=730.5s)]
*  these action stars and all this stuff. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=738.9s)]
*  And this is the fucking fear factor guy. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=741.22s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=743.06s)]
*  And the way that Joe talked and how passionate he was, I go, this is the fucking guy that [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=744.5s)]
*  I need. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=749.38s)]
*  This is the fucking guy. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=750.5s)]
*  It just hit me. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=752.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=753.78s)]
*  So I reached out to Rogan and we start going back and forth. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=755.3s)]
*  And I said, I would love you to come in and be one of the commentators. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=759.14s)]
*  And Rogan's attitude was, so wait a minute. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=763.46s)]
*  So you're saying I can come over there, sit in the best seats in the house and watch the [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=766.98s)]
*  sport that I love for fucking free. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=770.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=773.0600000000001s)]
*  I'm in. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=773.38s)]
*  So at the time, financially, we were getting fucking murdered. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=774.42s)]
*  Rogan did the first 12 or 13 shows for free. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=778.34s)]
*  For free. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=782.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=782.74s)]
*  And he's stoked. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=783.22s)]
*  And killed it. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=785.54s)]
*  And the thing that I loved about Joe Rogan was when you were sitting there and watching [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=786.58s)]
*  Joe Rogan on TV and he was on the mic, he wasn't one of these HBO fucking goofball, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=790.66s)]
*  talking fucking heads that were being paid. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=796.82s)]
*  You felt that this dude not only knew what he was talking about, but loved what this is about. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=799.38s)]
*  And that began the relationship with me and Joe Rogan that now has been coming up on 20 something [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=806.0200000000001s)]
*  years. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=813.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=813.86s)]
*  And you think that you're going to fucking cancel Joe Rogan and you're going to, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=814.1s)]
*  and I'm going to just say, okay, no, I will fucking quit this job and leave and go do [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=817.86s)]
*  something else before you're going to try to fucking. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=824.34s)]
*  I loved it. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=827.3800000000001s)]
*  And the whole cancel thing, I just literally just talked about this a couple of days ago [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=827.94s)]
*  with, if you're in the right place in your life and who the fuck's going to cancel you? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=832.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=837.7800000000001s)]
*  The only people that, the only ones that can really cancel you are your fucking family [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=838.4200000000001s)]
*  and your friends. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=843.1400000000001s)]
*  Fuck all these other people. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=844.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=845.7800000000001s)]
*  Strangers you never see in your life. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=846.1800000000001s)]
*  Who gives a shit what any of these fucking people think. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=847.62s)]
*  Dude, it's so funny how serendipitous your life is. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=850.34s)]
*  You get kicked out of Boston. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=853.14s)]
*  Luckily you go to a wedding randomly and meet the guy. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=855.06s)]
*  You're looking at tapes. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=859.78s)]
*  Did you look through every single tape or? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=860.9s)]
*  I went through every fucking tape in that, in that building. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=862.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=865.22s)]
*  Because you have to clear out a hoarders supply closet. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=865.54s)]
*  Well, you have to make sure you're not throwing away something that's actually valuable. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=869.06s)]
*  That in the future, you know what I mean? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=871.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=874.42s)]
*  But I had to make, I had to determine what we were going to keep and what we weren't going [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=874.74s)]
*  to keep. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=877.86s)]
*  Did you get anything else out of those tapes or I mean, it's all worth it if you got Joe, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=878.02s)]
*  but I mean, if you look at what. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=880.74s)]
*  What became of Joe Rogan and how important he is to the sport. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=883.3s)]
*  Yeah, huge. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=887.38s)]
*  Without a doubt the most valuable tape that I watched that day. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=887.94s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=891.46s)]
*  You're okay. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=891.86s)]
*  You were saying the business was losing money like crazy. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=892.9s)]
*  Do you have a sit down with the Fertitta brothers and go, okay, let's buy this. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=896.1s)]
*  This can be something. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=900.1s)]
*  Why do you even feel it can be something like take me through this lot. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=901.54s)]
*  I'll tell you a crazy story. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=906.34s)]
*  So at the time I was managing guys, right? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=907.3s)]
*  Boxers and MMA fighters. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=909.62s)]
*  What boxers you have? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=911.94s)]
*  I had any guys that would know. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=912.98s)]
*  And how did that happen? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=915.0600000000001s)]
*  It's fucking crazy. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=917.22s)]
*  Somebody else just asked me this question too. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=918.1800000000001s)]
*  How it happened. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=919.94s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=920.9000000000001s)]
*  I always had this thing where, I don't know, people would come to me and ask me to help them. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=922.1s)]
*  You should see my office now. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=929.7s)]
*  Like every day, a majority of my day is taking meetings with people that are building businesses [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=931.3800000000001s)]
*  and want to ask if I will be a part of them. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=936.98s)]
*  It's like fucking shark tank at my office. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=938.9000000000001s)]
*  I'm literally in there and people are pitching me their business ideas. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=941.6999999999999s)]
*  And oddly enough, before I had ever really done anything, I owned gyms and was in the [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=944.98s)]
*  training business. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=950.9s)]
*  People have always come to me and asked me to help them do something. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=951.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=956.02s)]
*  So it happened in the fight world. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=956.66s)]
*  I had these gyms and I was training people and fighters would come to me. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=958.9s)]
*  Fuck Derek, what's your last name, Derek? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=964.8199999999999s)]
*  I got Derek a fight with Roy Jones Jr. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=967.14s)]
*  I did the deal for that fight. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=970.74s)]
*  Derek, Derek Harmon. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=972.74s)]
*  I got Derek Harmon the fight with Roy Jones. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=975.14s)]
*  I negotiated that deal and did all that. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=976.74s)]
*  On HBO? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=979.0600000000001s)]
*  Before we bought the UFC. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=979.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=980.98s)]
*  That was the biggest thing I had ever done before we bought the UFC. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=981.7s)]
*  Now, this is Roy's heyday. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=985.86s)]
*  Are you telling your fighter, like go out there, give it your best shot? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=988.66s)]
*  No, this is a, you know, let's see how much money we can get for this fight. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=991.94s)]
*  Fucking Roy Jones. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=995.94s)]
*  Roy Jones is going to get all the money. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=996.74s)]
*  You're going to make a couple million bucks and get in there and try to fucking beat him. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=998.66s)]

*  Let's get back to the show. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1036.26s)]
*  So you start, you're managing some of these got these MMA guys. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1037.3799999999999s)]
*  Do you feel MMA's popularity rising or do you see this like white space where you're like, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1039.94s)]
*  okay, I can turn this into something? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1044.74s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think that we saw the popularity rising. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1046.18s)]
*  What we saw was first of all, we started taking jujitsu, me and the Fertitta brothers. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1048.82s)]
*  We took jujitsu. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1053.62s)]
*  We fucking fell in love with jujitsu. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1054.4199999999998s)]
*  Frank, actually the oldest brother. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1056.7399999999998s)]
*  We were out one night at the Hard Rock and we saw John Lewis, who was the only guy in [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1059.54s)]
*  Vegas at the time that had a jujitsu studio. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1064.1s)]
*  And Frank's like, that's that ultimate fighter guy. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1066.9799999999998s)]
*  I said, I know him. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1069.3s)]
*  And he's like, I've always wanted to learn ground fighting. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1070.34s)]
*  I said, let's go talk to him. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1074.1s)]
*  We talked to him. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1075.06s)]
*  We set up a meeting session on Monday and me, Frank and Lorenzo all went [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1076.1s)]
*  and became addicted. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1083.38s)]
*  We started training four or five days a week, trying to rip each other's fucking heads off [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1084.18s)]
*  and arms off. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1088.2600000000002s)]
*  And sorry, did you just know him because the fight world is that small? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1088.9s)]
*  Yeah, I knew him just from being in the fight world in Vegas. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1091.7s)]
*  And through John Lewis, he started bringing in BJ Penn, fucking Chuck. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1094.8200000000002s)]
*  We started to meet all these guys and we started training with them and we became obsessed. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1103.46s)]
*  And then we went to a UFC event and me and Lorenzo were literally sitting in the crowd [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1109.38s)]
*  going, imagine if they fucking did this and imagine if they did that. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1114.82s)]
*  This thing could be big. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1118.26s)]
*  I mean, they didn't sell merchandise. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1119.3s)]
*  They didn't have programs. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1120.66s)]
*  They didn't fucking do anything. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1121.7s)]
*  They didn't really care about the live event. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1123.3s)]
*  They just focused on the pay-per-view, the television side. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1125.86s)]
*  And we just saw a lot of opportunities. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1128.98s)]
*  The other thing that we saw was the boxing guys all had the same story. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1130.66s)]
*  We came from the mean streets of such and such. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1135.3s)]
*  And if it wasn't for boxing, we'd be dead or in jail. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1137.6999999999998s)]
*  That was like every guy's story. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1140.1s)]
*  You meet these guys. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1142.34s)]
*  I mean, if you... [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1143.3s)]
*  I'm a science teacher from Nebraska. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1143.9399999999998s)]
*  All were from different places that all had different stories. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1148.1s)]
*  And the thing that I loved is if you were involved in martial arts growing up, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1152.34s)]
*  you came for money. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1158.1s)]
*  Because it was expensive to put your kids in martial arts. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1159.78s)]
*  Or you graduated college because you wrestled. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1162.58s)]
*  So we had... [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1166.34s)]
*  If you look at Chuck Liddell at the time, right? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1167.86s)]
*  If you thought about what the stereotypical ultimate fighter looked like, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1170.34s)]
*  it was Chuck Liddell. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1173.78s)]
*  The Mohawk, the Chinese writing on the head, the goatee. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1175.3s)]
*  He looked like a fucking ax murderer, right? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1178.42s)]
*  The guy graduated with honors from Cal Poly with an accounting degree. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1181.1399999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1185.94s)]
*  I mean, you didn't have any of those stories in boxing. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1186.34s)]
*  So one of the things that we really loved were the stories. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1190.5s)]
*  That there were different storylines for these guys [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1192.74s)]
*  that would appeal to different groups of people. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1194.9s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1197.46s)]
*  Okay, so you guys make the offer. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1198.9s)]
*  What's the offer? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1200.9s)]
*  How do you even approach them? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1201.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1203.0600000000002s)]
*  So here's what happened. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1203.6200000000001s)]
*  So I was representing Tito Ortiz at the time, right? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1204.9s)]
*  And Tito... [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1208.26s)]
*  Your boy. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1208.8200000000002s)]
*  My boy. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1209.6200000000001s)]
*  Tito had got fucked over by them because he showed up to a fight [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1210.5s)]
*  and he was supposed to be paid a certain amount of money. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1214.26s)]
*  Well, the fight didn't do well. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1217.3000000000002s)]
*  So right before the fight goes off, they went back and told him, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1218.98s)]
*  yeah, we're not paying you what we told you we were going to pay you. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1222.02s)]
*  We're going to pay you this instead. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1224.34s)]
*  And he's like, well, then I won't fucking fight. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1226.1s)]
*  And they said, then don't fight. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1228.82s)]
*  Doesn't matter. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1230.1s)]
*  We don't care. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1230.6599999999999s)]
*  We're not going to make any money on this event anyway. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1231.86s)]
*  So they're hammering money. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1233.4599999999998s)]
*  So Tito had to fight. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1234.5s)]
*  So he fought. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1236.1799999999998s)]
*  So I'm going in negotiating his new contract [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1236.98s)]
*  and I'm trying to get them to pay him the money [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1240.4199999999998s)]
*  that they fucked him on on that fight. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1242.98s)]
*  Right? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1245.1399999999999s)]
*  So finally, the owner blows up on me and says, you know what? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1245.9399999999998s)]
*  There is no more fucking money. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1250.1s)]
*  I don't even know if I can put on the next event. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1252.18s)]
*  I literally hung up the phone, picked it back up, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1255.94s)]
*  called the Fertitta brothers and said, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1258.42s)]
*  I think the fucking UFC is in trouble. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1260.5s)]
*  I think they're going to go under. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1262.5s)]
*  And I think we could buy the company and I think we should. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1264.02s)]
*  So Lorenzo fucking reached out to Bob Meyerowitz [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1267.3s)]
*  and, you know, a month and a half later, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1271.54s)]
*  we own the UFC for $2 million. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1274.66s)]
*  Now, I don't want to hold it. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1276.02s)]
*  Hold it. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1277.38s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1278.9s)]
*  So you buy it for $2 million. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1279.0600000000002s)]
*  It's worth what now? [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1280.02s)]
*  Now? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1281.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1282.1000000000001s)]
*  $12-13 billion. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1282.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1286.18s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1287.7s)]
*  It sounds great now, but we went through a lot of shit to get here. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1288.18s)]
*  That's what I want to hear. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1291.14s)]
*  How long was the UFC around before that day? [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1292.66s)]
*  Like before you bought it? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1295.38s)]
*  Well, now we bought it back in 2001. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1296.42s)]
*  So we've owned it for 23, 25 years, whatever the fuck it is. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1299.0600000000002s)]
*  It's been around 30 years. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1304.02s)]
*  So starting in 94. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1305.46s)]
*  Question. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1306.98s)]
*  I don't want to count your pockets, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1307.46s)]
*  but $2 million back then seems like a lot of money. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1308.58s)]
*  You guys own some gyms, whatever. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1310.82s)]
*  How do you get that money together? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1312.26s)]
*  What's that process like? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1313.86s)]
*  You're taking out loans. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1315.3s)]
*  Well, now he just said, what a great return on your money. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1316.1799999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1319.06s)]
*  At the time when we bought it for $2 million, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1319.6999999999998s)]
*  we were literally the fucking redheaded stepchild of the Fritida portfolio. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1321.86s)]
*  Like every, you know, smart fucking, you know, numbers fucking geek [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1326.1s)]
*  that worked for the Fritidas hated this investment, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1331.46s)]
*  thought it was ridiculous and that the Fritidas were going to lose all their money. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1334.98s)]
*  Every fucking one of them. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1338.5s)]
*  There's a lot of people that run around now claiming, oh, the UFC, I believe that. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1340.74s)]
*  Nobody fucking. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1344.74s)]
*  There were three guys that believed in it. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1345.54s)]
*  Me, Frank and Lorenzo. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1347.3000000000002s)]
*  That was fucking it. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1348.42s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1349.54s)]
*  And basically what we had to do was start to think about this too. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1350.26s)]
*  When we bought it, none of us had ever fucking done production. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1355.22s)]
*  We'd never put on a fucking show in our lives. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1359.22s)]
*  Okay. So are you outsourcing? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1362.3400000000001s)]
*  Are you reaching out to boxing guys? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1363.78s)]
*  No, here's what we knew. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1365.46s)]
*  We were huge fans. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1367.14s)]
*  We were fight nerds. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1368.74s)]
*  We knew what we wanted. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1369.7s)]
*  You know, now it was just a matter of building it. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1371.38s)]
*  And the problem is number one, when you want to do what we did, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1374.8200000000002s)]
*  and number two, when you want to do what we did [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1379.6200000000001s)]
*  and you don't know what the fuck you're doing, it's expensive. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1381.5400000000002s)]
*  Right? So every time you put on a show, it's a couple million bucks. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1384.42s)]
*  So are you losing immediately? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1388.9s)]
*  A few years in, you know, you're upside down, 40 million fucking dollars. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1390.9s)]
*  This is what. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1395.7s)]
*  Wow. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1396.18s)]
*  Because I think the perception of the UFC is immediate success. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1396.98s)]
*  You guys buy it, Chuck Liddell, Tito, they start banging away. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1400.98s)]
*  Then this Conor McGregor guy comes around and everybody's a billionaire since then. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1404.02s)]
*  I want to know the most you're down 40 million at one point. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1407.7s)]
*  So we're probably by 2004, we're upside down 40 million dollars. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1413.06s)]
*  And we're only doing five events a year. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1417.14s)]
*  And explain to me what that means. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1419.14s)]
*  That's like you're losing money on the shows you're putting on. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1420.58s)]
*  You're losing money on what the deals you're doing. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1423.14s)]
*  So we're losing money on the shows. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1425.38s)]
*  We're losing money on overhead, you know, the expenses for the office and employees. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1428.5800000000002s)]
*  And every way that you could possibly lose money in a business, we're fucking losing money. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1433.6200000000001s)]
*  What keeps you going at this point mentally? [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1436.74s)]
*  Because 40 million is. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1438.74s)]
*  I know you got a lot of willpower. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1439.8600000000001s)]
*  But 40 million is 40 million. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1441.46s)]
*  Understand this too. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1443.0600000000002s)]
*  Think about this. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1444.3400000000001s)]
*  So when we bought the UFC, right? [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1445.0600000000002s)]
*  We basically bought those three letters and an old wooden octagon. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1448.74s)]
*  And we had like 13, 14 fucking contracts. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1452.5800000000002s)]
*  That's it, right? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1455.3000000000002s)]
*  The old owner had sold away the home video rights, the video game rights, and all that shit. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1456.42s)]
*  Lionsgate Entertainment owned all that shit. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1462.26s)]
*  Probably one of the fucking craziest stories that's never been told is [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1465.22s)]
*  you want to talk about people not believing in the fucking UFC [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1468.8200000000002s)]
*  and thinking that this thing was not going to work. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1472.9s)]
*  We went to Lionsgate, right? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1475.7800000000002s)]
*  To negotiate, to buy the rights back to all of our fucking intellectual property. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1478.74s)]
*  Everything from t-shirts to video games to action figures. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1484.98s)]
*  Everything that you can throw a fucking UFC logo on. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1488.98s)]
*  Now, if you're Lionsgate, why the fuck would you sell that? [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1491.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1496.02s)]
*  Right? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1496.66s)]
*  The bigger you make the business, the more money they make. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1496.98s)]
*  100%, right? [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1498.74s)]
*  That's how much people didn't fucking believe. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1500.5s)]
*  We went in and negotiated the rights. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1503.22s)]
*  And when we walked out of that fucking office, they were probably like, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1505.62s)]
*  these poor fucking jerk-offs are going to pay us, you know, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1508.26s)]
*  $3 million over the next fucking four years for these rights back. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1511.6999999999998s)]
*  And you know, you got some, again, a numbers guy who doesn't fucking believe in anything. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1515.86s)]
*  Leo, not just that, but he's like, if you look at our books over the next three years, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1522.82s)]
*  we're going to add these numbers. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1526.82s)]
*  Imagine if Lionsgate wouldn't sell us those rights back. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1528.26s)]
*  How much fucking money they'd be making right now off, you know what I mean? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1531.4599999999998s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1536.7399999999998s)]
*  So you're down 40. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1538.02s)]
*  Tell me the moment. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1539.6999999999998s)]
*  Oh, and by the way, when we bought these rights back, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1540.98s)]
*  that's when the DVD business went like this. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1544.34s)]
*  So we're putting out these fucking DVDs. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1547.22s)]
*  That's when I remember people watching it originally. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1548.9s)]
*  It wasn't pay-per-view. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1551.3s)]
*  The first fucking checks we started to get were from DVDs. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1552.5s)]
*  You know, when the DVD business took off, you know, we were getting [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1556.58s)]
*  $2 million fucking checks off of DVDs. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1559.46s)]
*  Is that helping float you? [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1562.02s)]
*  Like, I'm still curious. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1563.22s)]
*  No, it didn't help float. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1564.1s)]
*  It was the only revenue coming in at the time. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1566.58s)]
*  Just so I can understand, and the people at home can understand, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1570.18s)]
*  you put on an event, you would create a DVD of the event, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1572.4199999999998s)]
*  and then you would sell these DVDs [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1575.3s)]
*  so that people that couldn't watch it on pay-per-view or whatever. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1576.58s)]
*  100%. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1578.58s)]
*  Got it. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1579.54s)]
*  And then we started doing compilation shows. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1580.34s)]
*  Best Knockouts, Best Missions, you know, all that kind of stuff. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1582.82s)]
*  And that shit sold really well. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1586.1s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1588.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1588.74s)]
*  Now, yeah, I'm still trying because as a comic, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1589.3s)]
*  there's a period where you don't think you're going to make it. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1591.86s)]
*  I'm broke. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1593.7s)]
*  I'm not 40 million in debt. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1594.4199999999998s)]
*  What is your mentality as you are upside down 40 million? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1596.42s)]
*  What are you thinking? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1600.02s)]
*  What's your emotional state? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1600.74s)]
*  What's your, I think you were with your wife at the time. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1601.94s)]
*  What's that? [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1603.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I was always just on the fucking grind. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1604.18s)]
*  I go into work every day and I keep my head down. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1606.42s)]
*  You don't even fucking going forward. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1608.8200000000002s)]
*  I mean, if you look at what we've done, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1610.26s)]
*  I get to work at 8.30, 9 o'clock in the morning every day, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1611.94s)]
*  and I leave the office at 8 o'clock, 8.30 every fucking night. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1615.0600000000002s)]
*  So that's always been my drive, my focus, my mentality, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1618.1000000000001s)]
*  whatever the fuck you want to call it. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1623.3000000000002s)]
*  But I got the phone call one day from Lorenzo. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1624.98s)]
*  And he's like, I don't know if we can keep doing this, man. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1628.34s)]
*  This is fucking, you know, get out there and- [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1631.38s)]
*  What year is this? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1634.82s)]
*  What year is this? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1635.46s)]
*  2000, 2004. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1636.34s)]
*  So 2003 you buy? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1639.7s)]
*  One. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1642.02s)]
*  So one you buy, 2004 you get the phone call. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1642.34s)]
*  Okay, how does the phone call go? [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1644.98s)]
*  2004 and- [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1645.78s)]
*  You need to leave Vegas. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1647.38s)]
*  Get out there. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1648.26s)]
*  There's less debt over there. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1648.82s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1652.58s)]
*  Two grand. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1653.22s)]
*  Whitey, I need to come back. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1654.18s)]
*  Now I see how Whitey billable. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1658.42s)]
*  So yeah, get out there and see what you could sell this thing for. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1661.78s)]
*  So I start making calls. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1666.9s)]
*  And I call him back at the end of the day and I'm like, six or seven million. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1669.22s)]
*  He's like, okay. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1675.22s)]
*  Did you lie? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1676.66s)]
*  Did you get like a $70 million offer? [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1677.46s)]
*  Six, seven is what I felt we could sell it for. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1679.06s)]
*  And he says, all right, I'll talk to you tomorrow. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1682.98s)]
*  So he hangs up the phone and I'm like, this is a fucking rap. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1687.0600000000002s)]
*  This is fucking, it's over. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1689.6200000000001s)]
*  The next morning I'm driving to work and he calls me and says, fuck it. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1691.54s)]
*  Let's keep going. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1696.66s)]
*  Wow. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1697.38s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1698.1000000000001s)]
*  So we start working really hard on trying to figure out how to get on fucking television. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1698.8200000000002s)]
*  Because we think that that's the key to success. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1706.18s)]
*  We believe that if we get on free television, more people will see this, love it like we do, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1708.66s)]
*  and it'll work. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1715.22s)]
*  And is that Spike? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1716.26s)]
*  So well, then Spike TV. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1717.5400000000002s)]
*  Don't let me jump ahead. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1720.74s)]
*  If there was another moment. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1721.6200000000001s)]
*  No, no, you're dead on. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1722.5800000000002s)]
*  So what happens is, I want to say it was the Nashville network or whatever it was before [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1724.26s)]
*  it was Spike. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1728.98s)]
*  They switch it to the men's network, Spike TV. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1729.5400000000002s)]
*  And we're like, if this isn't a fucking slam dunk for us, right? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1732.98s)]
*  What's more of a men's show than fucking UFC? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1736.58s)]
*  So we go and pitch the guys on it. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1740.58s)]
*  Spike hates it. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1742.1s)]
*  They don't like it. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1743.86s)]
*  And we remember that day, we talk about it all the time. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1745.54s)]
*  These guys were, it was in LA and they were going to the fucking Dodgers game that day. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1747.9399999999998s)]
*  And they could not get out of this fucking meeting fast enough to go see the Dodgers play. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1751.6999999999998s)]
*  And we called them back a few days later and said, because it was going to cost $10 million [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1756.1799999999998s)]
*  to produce the show, The Ultimate Fighter. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1763.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1764.74s)]
*  Because reality shows were hot at the time. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1765.38s)]
*  So we came up with this concept for the reality show and that's what we pitched them on. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1767.22s)]
*  So we called them back three days later and said, well, what if we put up the 10 million [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1771.0600000000002s)]
*  ourselves? [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1774.18s)]
*  They like that idea better. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1775.22s)]
*  So I'll tell you what else is incredible. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1776.42s)]
*  So because again, nobody believed. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1778.9s)]
*  You retain everything. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1782.5s)]
*  So we put up the money. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1783.7s)]
*  We retain 100% of all the rights. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1786.1000000000001s)]
*  So we own everything, lock, stock and fucking barrel. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1789.8600000000001s)]
*  Do you remember what their reservations were at the time? [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1792.5800000000002s)]
*  Great question. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1795.14s)]
*  It's just nobody, nobody fucking believed in this thing and nobody thought it was going [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1795.94s)]
*  to be fucking big. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1799.46s)]
*  And, you know, it's sort of become my thing. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1800.3400000000001s)]
*  It's what I fucking love to do. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1803.38s)]
*  It's the same thing with PowerSlap. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1805.14s)]
*  This thing got shit on. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1806.74s)]
*  This thing's been around for 15 months. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1808.18s)]
*  It's a $750 million business. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1810.5s)]
*  Fucking rushes it. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1813.8600000000001s)]
*  We have all the. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1815.94s)]
*  I knew it was going to come up. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1818.5800000000002s)]
*  So I said that you brought it up. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1819.7s)]
*  I didn't bring it up. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1821.0600000000002s)]
*  I literally just got off a fucking call. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1821.78s)]
*  With with one of the networks talking about it. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1824.66s)]
*  But yes, it fucking a pretty good network. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1826.8200000000002s)]
*  Absolutely fucking dominates social media. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1829.6200000000001s)]
*  So here's the thing about this is that it's impossible when you know someone's going to [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1833.3000000000002s)]
*  get slapped to not watch. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1836.74s)]
*  It's literally like if you're on scrolling on social media and I come across the clip, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1838.5800000000002s)]
*  it's impossible. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1842.5s)]
*  I see a giant Samoan guy and a black dude looking at him and just biting down on something. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1844.26s)]
*  I'm going to fucking watch. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1849.0600000000002s)]
*  That's what happened to me when I started looking at this stuff in like 2018. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1850.18s)]
*  It was on Instagram and this stuff was coming out of Russia and Poland. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1853.86s)]
*  And I was like, what the fuck is this? [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1857.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1859.4599999999998s)]
*  So I take a deeper dive into it and looks like it was filmed on a flip phone in a barn somewhere. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1859.9399999999998s)]
*  They're literally slapping over a barrel and it's got 350 million views on YouTube. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1865.86s)]
*  And at the time that was like a fucking Justin Bieber video. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1869.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1872.9799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1873.4599999999998s)]
*  I was like, what? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1873.6999999999998s)]
*  What if I did this? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1874.8999999999999s)]
*  Made it an actual sport, got it sanctioned and put good production value behind it. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1876.82s)]
*  The answer is fucking billions of views, billions of views globally. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1882.02s)]
*  And it destroys. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1887.54s)]
*  Think about this. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1888.42s)]
*  We started this thing 15 months ago. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1889.06s)]
*  And right now on YouTube, we have more subscribers than NHL, MLS, NASCAR, PGA, Barstool Sports. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1892.26s)]
*  We have over a billion YouTube views. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1900.42s)]
*  Eight of the top 12 largest YouTube shorts against other major sports are power slaps. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1903.3s)]
*  And four of the top five largest YouTube shorts on UFC channel. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1908.9s)]
*  We're number one, two, three, and four on UFC. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1912.98s)]
*  And when you think about Conor McGregor, Rhonda Rousey, Brock Lesnar, all the big stars, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1916.26s)]
*  this thing absolutely dominates. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1921.14s)]
*  We have more followers than every single professional sport. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1924.3400000000001s)]
*  Every professional sports team, we have more followers than them in 15 months. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1928.8200000000002s)]
*  More than Real Madrid or these soccer teams? [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1935.22s)]
*  I don't know about the soccer teams, but I would say yes. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1939.06s)]
*  Every fucking sports team, we have more followers. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1943.62s)]
*  Soccer's the best. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1945.86s)]
*  So I would say yes. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1946.5s)]
*  Did you acquire the IP or did you just create your own? [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1948.4199999999998s)]
*  No, we created our own. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1950.8999999999999s)]
*  There were a couple of fucking leagues out of Poland and Russia. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1953.1399999999999s)]
*  So I just started our own. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1957.46s)]
*  And why didn't you do that with UFC originally? [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1959.06s)]
*  Why would you purchase those three letters and the wooden octagon? [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1960.74s)]
*  The UFC fell on my lap. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1963.94s)]
*  I was in the middle of that call and we could buy the thing for $2 million. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1966.9s)]
*  Why would you not buy the UFC? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1970.5s)]
*  We probably wouldn't have gone out and started our own league, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1973.54s)]
*  but the thing fell on my lap. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1976.74s)]
*  We can get to Power Slap in a little bit. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1980.18s)]
*  I just want to go through the UFC. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1981.6200000000001s)]
*  Back to the shit. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1983.46s)]
*  But the similarities between what's going on with that right now. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1984.66s)]
*  This is why you believe in it so much. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1987.3s)]
*  When people go... [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1989.38s)]
*  So I want you guys to wrap your fucking brains around this. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1990.18s)]
*  When I talk about Power Slap, you're all dismissive. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1994.42s)]
*  Like, uh... [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1997.22s)]
*  Nobody's dismissive. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=1998.98s)]
*  But I love that when you are. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2000.02s)]
*  The UFC was fucking worse. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2000.5800000000002s)]
*  I need that. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2002.02s)]
*  I need that. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2002.66s)]
*  The UFC was worse. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2003.22s)]
*  Worse. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2006.02s)]
*  Now I know how to motivate you to do anything. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2006.66s)]
*  I'm just going to tell you it's not going to work. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2008.8200000000002s)]
*  Hey Dana, this thing's... [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2010.3400000000001s)]
*  That's what I love. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2011.0600000000002s)]
*  I know. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2011.8600000000001s)]
*  I know. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2013.0600000000002s)]
*  This happens every day. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2014.1000000000001s)]
*  When I bring Power Slap, we're on the phone today with the network. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2015.46s)]
*  Dana, you won't go to Turkey and get hair. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2018.66s)]
*  This is the same. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2020.42s)]
*  You won't do it. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2021.14s)]
*  You won't get a hair transplant at Turkey, Dana, no matter what. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2022.02s)]
*  I promise you. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2024.9s)]
*  You won't make this the biggest podcast episode ever. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2025.6200000000001s)]
*  I love it. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2027.3s)]
*  You won't make this the number one episode ever. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2028.02s)]
*  I love it. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2030.1000000000001s)]
*  Okay, you love being told no. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2030.98s)]
*  You love being told it's not going to happen. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2032.66s)]
*  No, you know, it's easy... [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2033.8600000000001s)]
*  When I hit you with fucking numbers, you can't... [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2037.46s)]
*  There's no... [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2039.8600000000001s)]
*  You can't refute it. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2040.26s)]
*  We have more views than any Taylor Swift video ever posted. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2040.98s)]
*  Now you're talking about the Swifties, bro. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2044.98s)]
*  Power Slap has more... [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2046.6599999999999s)]
*  Swifties stepped up. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2048.34s)]
*  We have more views than any fucking Taylor Swift. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2049.06s)]
*  Imagine you got Taylor in one. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2051.22s)]
*  There's other stats that I can hit you with that are just... [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2052.8199999999997s)]
*  You got to get Taylor to do a Power Slap, dude. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2055.86s)]
*  But they're unbelievable. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2058.2599999999998s)]
*  But when you look at this thing from a business perspective and you look at the numbers... [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2059.62s)]
*  But we're talking about guys fucking slapping each other. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2065.46s)]
*  You guys are like, let's talk more about the UFC. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2067.62s)]
*  The UFC was worse. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2070.42s)]
*  When we would walk into a room, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2072.1s)]
*  nobody wanted to hear the fucking UFC. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2073.46s)]
*  The UFC is fucking gross. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2075.54s)]
*  You don't fucking hit somebody and jump on top of them and start beating them. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2077.3s)]
*  It's disgusting. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2080.98s)]
*  It's fucking... [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2082.18s)]
*  This, that, and everything else. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2083.2200000000003s)]
*  The same thing they're saying at that Power Slap. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2084.1s)]
*  100%. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2085.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2085.94s)]
*  And I remember the early days of UFC. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2086.34s)]
*  My dad is like lifelong boxing fan. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2088.34s)]
*  Used to go to Ali's camp in the Poconos, interview all the guys. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2090.7400000000002s)]
*  Like he used to work for NBC and lifelong boxing fan. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2094.7400000000002s)]
*  He saw some UFC early and he said this. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2100.58s)]
*  I know this makes no sense, but it's too violent for me. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2102.98s)]
*  And this is like, saw Sugar Ray Robinson driving around New York City when he was a kid. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2106.42s)]
*  He loves boxing, but it seemed too violent for him. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2111.8599999999997s)]
*  100%. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2115.22s)]
*  So I think... [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2115.7799999999997s)]
*  Think about this. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2116.58s)]
*  On average, 10 to 12 boxers die a year, right? [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2117.46s)]
*  In boxing, 30 years. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2120.66s)]
*  Never a death or serious injury in the UFC. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2124.98s)]
*  And this is what I tried to explain to you. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2128.2599999999998s)]
*  I'm sure you know all these stats, but this idea... [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2129.7s)]
*  People didn't realize that the gloves, which we thought protected the boxers, [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2131.62s)]
*  actually can cause more than that. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2136.5s)]
*  100% and all the sparring elite, but more importantly... [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2138.3399999999997s)]
*  It is the sparring elite. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2140.9s)]
*  A lot of people... [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2141.62s)]
*  I don't think a lot of give enough... [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2142.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's like the old sparring wars that they used to do. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2144.9s)]
*  Like I'll talk to some of the guys. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2148.2599999999998s)]
*  I was talking to Max Holloway and he's like, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2149.38s)]
*  yeah, I don't really spar that much anymore. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2150.8199999999997s)]
*  And like a lot of guys have limited it. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2152.3399999999997s)]
*  And maybe they just have incredible timing and they can get away with it. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2154.2599999999998s)]
*  Where certain guys, they just need to get in there and they need to get the work in. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2157.22s)]
*  But that will take years off your fucking life. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2161.22s)]
*  100%. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2163.14s)]
*  Yeah, the micro concussions, right? [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2163.7s)]
*  And the other fucking thing that they never do in boxing is... [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2165.38s)]
*  Every time you put on a boxing event, it's a going out of business sale. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2168.58s)]
*  They're trying to grab as much money as they possibly can. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2171.62s)]
*  You don't reinvest in the sport. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2174.18s)]
*  But one of the big expenses for us that we spend shitloads of money on is health and safety. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2175.54s)]
*  So if you take these guys and you put them through the proper medical testing before they fight, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2180.66s)]
*  you have the proper testing there. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2185.94s)]
*  And then so many times when we watch a crazy fight, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2187.46s)]
*  we're like, send them straight to the fucking hospital. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2191.54s)]
*  No fucking PR, no nothing. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2194.98s)]
*  As long as you spend the money medically, you make it as safe as you possibly can. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2196.82s)]
*  Okay, what is the turn? [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2202.34s)]
*  Spike TV cuts off. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2203.7s)]
*  So yeah, we're at Spike TV, bought the rights for 10 million. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2204.5s)]
*  So Spike TV, we put up the 10 million bucks and we launched the Ultimate Fighter. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2206.66s)]
*  The Ultimate Fighter fucking ticks off. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2210.34s)]
*  Immediately? [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2212.42s)]
*  Yeah, immediately. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2213.06s)]
*  By episode five, we're pulling such massive fucking numbers. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2214.18s)]
*  So again, you know, sort of the, I don't know, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2219.8599999999997s)]
*  this is the way that shit has always worked out with me. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2224.58s)]
*  But the things that runaway fucking hit. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2227.94s)]
*  Now, when you have runaway hits on networks, you're on fucking billboards, buses, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2230.8999999999996s)]
*  they're doing ads and all. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2235.7s)]
*  The fucking president of the company gets fired halfway through the fucking season. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2237.06s)]
*  So every fucking thing we thought was going to happen or whatever, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2244.02s)]
*  plus we're a time buy. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2247.7s)]
*  We bought our way onto the fucking thing. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2249.7s)]
*  We're getting nothing. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2251.14s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2252.98s)]
*  So you're the biggest show on the network, no promo from the network. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2253.54s)]
*  The new guy comes in, you like him. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2256.74s)]
*  We're the biggest new show on the network because the WWE was on there at the time. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2259.14s)]
*  Fair enough. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2262.5s)]
*  So we're the biggest fucking hit they've ever had that's homegrown on Spike TV. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2263.22s)]
*  Got it. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2268.18s)]
*  Right? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2268.42s)]
*  All their other shit flops, right? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2269.7799999999997s)]
*  We're fucking homegrown, home run. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2271.94s)]
*  Okay, before... [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2273.7000000000003s)]
*  We're getting zero love. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2274.98s)]
*  Okay, before you talk about this, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2276.26s)]
*  this is the first time you've had positive reception for this thing [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2278.02s)]
*  that everybody says is not going to work. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2280.82s)]
*  100%. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2282.42s)]
*  Do you call people and you go, fuck you? [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2282.9s)]
*  No, not yet. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2284.98s)]
*  Take us there. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2288.26s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2288.98s)]
*  So we're sweating it, the whole fucking season, right up to the finale. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2290.82s)]
*  You know, we have no new deal. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2296.34s)]
*  These guys have fucking promised us nothing. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2297.78s)]
*  We have nothing. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2300.1s)]
*  We go into the finale. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2301.78s)]
*  The finale starts out Diego Sanchez runs through Kenny Florian like it was nothing. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2303.06s)]
*  All the fights have been fucking... [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2308.5800000000004s)]
*  Then Forrest and Stefan Bonner come out in the main event and just start going toe to toe, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2312.5800000000004s)]
*  knock down, drag them out. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2319.54s)]
*  The fucking people are stomping their feet in the arena. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2321.2200000000003s)]
*  It sounds like a train's going through the fucking place. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2323.54s)]
*  It goes right to the fucking decision. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2326.1000000000004s)]
*  You know, they read off the scorecards, Forrest Griffin fucking narrow, inches it out, wins the fight. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2329.2200000000003s)]
*  I give them both a fucking contract. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2335.86s)]
*  Place is going crazy. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2338.26s)]
*  Oh, by the way, the crowd is chanting one more round, one more round, all this shit. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2339.3s)]
*  And during that, you know, it was like three to four minutes of that fight. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2345.3s)]
*  So this is before computers. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2350.82s)]
*  This is before social media, all that shit. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2352.1800000000003s)]
*  People are picking up their phones, calling their friends, going, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2354.82s)]
*  are you watching this fucking fight right now in Spike TV? [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2356.74s)]
*  Wow. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2358.66s)]
*  It has a live... [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2359.22s)]
*  Oh, it's spiked during the fight. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2360.5s)]
*  During the fight. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2362.2599999999998s)]
*  Oh, because it's Nielsen ratings. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2363.06s)]
*  You can time when the spikes are. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2364.74s)]
*  Oh shit. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2367.3799999999997s)]
*  We had more people watching than the masters on CBS at like three minutes during that fight. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2368.8999999999996s)]
*  So literally, we don't know all that that night. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2376.1s)]
*  We just know something special just fucking happened here. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2378.3399999999997s)]
*  I didn't give a fuck. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2382.3399999999997s)]
*  If we resign the deal with Spike or whatever, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2383.9399999999996s)]
*  I knew we had it. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2386.9s)]
*  The spike executives literally pull us out in the alley at the arena [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2389.14s)]
*  because we're at the small little Cox Pavilion. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2392.98s)]
*  It's called the Cox Pavilion. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2394.98s)]
*  And we go out in the alley. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2396.1800000000003s)]
*  We do our television deal on a fucking napkin in the alley. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2397.94s)]
*  No way. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2402.02s)]
*  For our new Spike TV. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2402.5s)]
*  Do you know what you're asking for immediately going in or... [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2403.14s)]
*  No, it's just sort of all played out in the alley out there. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2405.94s)]
*  So you did the short form right there. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2408.42s)]
*  We're signing on. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2409.78s)]
*  It's going to happen. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2410.42s)]
*  We'll deal with the money. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2410.98s)]
*  This is like a handshake fucking... [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2411.62s)]
*  So they're shaking in their fucking boots. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2413.2200000000003s)]
*  They see the Nielsen. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2415.06s)]
*  They see the ratings probably spike. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2416.02s)]
*  Everybody's going fucking crazy. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2418.26s)]
*  Well, this is right after the fight. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2419.46s)]
*  Taping. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2420.98s)]
*  This is literally that night. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2421.46s)]
*  Yeah, but what I'm saying is... [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2422.82s)]
*  That night, we go right out into the alley and fucking... [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2423.62s)]
*  No, he's saying when it came along, when it got broadcast two months later. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2426.18s)]
*  Oh, so you wouldn't get away later. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2429.38s)]
*  Yeah, you weren't getting Nielsen ratings back for fucking... [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2430.7400000000002s)]
*  This was on a Saturday. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2433.46s)]
*  You weren't getting the real numbers till Wednesday. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2434.7400000000002s)]
*  So they just felt it. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2436.34s)]
*  They're like, this is going to be... [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2437.22s)]
*  If you were in that fucking building that night, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2438.18s)]
*  you knew something special just happened. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2440.66s)]
*  Wow. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2442.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2442.9s)]
*  Did you talk to Forrest after? [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2443.14s)]
*  That was crazy. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2445.1400000000003s)]
*  Like, what was that... [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2445.86s)]
*  I think... [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2447.6200000000003s)]
*  That was a wild ride for everybody because if you look at how that thing blew up, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2449.1400000000003s)]
*  Forrest Griffin obviously became a huge pay-per-view star. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2453.3s)]
*  Nobody knew who the fuck he was going into season one. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2456.26s)]
*  And now he's our biggest pay-per-view star. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2458.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2460.34s)]
*  And he's still working with you guys. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2460.82s)]
*  And you've got Chuck and Tito and all these other guys, right? [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2461.78s)]
*  And obviously, that season, the coaches were Chuck and Randy. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2464.42s)]
*  So that was fucking huge. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2469.38s)]
*  They became big. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2471.06s)]
*  And yeah, that was it. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2472.7400000000002s)]
*  It just from that fucking night on. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2474.98s)]
*  And pay-per-views start after that? [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2477.2200000000003s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2478.9s)]
*  And the first... [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2479.62s)]
*  So that's the moment you get out... [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2481.3s)]
*  You get into the... [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2483.86s)]
*  What is it? [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2484.58s)]
*  The black. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2484.98s)]
*  Well, no. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2485.94s)]
*  You dig out of the red. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2486.42s)]
*  So the first... [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2488.1s)]
*  No, we just knew something special happened that night and that we had something. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2488.66s)]
*  Sorry, where is this? [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2492.26s)]
*  So then this is 2005. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2493.2200000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2494.9s)]
*  So then it was probably in 2006 or 2007. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2495.54s)]
*  I can't remember which it was. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2500.9s)]
*  2006 or 2007. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2502.02s)]
*  We're in a fucking budget meeting. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2503.38s)]
*  And let me tell you what you didn't want to be in. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2504.58s)]
*  We're budget meetings the first five years of fucking USA. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2505.94s)]
*  So we're in this budget meeting and Lorenzo is up writing on this whiteboard. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2509.06s)]
*  And I'm looking at it and I'm like, wait a minute. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2513.78s)]
*  Does that say I'm going to make a million dollars this year? [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2516.82s)]
*  No. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2518.7400000000002s)]
*  He's like, yeah. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2520.26s)]
*  So six or seven, we started to climb out of the fucking hole. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2521.54s)]
*  Out of the $40 million fucking... [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2525.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2526.98s)]
*  You start making money. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2527.62s)]
*  There's got to be another plateau that you hit. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2529.06s)]
*  Is it with talent? [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2531.86s)]
*  Is it with change in a deal? [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2533.46s)]
*  Is it like a specific guy? [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2535.38s)]
*  Well, what starts to happen then is you start to... [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2537.3s)]
*  It becomes a real business. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2540.98s)]
*  Now you start figuring out how to run this. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2542.34s)]
*  We're doing things in the combat sports world that have never been done. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2544.9s)]
*  Everything we're doing has never been done. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2548.9s)]
*  Think about boxing, right? [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2551.14s)]
*  Tell me if there's ever been a business in the history of the world [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2552.98s)]
*  that has made trillions. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2555.94s)]
*  Trillions of dollars. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2558.58s)]
*  And at the end of the day, there's nothing left. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2560.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2562.34s)]
*  There's nothing there. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2563.06s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2563.78s)]
*  That's what you mean by going out of business sale. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2564.1s)]
*  Right? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2566.18s)]
*  There's not like a league. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2566.74s)]
*  Right? [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2568.74s)]
*  You have different promoters that are negotiating with each other. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2568.82s)]
*  Sometimes they're keeping their fighters from fighting each other. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2571.06s)]
*  How often growing up was there an Aram fighter that wouldn't want to fight against... [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2573.62s)]
*  Who was it? [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2577.94s)]
*  Golden Boy that Bob would always be with? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2578.34s)]
*  Well, you couldn't get Riddick Bowe and Lennox Lewis to fight each other. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2579.86s)]
*  He'd all throw the fucking... [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2584.74s)]
*  The belt's in the trash. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2586.42s)]
*  Fucking this and that and all this other shit. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2587.94s)]
*  It took fucking Saudi Arabia to make these fights that are going on now. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2589.54s)]
*  Because you've got guys that don't give a shit what it costs. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2594.98s)]
*  They're like, fuck it. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2597.7s)]
*  You've got this guy, you know, shake turkey that's like, [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2599.14s)]
*  I want to see this fight. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2601.46s)]
*  I'm going to make it happen no matter what the fuck it costs. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2603.14s)]
*  And they don't care if they make money. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2605.7s)]
*  There's never been a scenario like that. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2609.2200000000003s)]
*  I mean, the pinnacle of boxing was HBO. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2610.7400000000002s)]
*  And HBO would throw some of this money around to make the big fights happen. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2614.58s)]
*  But even HBO got to a point where you'd have guys who were house fighters, right? [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2617.3s)]
*  Whether it's Roy Jones or whatever. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2622.6600000000003s)]
*  And they're just fighting guys. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2624.42s)]
*  Roy fighting. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2626.26s)]
*  None of the big fights were really happening then either. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2626.82s)]
*  It took fucking Saudi Arabia to make it happen. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2629.3s)]
*  We built a business where every fucking weekend [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2633.0600000000004s)]
*  you see the fights that you want to see. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2636.42s)]
*  Because you're invested in both fighters that are fighting. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2637.86s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2640.1000000000004s)]
*  I think that's a big difference. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2641.0600000000004s)]
*  We're invested in everything. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2642.26s)]
*  Yeah, you didn't see that in boxing. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2643.38s)]
*  Everybody fucking wins. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2644.98s)]
*  At the end of the day, two fighters come in and somebody's going to win and somebody's going to lose. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2646.18s)]
*  But if you lose, it doesn't mean you're dead. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2650.2599999999998s)]
*  It's the end of your fucking career. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2653.7s)]
*  Boxing got to a point where if you lost the fight, it's over. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2655.06s)]
*  And then what I noticed was, this is what I started to look at. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2659.7s)]
*  HBO had a guy that they signed. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2663.7s)]
*  And he could lose fucking three fights in a row. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2667.8599999999997s)]
*  And he'd still sign a massive fucking deal. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2671.14s)]
*  Ricardo Mayorga. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2673.46s)]
*  No. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2674.5s)]
*  Are we talking about a good? [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2675.38s)]
*  Arturo Gatti. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2676.9s)]
*  Oh, Arturo, of course. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2677.86s)]
*  There's been a few of those, but go on. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2680.1000000000004s)]
*  Arturo Gatti would fucking lose, but he'd sign another big deal with HBO. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2682.1000000000004s)]
*  You know why? [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2685.54s)]
*  Because people didn't give a fuck whether he lost. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2686.34s)]
*  They loved how he fought. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2688.34s)]
*  Those Mickey Ward fights. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2689.3s)]
*  100%. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2690.34s)]
*  Arturo Gatti got to fight Floyd Mayweather. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2691.1400000000003s)]
*  He should not, with all the respect, he was in peace. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2694.42s)]
*  But he should not have been fighting Floyd. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2696.5800000000004s)]
*  And we watched it. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2699.1400000000003s)]
*  He was a blood and guts fucking guy that people loved. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2700.1000000000004s)]
*  And I said, you can build a business around guys like this. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2702.58s)]
*  Guys that go in and give it all they fucking got. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2706.42s)]
*  Win, lose, or fucking draw. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2709.22s)]
*  People want to see good fights. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2710.66s)]
*  Because you know what people are fucking tired of? [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2711.7799999999997s)]
*  Seeing multimillionaires run around in circles and not fight [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2713.7799999999997s)]
*  so that they can move on to the next big fucking payday [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2717.2999999999997s)]
*  that they didn't earn or deserve. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2720.02s)]
*  OK. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2721.54s)]
*  One thing I noticed about UFC that I think separates it. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2722.34s)]
*  There is a reward structure. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2725.7799999999997s)]
*  I think Chell put this the best, actually. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2728.1s)]
*  You don't tell fighters what not to say. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2730.74s)]
*  Because when you tell people what not to say, [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2735.14s)]
*  you are telling them what to say. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2737.8599999999997s)]
*  And you don't believe in telling them what to say. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2739.9399999999996s)]
*  In fact. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2741.7799999999997s)]
*  And I don't believe in controlling other fucking human beings. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2742.4199999999996s)]
*  Here's the thing I think UFC does really well. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2746.4199999999996s)]
*  And I want to know if this is a conscious effort. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2748.3399999999997s)]
*  There is a reward system that's built into UFC [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2750.58s)]
*  that oftentimes induces the most exciting product. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2753.7799999999997s)]
*  So you could look at it at the most simple level, [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2758.18s)]
*  which is like, hey, there's a best fight bonus. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2760.18s)]
*  Both of you guys get it. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2762.74s)]
*  You were involved in the best fight. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2764.1s)]
*  You both get it. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2765.3799999999997s)]
*  So it makes people show up and go, I'm going for it today. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2766.1s)]
*  Now, is this how do we make it more interesting? [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2769.06s)]
*  Let's bonus it out. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2772.1s)]
*  Do you come into this going trying to fix this problem in boxing? [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2773.54s)]
*  I'm saying, when is this problem solving stuff? [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2777.62s)]
*  Let me tell you this. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2779.54s)]
*  If you know that you're going to go in [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2783.54s)]
*  and you're going to make 30 million dollars, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2786.1s)]
*  all right, guaranteed, in the bank, 30 million. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2788.8999999999996s)]
*  All you got to do is win. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2791.94s)]
*  And maybe you can get 35 million for the next fight. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2793.62s)]
*  I'm on the bicycle. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2796.66s)]
*  You don't have to be exactly. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2797.3799999999997s)]
*  You can fucking do everything you can to avoid a fight [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2798.5s)]
*  and just make it to that next fucking payday. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2802.18s)]
*  That's what ended up happening with boxing. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2804.18s)]
*  And what we did is we built incentive to go out and fucking perform. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2806.98s)]
*  And that's how you build a brand and that's how you build a sport. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2814.18s)]
*  And that's how you build. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2816.98s)]
*  I'll give you another perfect example that's fascinating is [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2818.02s)]
*  fighters are the most paranoid people in the world. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2822.9s)]
*  All of them completely paranoid. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2825.7s)]
*  We'll set up a fight and they're like, oh, he wants me to fucking lose. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2828.7400000000002s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2832.34s)]
*  He wants this guy to fucking win. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2833.3s)]
*  They have this type of paranoia. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2834.82s)]
*  And you saw it recently with Dustin Poirier. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2836.58s)]
*  So we made the Saint Denis fight, right? [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2840.18s)]
*  As soon as the fight goes out, all the people are going, [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2842.42s)]
*  oh, they don't like Poirier. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2844.58s)]
*  They're trying to get Poirier killed. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2845.7s)]
*  Poirier kind of freaked out a little bit. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2847.14s)]
*  Like, what the fuck? [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2849.2999999999997s)]
*  Then Poirier goes in there. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2849.8599999999997s)]
*  Dog. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2852.02s)]
*  And look what he fucking does. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2852.8999999999996s)]
*  Look what he does, right? [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2854.74s)]
*  He wins the fucking fight. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2856.58s)]
*  Nobody. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2859.46s)]
*  It's like sometimes we make a fight and fans or media will go, [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2859.8599999999997s)]
*  this is a shitty card. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2863.62s)]
*  It hasn't happened yet. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2866.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2867.3799999999997s)]
*  Who the fuck are you? [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2867.7s)]
*  What they say about 300. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2868.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2871.06s)]
*  Who the fuck are you to say this is a shitty card before it fucking happens? [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2872.66s)]
*  Listen, when the card's over, I'll be the first one to tell you the card fucking sucks, right? [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2876.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2881.06s)]
*  You can't judge anything until it happens. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2881.62s)]
*  And when you get in these positions, like it happened in boxing for years, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2883.22s)]
*  like Poirier thinking we wanted him to lose, he goes out and he fucking, you know, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2887.14s)]
*  this is legendary shit that takes you to another level and makes you great. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2894.8999999999996s)]
*  And where is he this fucking Saturday? [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2899.86s)]
*  Championship. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2901.38s)]
*  He's fighting for the fucking world title. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2902.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2903.54s)]
*  Okay. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2903.86s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2904.1s)]
*  Because he went out and took that fucking Saint Denis fight [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2904.9s)]
*  that everybody thought he couldn't win. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2908.1s)]
*  I feel like we've been manipulated or we're scorned from watching so much boxing. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2912.1s)]
*  Again, I'm a boxing guy, I came from boxing, I watch every single fight growing. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2918.5s)]
*  I'm obsessed with boxing. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2921.46s)]
*  Me too. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2922.9s)]
*  And I'm watching fights and I'm like, okay, this is a tune up or this is a tomato can [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2924.42s)]
*  or this is whatever. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2928.42s)]
*  If it was boxing, if it was boxing, my mentality would be like, oh, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2929.46s)]
*  they're saying that Poirier is done. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2935.54s)]
*  Now he's going to be a gatekeeper. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2938.1s)]
*  And this is who we're going to use. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2940.66s)]
*  He's a stepping stone for Saint Denis. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2941.86s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2943.46s)]
*  Saint Denis is going to be our new star. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2943.78s)]
*  So we're taking a boxing mentality. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2945.14s)]
*  If you take the mentality that the best thing for the UFC is that the fights are most [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2946.98s)]
*  interesting, it's not a Saint Denis wins or if Poirier wins, it's that the fight is [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2952.5s)]
*  most interesting. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2956.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2957.06s)]
*  And if you look at it through that lens, then you'll also understand Ian Gary versus MVP. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2957.3s)]
*  MVP second fight in, you're like, whoa, the boxing mind is, well, you might have a new [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2964.5800000000004s)]
*  star here. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2970.02s)]
*  And then this other guy's, one of them is not going to be a star if they lose. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2971.6200000000003s)]
*  So in boxing, you would keep these two as far away. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2974.6600000000003s)]
*  As far away. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2976.9s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2977.46s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2978.1800000000003s)]
*  We do the exact opposite. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2979.2200000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2980.7400000000002s)]
*  So you have all these media guys like going into 300 media guys, the fucking guys that [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2980.98s)]
*  are on the internet, whatever you want to call these guys. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2986.18s)]
*  I don't call them journalists. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2987.7799999999997s)]
*  I was skeptical of 300. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2988.58s)]
*  They fucking know nothing about this sport and they know even less about the business [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2990.1s)]
*  of this fucking sport. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2996.4199999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2997.3799999999997s)]
*  So, you know, I literally just drown out all that fucking noise about people who think [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=2997.94s)]
*  they know what they're fucking talking about. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3003.8599999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3005.62s)]
*  Because literally none of them do. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3005.8599999999997s)]
*  And on the business side, we're doing shit that's never been done before. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3007.7799999999997s)]
*  I'm going into the fucking sphere in September. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3011.3799999999997s)]
*  Why? [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3014.8999999999996s)]
*  Why am I doing? [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3015.7s)]
*  I don't have to fucking do this. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3016.3399999999997s)]
*  How much money I've already spent on this thing? [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3017.62s)]
*  I'm $14 million in on this fucking show. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3020.02s)]
*  And it's not till September. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3022.9s)]
*  On just the video stuff? [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3024.3399999999997s)]
*  Because the video stuff is the most expensive. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3025.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3028.18s)]
*  Dude, this is going to be fucking, I'm telling you. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3028.42s)]
*  And the reason is it's never been done before. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3030.98s)]
*  Nobody's ever done a live broadcast out of the fucking sphere. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3034.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3037.3799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3037.7s)]
*  And when you look at you two and these other guys that spend the money to go in there, [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3038.3399999999997s)]
*  it's amortized over 40 events. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3042.42s)]
*  That's what they're doing. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3044.1s)]
*  It's a month long residency for that reason. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3045.3799999999997s)]
*  I'm doing one. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3047.62s)]
*  I got to come in and we got to figure this whole fucking thing out in one fucking night. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3048.8999999999996s)]
*  And this is going to be a fucking love letter to the Mexican people. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3054.2599999999998s)]
*  I have this thing, huge boxing fan. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3059.22s)]
*  So I have this thing with Mexicans, man. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3061.7799999999997s)]
*  When you tell somebody, I got goosebumps telling you this right now. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3063.9399999999996s)]
*  When you tell somebody you fight like a Mexican, it's the biggest fucking compliment you could [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3066.8999999999996s)]
*  ever fucking give somebody. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3071.7799999999997s)]
*  Right? [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3072.8999999999996s)]
*  Some of the baddest motherfuckers that have walked the face of this earth have been Mexican. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3073.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3076.58s)]
*  And the Sphere show is on Mexican Independence Day. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3077.06s)]
*  And it's going to be the greatest fucking love letter to the Mexican people of all time. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3080.58s)]
*  They're pulling up. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3084.9s)]
*  I'm so fucking excited. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3085.7s)]
*  Do we have the whole card? [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3086.34s)]
*  I'm not saying shit about the card until we get there. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3090.26s)]
*  Give us a name, Daley. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3092.66s)]
*  Give us a name. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3094.1s)]
*  Well, think about all the best Mexicans that we have on our contract. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3094.58s)]
*  Yeah, we can say that. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3096.98s)]
*  And it's pretty much guaranteed they're all going to be there. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3097.54s)]
*  Plus. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3099.78s)]
*  Is there a BMF title? [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3100.18s)]
*  Plus some big guys that aren't Mexican. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3101.14s)]

*  That's Mexican fighter. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3107.4599999999996s)]
*  Never know. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3108.66s)]
*  All right, guys. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3109.22s)]

*  So when you're deciding these fights, the fights that oftentimes the public look at through a boxing lens and go, [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3314.98s)]
*  they're setting this guy up to fail, is the mentality, and did you start this early on, [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3321.2200000000003s)]
*  if we don't put our prospects up against each other, we're just going to have easy wins and it's going to be boring like boxing. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3327.3s)]
*  When you get to the fucking top five, top three in the UFC, you've been through the fucking gauntlet. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3335.38s)]
*  So, you know, right now in boxing and always in boxing, WBC, IBF, WBA, da da da da da, right? [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3341.54s)]
*  You go, well, who's the best? [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3348.34s)]
*  And these guys are going to fight each other. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3350.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3352.1000000000004s)]
*  I don't know who the, if you are the fucking world champion, there's no fucking questioning. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3352.42s)]
*  Who the best is because you've already run through, you know, the baddest fucking people in the world in your weight class. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3357.3s)]
*  And I now understand why you get annoyed by media because I remember when Sean was, [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3363.86s)]
*  Suga Sean was coming up and he was getting that there was this narrative that like he was being protected, right? [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3369.78s)]
*  And I remember, matter of fact, Sean was with us in Phoenix. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3375.7000000000003s)]
*  I think we were doing a show in Phoenix and we watched, no, no, no, what did we watch? [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3379.1400000000003s)]
*  We watched, was it the KG fight? [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3382.1000000000004s)]
*  I think so. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3385.7000000000003s)]
*  No, I think it was Haini Garcia. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3386.66s)]
*  But, yeah, but and he was getting this like rep like, oh, they're being protected. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3388.66s)]
*  They're protecting their golden goose, whatever. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3393.54s)]
*  And I remember, it's so funny. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3395.14s)]
*  I remember the yawn fight. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3397.62s)]
*  I was like, oh, they're done with them. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3398.8999999999996s)]
*  They're going to feed them to yawn. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3400.5s)]
*  They don't think he's got it. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3401.54s)]
*  That's my mentality coming from boxing because that's what you would do if you're a boxing promoter. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3403.2999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3408.5s)]
*  And then him getting that dub changed his trajectory. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3409.7s)]
*  So maybe that's what you got to do. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3413.14s)]
*  Maybe you got to put him into the fire immediately. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3414.5s)]
*  100%. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3416.5s)]
*  100%. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3417.38s)]
*  If you make it into the fucking UFC, right, you're not fighting easy fights. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3418.58s)]
*  There is no feeding the golden goose. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3424.18s)]
*  And how the fuck is he the golden goose? [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3426.1s)]
*  There's no tomato. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3427.62s)]
*  When we just fucking found him, he's never won a fucking world title. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3428.02s)]
*  You don't know. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3433.3s)]
*  You fucking test these guys. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3434.02s)]
*  Sorry, there's this idea with boxing, I think, which was like. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3435.38s)]
*  Well, now they're saying it about, oh, Jesus, Bo. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3438.9s)]
*  Bo Nichols. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3443.7s)]
*  Now they're saying about Bo Nichols. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3444.8199999999997s)]
*  Oh, Bo Nichols fucking. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3445.8599999999997s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3446.8999999999996s)]
*  It's like. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3447.54s)]
*  Now I understand the frustration. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3448.18s)]
*  Because you're like, I'm making the best fights. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3450.02s)]
*  And then when I do make the best fights, you say that I'm throwing someone out. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3452.98s)]
*  And when he wins easily, you're like, I'm protecting him. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3456.18s)]
*  So you're like, I can't win no matter what fight I make. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3459.7s)]
*  And they're the interesting fights. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3462.66s)]
*  So I understand you go there and you go, fuck the media. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3464.66s)]
*  OK, now it makes sense. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3466.66s)]
*  Because they'll never be happy. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3468.02s)]
*  They have to find a way to criticize. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3469.22s)]
*  And it's not even that they'll never be happy. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3470.2599999999998s)]
*  They don't know what the fuck they're talking about. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3472.9s)]
*  It's one of the irritating things, but it's one of the greatest things about the business, too. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3476.8199999999997s)]
*  Let's say I came on here today, right? [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3482.8199999999997s)]
*  And I wanted to talk to you guys about the big cricket game this weekend. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3484.9s)]
*  I know. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3488.74s)]
*  You'd be the only fucking one. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3489.94s)]
*  My point is, when you talk about fights, everybody has an opinion. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3492.42s)]
*  Because everybody thinks they're a fucking expert. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3497.14s)]
*  Nobody thinks they're an expert about fucking cricket and some of these other sports. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3500.18s)]
*  But fighting, everybody has an opinion. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3504.2599999999998s)]
*  One reason or another, you don't like his fucking attitude. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3507.2999999999997s)]
*  Like, if I brought up fucking Jake Paul, pretty much everybody in the room [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3510.18s)]
*  and the other room wants to see Jake Paul get knocked out. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3514.18s)]
*  So you got the reason why you hope Tyson would pull this off. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3516.8199999999997s)]
*  Did you help set that up? [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3520.9s)]
*  Because I know you're close with Tyson. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3522.18s)]
*  God, no. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3523.46s)]
*  When this fight happens, Tyson will be 58 fucking years. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3525.62s)]
*  I'm worried about him. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3528.1s)]
*  On no, under any circumstances, a fucking almost 60-year-old man [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3529.3s)]
*  shouldn't be fighting a 27-year-old fucking guy under any circumstances, [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3534.34s)]
*  even if it's Mike Tyson. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3537.6200000000003s)]
*  So it's just this fucking ridiculous. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3538.5800000000004s)]
*  Now, do you think he can pull it off? [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3540.82s)]
*  Do I think Tyson can land a shot? [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3544.34s)]
*  If Tyson hits him. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3546.02s)]
*  But if Tyson lands it, what happens to the internet if Tyson knocks out Jake? [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3547.54s)]
*  My biggest problem with the Jake Paul thing is and how this plays out is, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3551.46s)]
*  when he actually fought somebody who was a boxer, [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3556.26s)]
*  who had the same type of record he has, who was his age, and who was his size, [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3559.86s)]
*  he fucking lost. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3564.5s)]
*  So they're never going to go that fucking route again. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3566.5s)]
*  Right? [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3569.0600000000004s)]
*  Close fight. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3569.46s)]
*  And then they're trying to pull this whole narrative. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3570.0200000000004s)]
*  Like when people, I saw some guy the other day say, [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3571.94s)]
*  when are you going to stop fighting gimmick fights? [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3574.5800000000004s)]
*  You're going to call Mike Tyson a gimmick? [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3576.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it is a gimmick fight. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3578.5800000000004s)]
*  But I find him, I would never fight anything else but gimmick fights if I'm him. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3580.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3584.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3584.58s)]
*  I mean, he has to maybe- [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3585.14s)]
*  If you can keep getting paid, right? [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3585.94s)]
*  Tens of millions of dollars? [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3587.7s)]
*  100%. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3588.58s)]
*  You'd do it. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3589.2999999999997s)]
*  So then why are you so concerned about that? [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3590.58s)]
*  If you got people that are fucking dumb enough to pay for that shit, you fucking- [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3592.1s)]
*  It's on Netflix, you don't even have to pay now. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3596.58s)]
*  Huh? [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3598.4199999999996s)]
*  It's on Netflix, you don't even have to pay. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3598.66s)]
*  Brilliant move too because you don't have to go pay. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3601.14s)]
*  Everybody has fucking Netflix, so just turn it on. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3603.8599999999997s)]
*  Netflix wants something. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3605.7799999999997s)]
*  I'll turn it on, see what happens. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3606.98s)]
*  So why are you so against the fight? [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3608.3399999999997s)]
*  Is it really just because of Mike Tyson? [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3609.8599999999997s)]
*  I'm not against it. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3611.3799999999997s)]
*  Oh, I thought- [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3612.1s)]
*  I love Mike Tyson. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3612.58s)]
*  Okay. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3613.7s)]
*  He's fucking almost 60 years old. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3613.94s)]
*  So you're just worried for his health. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3615.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3617.2200000000003s)]
*  But even though you see the way he's training and the way he looks- [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3618.02s)]
*  My fucking back is killing me today. Killing me. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3620.26s)]
*  I have no idea why. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3623.06s)]
*  I guess it's because I'm 50 fucking 4. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3624.66s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3626.34s)]
*  That's reasonable. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3627.62s)]
*  I'm 54, so I guess that's why my back is fucking killing me today. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3628.1s)]
*  Yeah, so Mike is- [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3631.46s)]
*  This guy's 27, he's in his fucking prime as a human and- [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3632.34s)]
*  Just fucking- [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3637.62s)]
*  But the internet explodes. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3638.58s)]
*  And I love Mike and nobody wants to see Mike get beat by this fucking jerk off. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3639.54s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3642.7400000000002s)]
*  That's the thing. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3644.1s)]
*  I think no one wants to see Mike lose. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3644.9s)]
*  Well, also you and Mike are close, right? [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3648.1s)]
*  Yeah, I fucking love Mike Tyson. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3649.78s)]
*  Mike Tyson was one of the guys that I fucking idolized growing up and one of the guys that [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3652.18s)]
*  made me love boxing as much as I do. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3658.1s)]
*  Didn't you tell me a story about like, you know, Mike was going to do something, [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3660.1s)]
*  you're like, let me make some calls for you. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3665.7s)]
*  And then you like got Shark Week for him or something? [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3667.54s)]
*  Yeah, when he was fighting. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3668.82s)]
*  He was fighting and I said, don't fight. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3669.78s)]
*  I'll fucking, I'll help you make money doing other shit or whatever. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3673.46s)]
*  So I got him a show on Shark Week and he's like, so wait a minute, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3676.5s)]
*  let me get this fucking straight. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3680.34s)]
*  So I've been fighting my whole life. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3681.7000000000003s)]
*  This is what I fucking do. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3683.38s)]
*  You're worried about me so you can throw me in the ocean? [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3684.98s)]
*  That's his point. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3689.0600000000004s)]
*  He's like, fuck you, Dave. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3689.86s)]
*  I didn't think about it that way. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3692.5800000000004s)]
*  So apparently the day that they shot that episode of him on Shark Week, [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3693.6200000000003s)]
*  everybody on set was fucking terrified because he was so freaked out by the whole [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3698.5s)]
*  shark thing. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3702.7400000000002s)]
*  He was literally ready to beat the shit out of everybody on set and fucking. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3703.46s)]
*  I probably shouldn't have gotten him a shark week show. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3708.5s)]
*  That was probably a bad idea. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3710.42s)]
*  Now I want to go back to what you were saying, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3712.02s)]
*  what we were talking about earlier with interesting fights. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3713.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't think I know anything about fighting. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3715.38s)]
*  I know I know nothing about fighting. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3718.1000000000004s)]
*  What do you look at and say, this is an interesting fight? [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3719.94s)]
*  What is that criteria for you? [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3722.34s)]
*  So a couple of things. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3724.6600000000003s)]
*  You take styles. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3726.98s)]
*  Styles make fights. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3729.22s)]
*  So stylistically, you try to put together the best fights that you possibly can. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3730.34s)]
*  You got some up and coming guys. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3734.1s)]
*  You'll get a guy like a Saint Denis or Sean O'Malley, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3736.18s)]
*  some of these kids that are so talented that they're blowing through guys that are on their level. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3742.42s)]
*  So then you start to think, is he ready for this guy who might be a top 15 ranked guy? [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3747.3s)]
*  Is he ready for a 13? [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3752.82s)]
*  Is he ready for this? [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3753.94s)]
*  And there's only one way to find out. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3755.06s)]
*  You got to test them. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3757.3s)]
*  So you got to look at a guy's age. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3758.26s)]
*  Once you get these kids that are undefeated, right? [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3759.94s)]
*  I'll give you an example. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3766.1s)]
*  Perfect example. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3767.7s)]
*  This one plays out exactly right. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3769.14s)]
*  You have Ian Gary, who's undefeated, been the UFC for a while, taking on the older MVP, [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3770.98s)]
*  who just came in and beat Kevin Holland. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3780.34s)]
*  Very exciting. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3782.98s)]
*  Either way, this is going to go. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3784.9s)]
*  Ian's undefeated and he's in the rankings now and on his way to a possible title shot. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3786.34s)]
*  MVP comes in, he's been fighting in another organization, just beat Holland. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3793.78s)]
*  England versus Ireland. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3799.06s)]
*  There's so many different little pieces and parts that go in. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3802.1800000000003s)]
*  But these two, who's going to win that fight? [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3805.94s)]
*  That's the thing. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3809.2200000000003s)]
*  It's just so hard. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3809.7000000000003s)]
*  Who the fuck knows? [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3810.98s)]
*  Yeah, the UFC is going to win that fight. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3812.26s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3814.98s)]
*  So you don't know who's going to win is what makes that fight so fucking great. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3816.5800000000004s)]
*  When you do these fights in boxing, all you have to do, you don't have to know [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3821.2200000000003s)]
*  one fucking guy involved in the fight. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3826.82s)]
*  You don't even have to know who they are. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3828.42s)]
*  Go look at the odds. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3829.94s)]
*  Whoever the guy is that's the favorite and it's usually by a huge number, [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3832.02s)]
*  it's guaranteed that guy's going to fucking win. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3836.7400000000002s)]
*  In the UFC, there are no fucking guarantees no matter what the odds are, who they are, [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3839.2200000000003s)]
*  what the deal is. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3843.78s)]
*  Saint Denis, I'm sure was a huge favorite in the Poirier fight. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3846.34s)]
*  Poirier fucking walked through him. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3849.54s)]
*  Okay, what do you do when you have a fighter that has a boring style, but is incredibly good? [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3851.38s)]
*  It depends on what that style is. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3861.0600000000004s)]
*  That style is usually wrestling. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3862.42s)]
*  These guys that can lay it down. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3864.9s)]
*  So what you do is you try to match them up with a guy who's got really good take down [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3868.1800000000003s)]
*  defense so it stays on the feet or the guy can get back up. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3872.98s)]
*  So what you want to do is you take the guy who's the dry hamper and fucking goes in [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3878.26s)]
*  and does that to you and you find a guy who has great take down defense and good hands. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3882.42s)]
*  So now he has to see if he has hands and if it does get down to the okay wow wow wow wow wow [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3887.38s)]
*  that's interesting. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3894.9s)]
*  I'm curious, how did you learn the importance of storytelling? [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3897.86s)]
*  I know more about lower ranked UFC guys than I do about the highest ranked boxers ever [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3900.98s)]
*  and I don't think that's an accident. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3906.34s)]
*  Where did you learn that from? [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3908.26s)]
*  Who inspired that and then how did you start to implement that? [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3909.62s)]
*  It's one of the things that we try to do early on. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3911.86s)]
*  No matter what your fucking story is, there's always some type of storyline in a fight [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3915.78s)]
*  and that's what you have to get people sold on more than a fight. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3921.46s)]
*  I can tell you this fight is going to be great or whatever, [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3925.3s)]
*  but you have no rooting interest. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3927.38s)]
*  You want to create a rooting interest. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3928.7400000000002s)]
*  I mean I just did it with my bull. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3930.66s)]
*  So my bull was taking on a fucking cowboy. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3933.94s)]
*  My bull's buck rate at the time was like 88 or 89 percent. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3937.3799999999997s)]
*  Right? [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3941.2999999999997s)]
*  This is Twisted Steel? [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3941.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3942.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3942.8999999999996s)]
*  PBR. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3943.2999999999997s)]
*  And the cowboy that he was going up against that night had beat him already and rode him. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3943.54s)]
*  What was his name? [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3948.98s)]
*  Oh I can't remember. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3949.7s)]
*  I can't remember what his name was. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3950.66s)]
*  But going into that thing, if he rides my bull he gets ranked into the top 10 [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3953.2999999999997s)]
*  and could go to the finals and all this shit. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3958.8999999999996s)]
*  So it's basically you can make anything a fight, right? [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3960.58s)]
*  And create a rooting interest. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3964.02s)]
*  Then people go, I don't give a shit about bull riding, but holy shit this is Dana's bull. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3966.2599999999998s)]
*  He's beat everybody in the last however long. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3970.98s)]
*  This guy actually rode him once. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3973.46s)]
*  If he rides him again he fucks, you know what I mean? [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3975.46s)]
*  Now there's an, okay I'm interested in this. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3977.86s)]
*  I want to see if this guy rides him or doesn't ride him. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3980.34s)]
*  Was that something you always knew or did that develop over time? [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3982.18s)]
*  Yeah, no I've always been into it. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3984.8199999999997s)]
*  You always have to create a reason for somebody to fucking care to watch something. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3986.58s)]
*  That's why the show works on Spike. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3991.2999999999997s)]
*  It's like you got into the characters on the show. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3995.06s)]
*  Well it's like the Olympics. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3997.94s)]
*  When you go into the Olympics you don't know any of these fucking kids, right? [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=3999.94s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4002.74s)]
*  You know right in blue. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4003.22s)]
*  But there's a storyline behind it and there's, you know, the other thing is what's at risk? [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4003.62s)]
*  What's at risk here? [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4012.1s)]
*  Well it's America versus fucking, you know, England or America versus this or that. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4013.78s)]
*  Who's the American person and why do I care about them and who's the English person? [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4020.42s)]
*  Why do I, I don't want to like them so that the American will win or vice versa. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4024.42s)]
*  I mean you always have to have what's at stake. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4028.9s)]
*  So you're intentional with that when the fighters are young. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4032.9s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4035.46s)]
*  So you're building them up from young. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4036.02s)]
*  Yep. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4037.94s)]
*  So if you look at what we do with the Contender series, right? [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4038.42s)]
*  Which is the best fucking show on TV. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4042.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4044.34s)]
*  The best unsigned fighters in the world come in and it's not about winning. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4044.98s)]
*  I don't give a fuck if you win or lose. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4050.98s)]
*  I want to see who you are. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4053.3s)]
*  I want to see what you got. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4054.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4055.46s)]
*  It's about, this is your fucking job interview and you have three fucking rounds to show me who you are. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4055.94s)]
*  Get after it. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4062.6600000000003s)]
*  These fucking kids come in and they fucking go. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4063.78s)]
*  And in that we tell their story, who they are, where they come from. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4066.5800000000004s)]
*  So before you ever set foot in the UFC, if I sign you, millions of people have already seen you fight. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4070.74s)]
*  So it's the same thing with looking for a fight. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4076.58s)]
*  When I go on the road looking for a fight, millions of people see these kids fight before [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4079.2999999999997s)]
*  they ever set foot in the UFC. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4083.4599999999996s)]
*  So we already start the storytelling before they even get in the UFC. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4084.8199999999997s)]
*  Is there anything that the UFC does to either help or incentivize the fighters to show their personality? [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4088.5s)]
*  Because we see people like McGregor, Stylebender, like they sell themselves [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4093.7799999999997s)]
*  in tandem with how the UFC helps us. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4098.9800000000005s)]
*  I don't give a fuck if you're a deaf mute. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4100.9800000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4103.54s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4103.9400000000005s)]
*  I could care less. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4104.34s)]
*  That does not matter to me. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4105.14s)]
*  Are you a bad motherfucker? [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4107.54s)]
*  Are you a bad motherfucker? [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4109.54s)]
*  If you get somebody that has the Connor McGregor, Ronda Rousey, you know, [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4111.38s)]
*  sugar, Shaw, no matter type of personality, that's just a home run. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4115.9400000000005s)]
*  That's just a plus. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4119.22s)]
*  God, that's nice. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4119.860000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4120.34s)]
*  But in this sport, you can't do anything based off, oh, let's see what their personality is like. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4121.46s)]
*  Are you a bad motherfucker? [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4128.1s)]
*  If you're the baddest motherfucker in the world, people don't give a shit about your personality. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4129.7s)]
*  They want to see you fight. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4134.66s)]
*  Yeah, Khabib. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4135.62s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4136.82s)]
*  Okay. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4137.46s)]
*  What about, that's right, he's a pious, religious dude and people will soon unto anything. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4137.7s)]
*  Okay. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4142.82s)]
*  Now, what about, speaking of Connor, is this marketing on Connor's behalf? [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4143.7s)]
*  The video of him partying? [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4149.14s)]
*  Is he? [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4150.42s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4150.9800000000005s)]
*  I honestly don't know. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4152.1s)]
*  You know, he opened a bar out there. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4154.1s)]
*  But is he like, I'm going to leak a video in my bar? [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4157.22s)]
*  It seems it could be controlled, right? [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4160.34s)]
*  It's in my bar, I'm partying, I'm with my people, everything is, and then it comes out. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4163.06s)]
*  Now Chandler's like, oh, maybe he's not taking this that serious. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4167.9400000000005s)]
*  Maybe I could take my foot off the gas. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4170.34s)]
*  I'm just, or is this he's actually not taking it serious? [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4172.1s)]
*  I will tell you this, and I don't ever like to compare people to Muhammad Ali, [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4175.62s)]
*  because to me, he's the fucking, you know, and fuck what he did in fighting just as a human, [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4179.22s)]
*  what that guy accomplished, right? [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4184.02s)]
*  But let me give a fuck what anybody says. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4185.38s)]
*  Ali, Connor, both level when it comes to mental warfare. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4188.26s)]
*  Really? [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4194.26s)]
*  The two best of all time when it comes to mental warfare. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4194.9800000000005s)]
*  That's why it just seems so... [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4197.38s)]
*  Wait, break that down? [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4198.9800000000005s)]
*  I want to watch. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4200.18s)]
*  So Muhammad Ali... [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4201.38s)]
*  Wait, Ali would get it here. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4202.26s)]
*  I know Ali, but I wonder why you put... [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4203.54s)]
*  If you look back at Ali and you look at what he did to George Foreman in Africa, [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4205.54s)]
*  you look at what he did to Joe Frazier, I mean, throughout his entire fucking career. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4209.22s)]
*  Joe Frazier fucking hated Muhammad Ali so fucking badly. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4213.14s)]
*  You know, he'd show up at his camp outside and fucking do all this shit. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4216.9800000000005s)]
*  He would predict rounds. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4220.660000000001s)]
*  He would... [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4222.26s)]
*  I mean, he'd call an uncle. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4223.22s)]
*  He would come up with fucking incredible poems and sayings and things that he would do [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4224.42s)]
*  leading up to the fight. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4228.18s)]
*  And then you look at Connor McGregor. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4230.02s)]
*  He's picked rounds. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4231.62s)]
*  He's fucking, I mean, the mental warfare that this guy had on so many of his fighters. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4232.9800000000005s)]
*  Although he wanted to tear his head off going into that fight. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4236.58s)]
*  100%. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4239.46s)]
*  100%. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4240.66s)]
*  And he would make these guys play into his game, get into their heads, fucking embarrass them [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4241.860000000001s)]
*  and outwit them in every way, shape and form. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4249.62s)]
*  The Eddie Alvarez fight going into Madison Square Garden, you know? [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4253.7s)]
*  He is literally at Ali's level when it came to mental warfare. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4259.22s)]
*  So then when you see a video like him at the club leading up to a fight, [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4262.9800000000005s)]
*  do you get upset seeing that? [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4266.66s)]
*  Or is it part of the warfare? [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4268.66s)]
*  At the end of the day, I'm at a place right now with like the Connor McGregors and the [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4270.259999999999s)]
*  John Joneses where, you know, they've sort of laid the foundation of their legacy and [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4274.259999999999s)]
*  what they have and they've made a shitload of money. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4282.42s)]
*  And it's at the point now where when these guys do show up and fight, it's fun. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4284.9s)]
*  It's fun when they show up and fight. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4289.7s)]
*  But the greatest fight, listen, I'm going to say right here right now, [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4290.98s)]
*  the greatest fighter to ever live, ever, is fucking John Jones. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4294.339999999999s)]
*  When you look at John Jones, he's never lost a fight. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4299.54s)]
*  Wow. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4301.78s)]
*  UFC and boxing or just UFC? [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4302.259999999999s)]
*  Ever. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4304.179999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4304.98s)]
*  Because when you really think about fighting, put two guys in a room and who fucking comes out? [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4305.379999999999s)]
*  John Jones walks out of that fucking room every time. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4311.62s)]
*  And, you know, it's almost like, you know, when you see John on camera and if you were [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4314.179999999999s)]
*  in here talking to John Jones, it's almost uncomfortable for him to do this shit. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4320.58s)]
*  But John Jones beats the fuck out of people. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4326.5s)]
*  Right? [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4330.66s)]
*  And when you talk about truly right now in Islam, I love you, Islam and everything, [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4331.54s)]
*  the fact that John Jones is number two on the pound for pound list is fucking, [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4336.42s)]
*  it just goes to show how fucking stupid the media votes on that. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4340.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4345.3s)]
*  Then it just goes to show you that they have no fucking idea. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4346.02s)]
*  They know nothing about this fucking sport. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4349.06s)]
*  John Jones has never lost a fight ever. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4351.62s)]
*  And when you talk about what it really means to be pound for pound, [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4354.1s)]
*  you know, Volkanovsky moved up and it was a very fucking close fight the first time. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4357.06s)]
*  John Jones moved up and absolutely fucking decimated. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4361.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4365.620000000001s)]
*  The greatest heavyweight that was out there right now. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4366.18s)]
*  He doesn't go for that fucking arm bar. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4368.9800000000005s)]
*  He beats Francis Nganyu and becomes the heavyweight champion. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4371.06s)]
*  John Jones walked through him like it was fucking nothing. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4374.18s)]
*  And when you really think about what pound for pound means, John Jones is the pound for [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4378.34s)]
*  pound best. When you watch the video of him and Cormier and they don't know that they're [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4382.74s)]
*  alive and being filmed. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4387.62s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4388.5s)]
*  And Cormier says, I had to come over there and spit in your fucking face right now. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4389.0599999999995s)]
*  And John Jones says, I would fucking kill you. I'm not saying I would fucking kill you. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4392.58s)]
*  John Jones has like German shepherd dogs that he fucking do all the attack shit, [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4399.54s)]
*  shoots guns. John Jones has a very fucking dark side to him. Right? [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4404.0199999999995s)]
*  And when you talk about who the baddest motherfucker in the world is. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4408.66s)]
*  I like your example about baddies. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4411.38s)]
*  You put two fucking dogs. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4413.06s)]
*  I'm just telling you, John Jones during the craziness. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4415.46s)]
*  Of all the things that he has. He's got German shepherds. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4418.58s)]
*  This guy's a black guy with German shepherds. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4422.18s)]
*  He's that fucking guy. He's not just fucking like, [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4424.74s)]
*  when all the craziness was going on during the pandemic and everybody was rioting and [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4428.18s)]
*  all this shit was going on. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4432.900000000001s)]
*  He was ready. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4433.78s)]
*  Do you know that John Jones was like downtown, like ripping spray paint cans out of kids' hands. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4434.5s)]
*  He's fucking the fuck up my town. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4439.54s)]
*  Maintaining order. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4442.0199999999995s)]
*  I'll beat your fucking ass. Get the fuck out of here. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4442.9s)]
*  Like John Jones is the fucking baddest dude to ever fucking, to ever be involved in Congress. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4445.06s)]
*  Is that what most fighters probably, if they were honest, would admit? [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4451.86s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know. I think John Jones is one of those guys [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4455.7s)]
*  that isn't going to really be appreciated till he's gone. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4459.38s)]
*  And then everybody's going to go, holy shit. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4461.78s)]
*  But the guy's never lost a fight. He's the youngest champion ever in UFC history. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4463.62s)]
*  I think he was 23. He's in his 30s now. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4468.42s)]
*  And he's fought fucking everybody and he's never lost. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4471.62s)]
*  What do you want for John, for the rest of his career? [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4475.38s)]
*  Like, do you want the Aspen all fight? [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4478.18s)]
*  Do you want like, I mean, listen, what I want and what's going to happen, [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4480.02s)]
*  two totally different things. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4484.74s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4486.02s)]
*  That's the other thing with dealing with John Jones. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4486.9s)]
*  You don't know what's going to happen, but you know, he fights Steve Amiochich, [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4488.66s)]
*  the greatest of all time versus the greatest heavyweight. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4493.46s)]
*  You see how that plays out if John Jones wins and he fights Aspen all. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4496.42s)]
*  And if he beats Aspen all, it's just like, what do you say? [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4500.26s)]
*  I'll go toe to toe with anybody for the rest of my life. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4505.94s)]
*  I'm already saying it now that he's the greatest ever. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4509.54s)]
*  When you think about all the greatest boxers, all these guys, [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4513.78s)]
*  Who's your number one boxer? [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4517.54s)]
*  You get in a room this big, John Jones can fucking grab you. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4518.66s)]
*  That's it. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4522.58s)]
*  And once he puts his fucking hands on you, you're done, man. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4523.06s)]
*  And if you're in a scenario where it's only one guy's walking out of the room [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4525.9400000000005s)]
*  and this guy gets on top, you're dropping fucking, [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4529.06s)]
*  let's not even talk about illegal shit that you can do. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4531.620000000001s)]
*  You do not want to fuck with John Jones. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4534.580000000001s)]
*  He's got German Shepherds. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4536.26s)]
*  And, did I mention he's got like German Shepherds? [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4539.3s)]
*  And shit like that, he's like all into that shit too. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4543.3s)]
*  This dude will fucking kill you every way that you can possibly be fucking killed. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4546.1s)]
*  Okay. I mean, that's just it. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4550.5s)]
*  Wow. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4552.18s)]
*  Do you remember the first time you heard the name John Jones? [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4552.82s)]
*  And did you know he was a bad man the first time you saw him? [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4554.9s)]
*  No. But once he started fighting, you know, he's a young kid comes in, starts fighting. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4557.139999999999s)]
*  It was when, I'm trying to think of the fight now that happened. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4561.299999999999s)]
*  I can't fucking remember the first one. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4565.299999999999s)]
*  I talked about this about a year ago, but then when I really noticed John Jones, [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4567.0599999999995s)]
*  you know, we already knew that he was tough and a star, [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4572.179999999999s)]
*  but he was walking through people. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4574.9s)]
*  And a lot of times you'll see these guys that walk through guys, [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4576.66s)]
*  then once they get tested and they get pushed and adversity comes, they break. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4580.18s)]
*  Then came the fight with, [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4586.5s)]
*  ah, Jesus Christ, Swedish kid. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4590.98s)]
*  Yeah. Gustafsson. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4593.22s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4594.82s)]
*  Yeah. Alexander Gustafsson. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4595.38s)]
*  Gustafsson, right? So him and Gustafsson fight. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4596.0199999999995s)]
*  And Gustafsson takes him into the fucking deep water. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4599.14s)]
*  And he's hitting him with fucking elbows and all this fucking shit. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4601.7s)]
*  And now that we look back on John Jones, we know the real shit. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4604.82s)]
*  That was going on. That's the other thing. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4609.7s)]
*  If you want to fuck with John Jones, he was partying [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4611.54s)]
*  and doing fucking crazy shit through his entire camps. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4615.46s)]
*  He was doing shit that most people couldn't get up and go to fucking work the next day, [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4619.62s)]
*  let alone get into a fucking five round title fight with the baddest people in the world. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4623.54s)]
*  That's what he was doing at this time. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4627.54s)]
*  And he fucking gets through that Gustafsson fight. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4629.62s)]
*  And that's when I really started to say, this dude might be one of those. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4632.74s)]
*  Special. Is there a time where you guys have to step in and go, hey, [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4638.0199999999995s)]
*  you're going to ruin everything if you don't get your life together? [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4644.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4648.9s)]
*  Do you try to do that? [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4648.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4650.0199999999995s)]
*  Do these guys listen in those moments? [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4650.259999999999s)]
*  Of course. But they're dealing with grown men that are wired completely different. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4651.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4657.7s)]
*  Everybody in this fucking building, let alone the room. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4658.099999999999s)]
*  Probably everybody in this fucking city block. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4662.58s)]
*  And you can't babysit these guys. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4664.9s)]
*  It's like, how can you keep them from spending their money? [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4669.86s)]
*  You can't. How can you keep them from doing this? [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4672.98s)]
*  You can't. We do the best we can to help these guys [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4675.0599999999995s)]
*  in every way, shape and form in their personal life and professional life. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4680.1s)]
*  But you're dealing with grown men that are wired completely different than the rest of the world. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4683.22s)]
*  Yeah. I think that's the part that's hard for most people to realize is the wiring. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4687.38s)]
*  Because they're putting their own expectations on a fighter. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4691.46s)]
*  And that fighter is waking up and that day begins very differently. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4694.34s)]
*  You know what's crazy? So many people say to me, [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4697.62s)]
*  when you talk to people that aren't real fight fans and aren't in the fight world, [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4700.259999999999s)]
*  I feel sorry for these guys. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4703.38s)]
*  You know what's crazy? They feel sorry for you. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4706.179999999999s)]
*  You'll never experience that level. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4708.9s)]
*  Plus you wake up every day and get in a car and sit in bumper to bumper traffic. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4712.74s)]
*  And you sit in a cubicle every day. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4718.34s)]
*  And you never achieve the type of things that these people... [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4720.42s)]
*  These guys fight one time, then they go fuck off and do whatever they want to do. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4723.06s)]
*  Till they think they want to fight again. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4727.46s)]
*  Then they come back and they test themselves against literally all the best in the world. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4729.780000000001s)]
*  You're saying when they're practicing, when they're training and... [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4735.38s)]
*  Or you're saying the actual fight. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4738.1s)]
*  When they actually go in and fight. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4739.22s)]
*  They're always testing themselves in front of the entire world. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4741.3s)]
*  You versus another person on the world stage. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4744.740000000001s)]
*  You put yourself out there like that. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4748.18s)]
*  It takes a very unique special type of person. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4749.620000000001s)]
*  What do you think John Jones is walking around every day knowing [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4753.06s)]
*  that there's seven billion people on the planet and there's not another person that could beat him up? [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4756.1s)]
*  I can let you know that's how I walk around feeling. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4764.1s)]
*  What does that do to your fucking head? [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4766.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, that's great. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4768.5s)]
*  There's not another human being... [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4768.900000000001s)]
*  Like who's the Usain Bolt? The Jamaican sprinter. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4770.9800000000005s)]
*  He must feel pretty good knowing he's the fastest. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4774.42s)]
*  Imagine knowing not a single human being could beat you up on the planet. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4777.860000000001s)]
*  It's fucking crazy. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4783.06s)]
*  It's true. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4785.54s)]
*  And the funny thing is with most guys, most guys think they can fight and they fucking can't. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4786.26s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4791.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4791.700000000001s)]
*  Most guys, most fucking guys are walking around right now. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4792.1s)]
*  That's the nice thing about like... [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4796.18s)]
*  Think they can. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4797.46s)]
*  And a guy like fucking John Jones and the Khabibs and the fucking... [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4798.34s)]
*  These guys in the world would literally walk right through fucking almost every guy on the planet. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4802.02s)]
*  Isn't that fucking... [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4808.580000000001s)]
*  I see those cauliflower ears. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4809.620000000001s)]
*  You got it, brother. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4813.700000000001s)]
*  You got it. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4814.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's more scary than like a red bandana. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4815.860000000001s)]
*  Well, the scary thing is about UFC guys, it's like Sean O'Malley. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4818.660000000001s)]
*  If Sean O'Malley didn't do all the crazy shit with the hair and the clothes and all that shit, [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4822.820000000001s)]
*  and he looked normal, 100% of guys that saw Sean O'Malley would think they could whoop his ass. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4826.42s)]
*  Interesting. Skinny, tall, dude loves video games. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4832.02s)]
*  One fucking punch. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4835.38s)]
*  Game over. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4836.580000000001s)]
*  That kid hits like a fucking truck. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4837.620000000001s)]
*  He does. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4838.9800000000005s)]
*  So, yeah, it's... [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4839.86s)]
*  Fight business is pretty fascinating. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4841.86s)]
*  Okay, we're almost there. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4843.219999999999s)]
*  You... business takes off, people are loving it. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4845.219999999999s)]
*  It's still not as big as boxing. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4849.38s)]
*  When does it take the step past boxing? [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4854.099999999999s)]
*  And what does that feel like? [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4857.62s)]
*  So, what's interesting is... [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4859.78s)]
*  Do you even envision it even? [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4860.82s)]
*  You're creating a new sport. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4863.38s)]
*  Do you envision it being bigger than the thing that you spent most of your life doing? [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4864.58s)]
*  Well, that's the other thing that everybody told me. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4868.42s)]
*  This will never be bigger than boxing. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4870.42s)]
*  This will never be bigger than boxing. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4871.9400000000005s)]
*  We know how to motivate Dana. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4872.9s)]
*  It is very easy to motivate Dana. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4874.34s)]
*  You'll never quit gambling. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4876.5s)]
*  So, one of the things that I started to notice about boxing was [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4879.78s)]
*  it started to fall apart at an amateur level. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4884.18s)]
*  I was involved in the amateurs back then and it was really dirty and fucking corrupt. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4886.1s)]
*  Then you saw NBC drop the box off. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4892.74s)]
*  Remember they used to have the Olympic box offs before the Olympics? [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4898.18s)]
*  Floyd fought on NBC, Oscar De La Hoya. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4902.34s)]
*  I mean, all these guys that were moving up, they all fought on NBC to lead into the Olympics. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4904.900000000001s)]
*  They got rid of it. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4910.42s)]
*  Once it starts to fall apart at an amateur level and we were gaining traction and starting more people... [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4911.860000000001s)]
*  If you're a younger guy, you were going to train in MMA instead of fucking boxing. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4918.34s)]
*  Yeah, I remember that shift starting to happen amongst my friends. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4922.820000000001s)]
*  I'm going to go train in MMA instead of boxing. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4926.66s)]
*  It was my friend's kids. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4928.1s)]
*  That's when I noticed it. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4929.38s)]
*  My friend's kid started taking jujitsu. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4930.5s)]
*  I was like, what? [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4933.860000000001s)]
*  Because when you're young, you take Taekwondo or karate or some shit. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4934.74s)]
*  When he said, yeah, I put my kid in jujitsu, I was like, oh, it's out of here. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4938.42s)]
*  I was like, UFC is out of here. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4941.54s)]
*  That was our biggest thing. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4943.860000000001s)]
*  Our thing was I grew up in an era where fucking John Wayne movies, he'd hit a guy, he'd go down. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4945.14s)]
*  You didn't jump on him and start beating the shit out of him. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4953.38s)]
*  You stood him back up and you fucking hit him again, right? [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4955.22s)]
*  It was unfair. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4960.42s)]
*  It was unmanly. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4961.38s)]
*  It was whatever you want to call it to jump on a guy and start beating his ass. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4962.34s)]
*  Then the other problem was we were like, how is anybody going to understand what's going on [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4965.9400000000005s)]
*  on the ground with the jujitsu? [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4969.62s)]
*  So two things, Joe Rogan, who was fucking instrumental in the commentary because he [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4971.860000000001s)]
*  would start telling you what was happening before it actually started to happen, right? [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4978.740000000001s)]
*  Joe's good at talking. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4984.42s)]
*  He's setting them up for an arm bar. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4985.3s)]
*  Expressing and explaining things and laying it out. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4986.82s)]
*  Then jujitsu just took off like fucking wildfire. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4990.18s)]
*  Everybody started taking jujitsu. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4993.54s)]
*  Now there's an education about what's happening on the ground and you don't have these people [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4996.5s)]
*  confused and it looks like they're just hugging. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=4999.78s)]
*  100%. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5001.38s)]
*  You know what they're setting up. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5001.86s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5002.82s)]
*  So you lift the IQ of the audience. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5003.38s)]
*  Like I said, I felt like boxing started to fall apart in an amateur level. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5006.58s)]
*  It was completely falling apart. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5010.42s)]
*  I felt like we started to gain traction. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5014.42s)]
*  I grew up in the 80s and 90s. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5018.1s)]
*  I grew up, I mean, went through high school and graduated. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5020.9s)]
*  I always felt then that it was like all old money. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5025.14s)]
*  Old money was the only way you could... [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5028.66s)]
*  And to try to be bigger than established companies like boxing was impossible and [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5030.58s)]
*  everybody would tell you it was impossible. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5037.14s)]
*  That's not the case these days. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5040.74s)]

*  The alcohol selection on door dash is top shelf. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5389.7s)]
*  What a good word choice. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5392.74s)]
*  Beer, wine, mixers, mocktails for your boy and more can be delivered straight to your door. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5394.099999999999s)]

*  bottle of something as a gift using door dash is a no brainer. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5411.38s)]
*  So get your drinks in hand without lifting a finger with door dash and use the code flagrant [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5414.66s)]
*  to get 25% off up to $15 in value when you spend $35 or more on drinks through door dash. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5420.58s)]
*  This is for eligible users only. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5428.02s)]
*  That means if you're 12 years old, this don't apply to you. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5429.38s)]
*  Terms apply. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5431.78s)]
*  Like I said, you must be 21 plus or older to drink alcohol, drink responsibly, delivery [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5432.42s)]
*  and promotions available only in select markets. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5436.82s)]
*  Are there some cultures that make it difficult to break into either on like a social level [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5439.379999999999s)]
*  or like a political level like into India or even China? [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5443.54s)]
*  Yeah, but it doesn't, you know, one of those crazy, we've been trying to get India, [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5446.339999999999s)]
*  the UFC in India for a long time, just, you know, and that power slap is fucking massive. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5451.299999999999s)]
*  Is it really? [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5456.74s)]
*  How can you slap? [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5457.46s)]
*  No, in India, Southeast Asia, fucking China, Brazil already has like two knockoff leagues down there [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5460.0199999999995s)]
*  and it started in Russia and Poland. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5467.54s)]
*  Why is it so big in India? [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5470.82s)]
*  Did you ever see the thing that they do where they run and slap? [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5473.3s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5476.0199999999995s)]
*  That's like a fort there. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5476.98s)]
*  It's like a wrestling, a wrestling. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5478.18s)]
*  So yeah, and here's the thing about power slap. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5479.78s)]
*  It's like to some people that aren't, like you guys have embraced the UFC and, [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5482.42s)]
*  you know, the fighting culture and learned a lot about it. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5490.34s)]
*  To other people that don't know, they still don't know what's going on in the ground and [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5492.74s)]
*  things like that. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5496.26s)]
*  Everybody knows what's slapping someone in the face. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5496.66s)]
*  It is the hundred meter dash of fight sports. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5499.38s)]
*  Everybody has slapped someone in the face. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5502.74s)]
*  Everybody's been slapped in the face. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5504.66s)]
*  Everybody gets it. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5506.9s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5507.62s)]
*  And it's fun, snackable fucking content. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5508.5s)]
*  And now you got the guy, the people doing like the, [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5512.0199999999995s)]
*  see the guy where the head spins around and then the other guy with the robot and, [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5513.94s)]
*  those aren't even included in our numbers. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5519.54s)]
*  Those are doing hundreds of millions of views. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5521.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5523.3s)]
*  How do you find those guys? [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5523.78s)]
*  How do you find the power slap guys and how do you train them? [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5524.82s)]
*  So originally what happened was this did exist at a lower level. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5526.9s)]
*  So what I did is I just went in and bought up all the fucking leagues [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5532.099999999999s)]
*  that were already happening, brought those guys into power slap. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5535.38s)]
*  And now that there's money in it, like there's real money in this. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5539.54s)]
*  Guys are buying houses and cars and boats and fucking, there's real money. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5542.98s)]
*  I got 27 fucking sponsors in power slap. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5547.139999999999s)]
*  So once real money comes in, people start taking it seriously. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5551.0599999999995s)]
*  Again, in the early days of MMA, these guys were fighting for free. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5554.82s)]
*  They didn't get paid. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5559.46s)]
*  It actually cost them money to fight in the UFC, right? [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5560.34s)]
*  Or these other organizations. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5563.9400000000005s)]
*  These guys were doing it for free. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5565.54s)]
*  Now they're making money at it. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5567.38s)]
*  Now guys come in and get evaluated at the PI. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5568.58s)]
*  They're going through training and it's all about torque and velocity and speed and all this shit. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5571.62s)]
*  So once you make it a real sport and money becomes involved, everything, [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5577.9400000000005s)]
*  the level just starts to go like that. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5582.26s)]
*  Are there any UFC guys that want to go try it? [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5583.38s)]
*  We have an announcement coming out soon. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5587.54s)]
*  You're going to start to see other athletes from other sports and you know. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5591.62s)]
*  Shot put. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5596.26s)]
*  I was just going to ask like, have you got celebrities or influencers involved? [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5596.900000000001s)]
*  I don't have to. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5600.1s)]
*  But imagine college football. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5601.06s)]
*  How many badass fucking powerful athletes are in college football that don't make it to the pros? [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5603.78s)]
*  And you know, you can make real money here. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5608.74s)]
*  Are there some people? [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5612.259999999999s)]
*  Drake and Kendrick. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5613.0599999999995s)]
*  Are there some people like if I was like, because I haven't watched Tom Powers live. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5615.139999999999s)]
*  If I was interested in getting into it, is there a specific face off or is there a specific guy? [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5618.42s)]
*  So what's starting to happen now is if you watch the reality show that we have on it, [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5622.98s)]
*  our reality show has done 40 million fucking views online. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5626.74s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5629.94s)]
*  So the guys that we have that coach, when we do the reality show, we have guys or coaches. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5631.139999999999s)]
*  So what's starting to happen is like the early days. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5635.86s)]
*  I don't know if you guys know this much about MMA, [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5637.7s)]
*  but in the early days, there were only a couple of places you could go train for MMA. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5640.5s)]
*  Pat Miletic had a camp that he was training people from AKA, [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5644.26s)]
*  which is where Habib and Cormier and all those guys came from. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5652.18s)]
*  And who was the other big camp at that time? [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5656.66s)]
*  There were like three of them. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5659.22s)]
*  So it was very incestuous that they were all training together at some point and [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5661.06s)]
*  going to different things. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5667.78s)]
*  Now, I mean, it's fucking everywhere. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5668.98s)]
*  And you're going to see that now in PowerSlab. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5672.0199999999995s)]
*  There's going to be camps where you go and then eventually it will grow and get bigger [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5673.62s)]
*  and bigger and bigger. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5677.54s)]
*  It's literally, it's fucking identical. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5678.58s)]
*  Everything is identical to when we started the UFC. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5682.339999999999s)]
*  Is there a way to defend at all in it? [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5684.98s)]
*  So can you strengthen your neck? [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5688.74s)]
*  Can you strengthen your F1? [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5690.98s)]
*  That I don't do, but they do. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5692.259999999999s)]
*  So at the PI... [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5694.099999999999s)]
*  Good comparison. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5696.099999999999s)]
*  Wait, what did you say? [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5696.98s)]
*  F1 drivers. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5698.26s)]
*  Like they do a bunch of like neck work. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5699.14s)]
*  That's exactly what these guys are doing. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5700.42s)]
*  So neck work, neck work, work on your shoulders and traps. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5701.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, face, all that stuff. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5707.38s)]
*  The idea is you're just allowing yourself to get hit. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5709.780000000001s)]
*  You can't do anything in defense. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5712.1s)]
*  This will evolve and the training will become, you know... [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5714.1s)]
*  Yeah, as there's more money, you're going to get more guys. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5718.26s)]
*  100%. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5720.18s)]
*  And the big problem with the UFC in the early days is [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5721.14s)]
*  there was no real training for mixed martial arts. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5724.9800000000005s)]
*  You had fucking guys that were kickboxers, guys that were wrestlers. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5728.42s)]
*  Then they were like, well, how does it all blend together? [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5733.06s)]
*  What they used to do is they used to have a kickboxing class, [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5735.14s)]
*  a wrestling class, a jujitsu class, that they'd have to run all around town. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5737.94s)]
*  And then they started to build these camps. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5742.58s)]
*  And then the training evolved to MMA training that it is today. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5744.74s)]
*  And it still continues to evolve. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5749.3s)]
*  Yeah, but it is cool that you see guys that come up with MMA as their discipline. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5750.9s)]
*  Like it used to be singular discipline as a kickboxing guy that learned these other things. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5756.34s)]
*  So true. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5760.9s)]
*  And now there are guys who are MMA guys. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5761.62s)]
*  Almost instinctually, they're rolling into wrestling, into striking. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5764.18s)]
*  And now there's camps all over the world. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5769.46s)]
*  You had three fucking camps when we bought this. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5773.3s)]
*  Even with Izzy's camp, you look at... [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5775.38s)]
*  100%. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5777.0599999999995s)]
*  Look at what they've done in a very short amount of time. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5777.62s)]
*  In a tiny place in New Zealand. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5780.099999999999s)]
*  Absolutely right. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5781.22s)]
*  I remember the first time that I went to London, [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5782.26s)]
*  there was like one guy who had this little tiny fucking gym as big as this place [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5784.42s)]
*  that he was trying to train MMA guys out of. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5788.82s)]
*  Now look at where the sport is. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5791.22s)]
*  When we went to Australia for the first time, which is perfect example of what you're saying, [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5792.9800000000005s)]
*  there was one fucking guy in the country, Elvis Sinisic, that knew MMA. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5798.1s)]
*  And that was it. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5802.82s)]
*  Him and his buddy that he trained with. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5803.38s)]
*  I can't remember Anthony's last name, but there were two guys in the fucking country. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5806.9800000000005s)]
*  Now there's multiple world champions out of that fucking area. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5812.34s)]
*  And tons of people in the top 10, etc. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5815.22s)]
*  Like that overnight. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5818.66s)]
*  So wait till PowerSlap's been around for five fucking years. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5819.62s)]
*  And you feel like a month's in, thank you. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5823.14s)]
*  No question. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5825.46s)]
*  Wait and see the difference in five years. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5826.1s)]
*  Is this in addition to all the time you have at UFC, you're just adding to your workload? [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5828.66s)]
*  Are you offloading stuff? [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5833.9400000000005s)]
*  How is that? [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5835.14s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5835.54s)]
*  So I own PowerSlap with the Fertitta Brothers. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5836.1s)]
*  And I called those guys up and said, I'm into this fucking slap thing. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5839.78s)]
*  I think we should do this. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5843.46s)]
*  You in? [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5845.0599999999995s)]
*  He goes, I'm fucking in. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5845.46s)]
*  So we did it again. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5846.74s)]
*  We also own a company called Throw One. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5848.179999999999s)]
*  Me and the Fertitta Brothers, which is Ridiculousness that's on MTV. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5850.42s)]
*  We own that. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5854.099999999999s)]
*  We own SLS Skate League. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5855.22s)]
*  You can't fucking miss, huh? [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5856.179999999999s)]
*  We own Nitro Circus. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5859.46s)]
*  And we own Travis Patronas Nitro Cross, which is electric car racing. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5862.34s)]
*  After 4th of July, I do 4th of July at my house in Maine. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5867.78s)]
*  I'm flying a NASCAR. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5870.5s)]
*  We're doing a deal with NASCAR. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5871.62s)]
*  We're going to be the electric series for NASCAR. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5873.139999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5875.139999999999s)]
*  We're working on that deal right now. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5876.34s)]
*  So is your passion building businesses? [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5877.7s)]
*  I like taking niche sports. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5884.179999999999s)]
*  You know how many times I've been offered deals like, [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5885.94s)]
*  hey, we got an NBA team coming to Vegas. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5888.74s)]
*  We'd like to talk to you. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5890.58s)]
*  We got this and that. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5891.46s)]
*  So those kind of businesses like [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5892.66s)]
*  are for multi- they're like toys for multi-billionaires, right? [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5895.3s)]
*  Multi-billionaires buy these things and they lose money on them. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5899.06s)]
*  But the equity grows over decades. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5901.62s)]
*  And then when they fucking die, the family sells the fucking team. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5904.900000000001s)]
*  Or, you know, or Cuban just sold, you know, he bought it for a few hundred million, [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5908.1s)]
*  for a few billion. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5911.62s)]
*  I like taking niche sports that people don't think work [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5913.9400000000005s)]
*  and making them fucking work. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5917.62s)]
*  That's what I like to do. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5918.74s)]
*  Were there any businesses you tried to scale but didn't work exactly how you wanted? [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5919.62s)]
*  Um, yeah, I'll tell you, the only business I've ever failed at was we bought a- [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5925.14s)]
*  during the crash and 9 and 10, I'm driving to work one day [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5933.06s)]
*  and all the fucking car dealerships are closed. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5939.7s)]
*  You remember the bottom fell out in the market, [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5942.26s)]
*  the housing market fucking collapsed and all that shit happened, right? [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5944.26s)]
*  And I'm like, there's lots of good fucking people [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5947.3s)]
*  who need a car, especially in Vegas, and don't have the credit now [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5950.5s)]
*  because the fucking house foreclosed or whatever it is. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5957.86s)]
*  So I bought a car dealership. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5960.66s)]
*  Let me tell you what, it was a fucking shit show. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5964.66s)]
*  And the only thing that fucking saved me, me and my partner did it, [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5968.1s)]
*  me and one of my best friends, we bought it together and tried to run this thing. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5971.46s)]
*  And I didn't lose on it. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5975.94s)]
*  And the only reason I didn't lose money was because I bought the fucking land. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5978.259999999999s)]
*  So I bought the dealership itself, I bought it outright. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5983.219999999999s)]
*  Like me. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5987.54s)]
*  And I own the dealership. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5988.0199999999995s)]
*  Getting fucking murdered on the car side of the business. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5990.82s)]
*  What were the cars? [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5993.0599999999995s)]
*  Fucking murdered. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5993.78s)]
*  What was the brand of car? [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5995.0599999999995s)]
*  Um, it was used cars. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5996.66s)]
*  So it was a used car dealership. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=5998.66s)]
*  And we're getting fucking murdered, right? [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6001.94s)]
*  People are fucking taking the cars and not paying for them. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6004.9s)]
*  So we got to go fucking repossess them. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6009.0599999999995s)]
*  And before we get it back, they destroy the fucking car. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6011.78s)]
*  So it is the shittiest, dirtiest business. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6014.099999999999s)]
*  You wonder why when you go into these car dealerships, these guys don't wait. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6017.139999999999s)]
*  The people sell it. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6019.7s)]
*  I'm telling you right now. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6020.58s)]
*  You need John Jones to repo. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6021.46s)]
*  People you fucking deal with that fucking will not pay their car payments are [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6023.78s)]
*  unfucking believable. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6027.94s)]
*  And they'd rather destroy the car than fucking pay for it. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6028.9s)]
*  So we're getting fucking murdered. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6031.62s)]
*  So we decide an exit strategy to get out of it. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6033.46s)]
*  Now the world changes and everything starts to go this way again. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6036.26s)]
*  And I own the fucking land. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6041.14s)]
*  So when we sold the car dealership, we made all our money back. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6042.9s)]
*  On the land itself. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6046.1s)]
*  So somebody just got rid of the car dealership. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6047.14s)]
*  100%. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6048.82s)]
*  If real estate didn't go back like this, I would have got fucking death. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6052.26s)]
*  You should have turned those cars into MMA rings. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6056.9s)]
*  You would have made your money back. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6059.78s)]
*  Off of his question, is there a business that you could have invested in, [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6061.379999999999s)]
*  didn't and regret it? [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6064.259999999999s)]
*  Like I think Mark Cuban and Uth. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6065.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6066.099999999999s)]
*  So that was the Maloof family that owned the Poms. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6067.0599999999995s)]
*  They were absolutely instrumental in the Golden Knights coming to Las Vegas. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6072.98s)]
*  And I love the Maloof family. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6079.0599999999995s)]
*  They're fucking great people. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6080.339999999999s)]
*  I've always had an incredible relationship with them. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6082.259999999999s)]
*  So they first came to me and said, hey, [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6085.139999999999s)]
*  we're bringing hockey to Vegas and this and that. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6087.62s)]
*  And I was like, hockey in Vegas? [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6089.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6091.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6092.0199999999995s)]
*  I ain't gonna work. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6092.259999999999s)]
*  Golden Knights is fucking massive. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6094.42s)]
*  They've already won fucking championships and everything else. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6096.74s)]
*  So. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6099.38s)]
*  But again, that's a sport that's already established. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6099.7s)]
*  I don't even think that would get you going. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6101.54s)]
*  You like taking the niche sport and blowing it up. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6102.9s)]
*  Hockey's already one of the big. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6105.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6106.5s)]
*  And I didn't really get the hockey thing in Vegas. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6107.0599999999995s)]
*  I didn't see it coming. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6109.139999999999s)]
*  So. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6110.0199999999995s)]
*  But yeah, I could have invested in that. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6111.139999999999s)]
*  I didn't. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6112.98s)]
*  But as far as like nobody's ever come to me and been like, [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6114.36s)]
*  yeah, we're going to start this thing called Google. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6117.5599999999995s)]
*  And we didn't. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6119.08s)]
*  I didn't invest in it. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6120.36s)]
*  There's never been anything like that. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6121.48s)]
*  Okay. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6122.839999999999s)]
*  I'm curious on the topic of people pitching you ideas. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6123.32s)]
*  I mean, you were saying people just come in as Shark Tank. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6125.5599999999995s)]
*  What is the one mistake that people make when they pitch you an idea [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6127.719999999999s)]
*  that makes you immediately go, nah, I'm good? [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6130.679999999999s)]
*  Nothing really. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6133.4s)]
*  It just depends on the product. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6135.0s)]
*  I'll tell you an interesting one. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6136.759999999999s)]
*  This fucking guy just came in and met with me. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6138.36s)]
*  He's from New England. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6141.959999999999s)]
*  He already owns the business and it's fucking kicking ass. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6142.84s)]
*  But he's looking to expand and he needs relationships, [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6147.64s)]
*  not just here in the United States, but globally. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6151.400000000001s)]
*  So he takes rice, husks of rice. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6153.88s)]
*  I didn't even know rice had a husk, but rice have husks on them. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6157.32s)]
*  And basically when they get rid of the husk, it's fucking waste. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6160.84s)]
*  And it's a problem like any other type of waste. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6163.96s)]
*  He's figured out how to turn rice husks into wood. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6166.68s)]
*  So you wouldn't know the difference between a fucking real wood floor [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6170.360000000001s)]
*  or wood paneling in the house or roof or whatever [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6175.64s)]
*  from the wood that's made from this husk. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6178.68s)]
*  He could do that. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6180.360000000001s)]
*  I don't even know what the fuck that is. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6181.0s)]
*  I've seen this. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6181.96s)]
*  They've done it with sugarcane paper. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6182.52s)]
*  All waste from agro is huge. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6184.6s)]
*  If they could solve that, you're saving. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6186.68s)]
*  So what's starting to happen is we're starting to get to a place in the world [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6188.52s)]
*  where the population and everything, if we keep fucking smoking trees [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6192.6s)]
*  the way that we are, you know what I mean? [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6197.0s)]
*  We're going to have a fucking problem 50 years from now. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6199.16s)]
*  It's going to be a fucking huge problem for humanity and the planet. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6201.24s)]
*  And this guy has figured it out how to do. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6205.72s)]
*  And the bigger problem is like Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6208.84s)]
*  and these countries like that that are spanning [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6213.32s)]
*  and like building these fucking unbelievable places. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6215.88s)]
*  He can actually go in there and do it with this wood that you would. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6218.84s)]
*  It's just as durable as good wood. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6222.28s)]
*  It looks exactly the same. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6224.44s)]
*  Any type of wood that you would put in, [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6225.5599999999995s)]
*  they can mimic with these rice. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6227.72s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6229.0s)]
*  What a fucking business that is. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6229.96s)]
*  Not only is it a brilliant fucking business [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6232.04s)]
*  but it's great for the fucking planet. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6234.76s)]
*  It's great for humanity over the next 50 years. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6236.68s)]
*  So Lorenzo and I are taking a deeper dive. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6239.16s)]
*  And so he pitches you and your immediate excitement, you tell Lorenzo. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6241.64s)]
*  Yeah, I literally picked up the phone and called Lorenzo and I said [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6246.92s)]
*  we need to take a look at this. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6249.72s)]
*  In front of the guy? [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6250.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6251.4s)]
*  I mean, he's got to be so excited. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6251.72s)]
*  Well, the guy has a real business now but this guy has something really special. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6253.88s)]
*  This can really be really big. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6258.76s)]
*  So that is the excitement. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6261.72s)]
*  At the end of the day, you are an entrepreneur [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6262.84s)]
*  that loves building businesses, especially when people think that there's no chance. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6265.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6270.5199999999995s)]

*  I hate to fucking admit that but I do. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6274.28s)]
*  But it's extra motivation. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6276.28s)]
*  These people that, you know, I love negativity. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6277.48s)]

*  to give me my money because they wanted me to fucking wait and see if I'll keep playing [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6436.92s)]
*  and, and fucking lose just all these little things that if you are a fucking gambler, [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6440.679999999999s)]
*  you know what I'm talking about. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6444.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6446.04s)]
*  Caesar's has none of that shit and every one of the fucking dealers want you to win [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6446.84s)]
*  because I take care of fucking all the dealers. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6451.4s)]
*  And it's just, it's a good vibe and a good energy. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6453.32s)]
*  And I, I play baccarat and Caesar's baccarat is fucking packed wall to wall with Chinese. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6455.24s)]
*  Chinese have good fucking gambling vibes, man. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6462.2s)]
*  Chinese are fucking absolute degenerate fucking baccarat players. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6464.759999999999s)]
*  No much, no much. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6469.88s)]
*  They will sit there from fucking six o'clock at night till 10 o'clock the next morning [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6471.48s)]
*  playing baccarat. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6476.28s)]
*  They're all upbeat and fucking good energy and I fucking love it. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6477.5599999999995s)]
*  So what I love about those are all the things that I love about Caesar's Palace in Vegas. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6480.92s)]
*  And then the other thing is, oh, and the thing with Caesar's too, [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6486.4400000000005s)]
*  is if you're a big player, every Christmas they have this, they open up all their ballrooms [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6489.8s)]
*  and the ballrooms are packed with fucking snowmobiles, motorcycles, TVs, electronics, [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6495.32s)]
*  jewelry, clothes, everything. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6500.84s)]
*  And you can go in there and shop for Christmas and do whatever. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6502.28s)]
*  So Linnae, who's my head of PR, she's in the other room here. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6504.6s)]
*  I give her the stuff and she goes and she gets all the stuff and gives it to the employees, [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6508.919999999999s)]
*  my employees. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6513.16s)]
*  So we use all my fucking points to shop for the employees at UFC. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6514.12s)]
*  And that's another thing I love about them. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6518.759999999999s)]
*  But the other thing is that the biggest casino company in the United States, [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6521.96s)]
*  they have 44 casinos. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6524.759999999999s)]
*  And I love the fact that it's me versus them every fucking night. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6526.36s)]
*  I go toe to toe with the biggest casino company in the world. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6531.48s)]
*  And I'm in this fucking war with them right now. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6534.28s)]
*  Since Jan 1, since Jan 1, I'm in this war with them, [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6538.5199999999995s)]
*  been playing Baccarat and I beat them for $16.5 million. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6541.4s)]
*  Since January 1. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6545.32s)]
*  Since Jan 1. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6546.599999999999s)]
*  So every night is like this fucking war. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6548.2s)]
*  And I've only since Jan 1, I've only lost to them twice, [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6553.5599999999995s)]
*  but I'm still, I have such a fucking big lead on them. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6557.4s)]
*  They need me to get murdered like bad. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6561.16s)]
*  Do you ever go on, what is it called, on tilt or whatever? [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6564.04s)]
*  Is that the term? [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6566.84s)]
*  On tilt. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6568.360000000001s)]
*  Poker term for sure when you're emotional. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6568.68s)]
*  When you just can't stop? [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6570.360000000001s)]
*  On tilt is also. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6571.64s)]
*  Or are you very diligent about the way you gamble? [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6572.200000000001s)]
*  Or you go under a certain level? [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6575.0s)]
*  I'm usually very diligent, but I'm not going to say there's not [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6575.4800000000005s)]
*  been a couple of times. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6578.4400000000005s)]
*  And those are the times that I lose when you fuck up [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6579.240000000001s)]
*  and you stick around a little too long. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6582.120000000001s)]
*  A little too long. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6585.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6585.96s)]
*  Okay. To bring this back to UFC, that event, the energy. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6586.360000000001s)]
*  So think about this too. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6592.360000000001s)]
*  This is what I love too. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6593.64s)]
*  This is not a, by the way, this is a gambling question. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6594.84s)]
*  I'm going to ask you. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6597.0s)]
*  So there's, this is the biggest casino company in the country. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6598.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6602.360000000001s)]
*  And I'm on a fucking run that six o'clock the next morning, [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6602.92s)]
*  emails are flying around the fucking company. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6607.8s)]
*  Like this motherfucker beat us again. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6609.56s)]
*  This motherfucker beat us again. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6611.72s)]

*  I love it. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6615.400000000001s)]
*  I love it. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6616.4400000000005s)]
*  And the other thing that I love about it's the Corona family [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6617.24s)]
*  that owns this, that owns Caesars. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6620.4400000000005s)]

*  Cheater Corona. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6622.76s)]
*  What? [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6624.12s)]
*  Yeah. The Corona family owns Caesars Palace. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6624.6s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6627.8s)]
*  They own the biggest casino company in the country. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6628.6s)]
*  And Gina Corona, the UFC fighter. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6630.92s)]
*  She was, and now she's a makes films. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6633.400000000001s)]
*  She was on Mandalorian and she got kicked off [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6636.04s)]
*  because I think she didn't want to get vaccinated or something. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6639.08s)]

*  And the thing that I love about them too, [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6651.64s)]
*  they're so fucking classy about how they do everything with whatever. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6654.52s)]
*  I'll run into them in the hallways when they're in Vegas. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6658.68s)]
*  They live in Reno, but when they're in Vegas, I'll run into them [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6660.68s)]
*  and they couldn't be classier about it and just classy good people. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6663.160000000001s)]

*  It's what I love to do. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6681.72s)]
*  Final fight, first Spike TV final between Bonner and Forrest. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6683.400000000001s)]
*  The whole card you said was okay. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6692.76s)]
*  You're going into that final fight. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6695.4800000000005s)]
*  The contract is dependent on this final fight. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6698.04s)]
*  The card was not great. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6700.200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6701.56s)]
*  You were saying that. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6701.72s)]
*  It wasn't okay. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6702.280000000001s)]
*  It was not. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6702.92s)]
*  Oh, that. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6703.4800000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6704.200000000001s)]
*  The excitement of going into that final fight. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6705.64s)]
*  Is that the same? [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6710.280000000001s)]
*  As when you're on a run? [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6712.28s)]
*  No, I would say the excitement after that fight and how I felt after that fight. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6713.88s)]
*  I knew, I knew no matter what happened, we had it. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6720.12s)]
*  That's the baccarat run. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6724.2s)]
*  Every night when I walk in to Caesars and I walk into that high limit room, [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6725.32s)]
*  I'm fucking amped up and I can't play. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6729.88s)]
*  Do you know who? [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6733.0s)]
*  Here's the biggest thing. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6734.84s)]
*  It's easy to talk about the wins and winning and it feels good. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6735.96s)]
*  It's much like fighting. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6739.96s)]
*  It's the highest of the highs and the lowest of the lows when you lose. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6743.08s)]
*  But I've been gambling for so long that I've been able to manage that. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6747.56s)]
*  When I get my ass kicked, some people can't handle it and they go into a deep dark depression and [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6752.04s)]
*  they all listen, I don't give a fuck. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6758.76s)]
*  I get up the next day. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6760.2s)]
*  I look at 2024 as a war. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6761.64s)]
*  This year is a war for me. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6765.0s)]
*  And these are all little battles that are fought inside the war. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6767.08s)]
*  Some nights I win, some nights they win. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6770.44s)]
*  But where do we end up at the end of the year? [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6772.36s)]
*  And it's just, it's what I really, really love to do. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6774.84s)]
*  Have you beaten them for a year? [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6777.5599999999995s)]
*  Have you beaten them for a whole year? [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6780.36s)]
*  So you go through at the end of a year, you're either get decimated and you're fucking whatever [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6782.04s)]
*  or you beat them by a margin. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6790.2s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6793.24s)]
*  Or you're even. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6794.5199999999995s)]
*  But that feels good. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6795.64s)]
*  That's just what I like to fucking do. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6796.84s)]
*  What's the most you ever won in a day and the most you ever lost in a day? [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6798.92s)]
*  So I literally have won. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6803.0s)]
*  So what I do in a day is I keep my day at a million bucks. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6805.4800000000005s)]
*  So if I win a million, I leave. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6810.280000000001s)]
*  I've been clipping these guys for a million a night. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6813.56s)]
*  Oh, you mean you stop at the million. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6815.72s)]
*  Yeah, when I beat them for a million. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6817.88s)]
*  So for the last since Jan one, I've been clipping them from anywhere from 800 to a million a night. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6819.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6825.88s)]
*  When I go in and play and when I lose, I'll go guns blazing and go through my whole fucking [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6826.76s)]
*  credit line. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6834.52s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6839.96s)]
*  Do you know how much you lost? [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6840.200000000001s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6841.72s)]
*  Let's stop here. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6842.04s)]
*  No, all time. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6842.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6843.72s)]
*  The wins and losses. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6844.280000000001s)]
*  Me and Hunter were talking about this the other day. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6844.92s)]
*  All time wins and losses. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6846.92s)]
*  And you're talking, you know, probably 20 years of hardcore real gambling. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6848.28s)]
*  You lose six, you walk out of there. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6856.5199999999995s)]
*  What is the first thing you do? [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6859.88s)]
*  It's usually late. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6862.36s)]
*  So I go home and go to bed. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6863.08s)]
*  No milkshake, no nothing, no like sugar high to make you feel better. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6864.2s)]
*  Like, no, no, I fucking just another day. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6868.36s)]
*  Shake it right off. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6872.28s)]
*  Six million. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6872.759999999999s)]
*  Go home, go to bed, get up, go to work the next day and then figure out what the next [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6874.599999999999s)]
*  game plan is. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6877.88s)]
*  But I'm in a position right now with these guys where they're in a unique position because [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6878.52s)]
*  I'm up 16.5 on them. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6885.24s)]
*  So if I keep winning, it just keeps getting worse. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6888.12s)]
*  So I'm eventually going to lose. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6892.2s)]
*  It's eventually going to happen. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6894.84s)]
*  And when I lose, I'll lose six million. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6896.04s)]
*  So they know that. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6897.96s)]
*  They're waiting for the big drops. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6898.6s)]
*  100%. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6899.72s)]
*  So I'll lose six million. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6900.84s)]
*  Well, I'm still up fucking 10 million on them. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6902.92s)]
*  I got to go on a really bad fucking run. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6905.16s)]
*  For them to catch up to me. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6907.72s)]
*  How much skill is there in Baccarat? [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6909.0s)]
*  It's 50-50. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6911.16s)]
*  Oh, it's the closest statistical game. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6912.599999999999s)]
*  It's more than Blackjack. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6915.32s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6916.68s)]
*  Way more. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6917.24s)]
*  What's weird, this is what's fascinating to me. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6917.88s)]
*  Okay. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6921.5599999999995s)]
*  As far as Baccarat, Baccarat has the best odds yet they'll let you play more money on [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6921.88s)]
*  that than they will on. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6926.92s)]
*  You can bet $300,000 a hand. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6927.96s)]
*  And what's the justification from them? [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6930.04s)]
*  And Blackjack's 75. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6931.639999999999s)]
*  So why? [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6933.72s)]
*  Blackjack's way harder to win. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6934.5199999999995s)]
*  You know how many multiple nights you're going to walk into a Blackjack game and win [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6935.96s)]
*  a million? [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6940.6s)]

*  Of Baccarat? [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6944.52s)]
*  Have you asked why they do that? [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6945.24s)]
*  Here's the thing of Baccarat. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6946.36s)]
*  300,000 a hand, right? [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6946.76s)]

*  I bet you that actually goes in the favor of the house in some cases because I wonder [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6979.0s)]
*  if people like their competitive spirit, they're like, oh, this is the chance I can win. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=6982.12s)]

*  that's very deep. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=7789.96s)]
*  But I want to just ask you, [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=7791.16s)]

*  A lot of people work hard, man. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=7800.2s)]
*  Yeah, but I believe in- [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=7801.719999999999s)]
*  I guess if you look at all the things that go on [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=7807.4s)]
*  in the outside world and all the people that tell you [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=7809.4s)]
*  what you can't do and what's not possible, [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=7811.48s)]
*  I've built a team of people that I have got on board with me [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=7815.320000000001s)]
*  that agree with me and say, [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=7820.84s)]
*  there's nothing we can't fucking do. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=7822.360000000001s)]

*  You know what I mean? [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=7824.6s)]
*  I like that. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=7825.240000000001s)]
*  And when you build a fucking team of can-dos [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=7825.4800000000005s)]
*  instead of can't-dos, like the Sphere, right? [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=7828.84s)]
*  I said we can fucking do this. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=7833.88s)]
*  And I think this is going to be fun, challenging, [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=7835.72s)]
*  and an experience that we will all look back on [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=7839.08s)]
*  and 10 years ago, we fucking did that and we were first, [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=7843.48s)]
*  just like COVID. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=7846.679999999999s)]
*  And the list goes on and on. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=7848.759999999999s)]
*  There were a lot more reasons why I went through COVID. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=7849.719999999999s)]
*  My team is one of them, [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=7854.2s)]
*  and COVID never really made sense to me. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=7856.92s)]
*  So I don't know. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=7861.32s)]
*  I just built a team of can-dos, not can't-dos. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=7863.799999999999s)]
*  That's awesome. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=7866.28s)]
*  I say again, why am I doing the Sphere? [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=7868.2s)]
*  It's expensive. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=7871.24s)]

*  We kick fucking ass and we do things first [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=7880.04s)]
*  and we do things that people say can't be done. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=7881.96s)]

*  And the other thing that we started to talk about [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8025.08s)]
*  that I wanted to tell you too, [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8026.76s)]
*  I do this show called Looking for a Fight. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8029.96s)]
*  And we go out and we go into different cities [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8031.96s)]
*  and we see what the city has to offer food wise, entertainment, [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8034.679999999999s)]
*  and all this other stuff, culturally. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8038.36s)]
*  And then we go to fights. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8040.679999999999s)]
*  So we like to put ourselves in uncomfortable situations. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8042.04s)]
*  I rode a bull. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8044.6s)]
*  I rode a real PBR bull. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8045.4s)]
*  Jumped in the fucking ocean with sharks [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8047.56s)]
*  in the middle of fucking Florida, [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8049.24s)]
*  which is one of the dumbest things I've ever done [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8050.5199999999995s)]
*  other than bull riding. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8052.36s)]
*  And the worst thing that I ever fucking did [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8054.04s)]
*  was stand up comedy. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8056.76s)]
*  So we came up with this thing. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8058.5199999999995s)]
*  I'll never forget it, David. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8059.96s)]
*  Me, Matt, and Dean had to write our own jokes. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8061.4s)]
*  And I was like, this will be fun because [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8065.08s)]
*  we'll go into a comedy club. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8067.08s)]
*  I've been to comedy clubs. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8068.44s)]
*  There's fucking six people sitting in there [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8069.4s)]
*  people are up until like a big comic shows up. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8071.639999999999s)]
*  There's fucking handful of people in there. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8074.2s)]
*  And you go up and you tell your jokes. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8076.04s)]
*  So we did this thing. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8079.08s)]
*  They promoted that we were going to be there. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8081.0s)]
*  The club fucking sold out. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8084.04s)]
*  Right? This is in LA. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8086.04s)]
*  Club sold out. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8087.08s)]
*  We pull up. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8088.36s)]
*  There's a line down the fucking street. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8088.92s)]

*  And just so you know, I fucking cheated too. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8104.04s)]
*  I had Tony Hinchcliffe write my fucking jokes. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8106.44s)]
*  Matt and Dean wrote their own jokes [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8113.32s)]
*  and had to get up to me. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8115.0s)]
*  I'm not even kidding you. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8117.96s)]
*  I public speak all that there is. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8119.08s)]
*  I'll public speak. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8120.759999999999s)]
*  I'll be driving to the thing and I'll call my secretary [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8121.639999999999s)]

*  I remember hearing the joke. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8322.44s)]
*  And I remember going, I go, listen, he's nervous. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8323.4s)]
*  I was like, all right, maybe we can work out something else. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8326.039999999999s)]
*  That's like a 50-50. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8327.96s)]
*  Either the audience is into it and they love it or not. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8329.08s)]
*  And I remember I called you back and I was like, hey, [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8331.72s)]
*  I don't know about that joke. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8333.8s)]
*  I remember you go, Schultz, are you fucking with me right now? [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8335.08s)]
*  I can't take this when you're going to give me a different [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8338.919999999998s)]

*  And I go, well, listen, I don't want you to bomb. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8341.8s)]
*  And that joke might be a 50-50. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8343.48s)]
*  And I think it states that you don't really care. [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8345.4s)]
*  And you don't give a fuck. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8348.599999999999s)]
*  And then I remember you go, wait, what do you mean? [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8349.88s)]

*  You think you're going to get it. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8355.72s)]
*  I go, oh, I'm going to get the reaction. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8356.519999999999s)]
*  I know what the reaction is. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8358.679999999998s)]
*  I don't give a fuck. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8359.72s)]
*  I wanted to come out and just punch everybody right in the face. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8360.359999999999s)]
*  You said, I just want them to know that I don't give a fuck. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8363.56s)]
*  I was like, oh, well, they'll know that. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8365.32s)]
*  I thought they were going to fucking boo me. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8372.279999999999s)]
*  The amount of fucking pressure on. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8378.599999999999s)]

*  I think you did very well. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8381.88s)]
*  And also a weird situation because your back is to the audience. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8383.56s)]
*  You're in the front row. [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8388.359999999999s)]

*  You can't even deliver to them and see them laughing, which kind of motivates you. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8392.68s)]
*  So you're laughing. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8396.76s)]
*  I was talking to the deus. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8397.32s)]
*  Which is the hardest people to impress because we're like that. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8399.0s)]
*  At least we laugh for a living. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8401.48s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8402.76s)]

*  I didn't feel good for three days after that. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8416.52s)]
*  I didn't feel right. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8418.52s)]
*  Literally the amount of pressure to get up and tell fucking jokes. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8419.800000000001s)]
*  And telling jokes to fucking comedians. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8425.0s)]
*  Oh, not to mention the fact that, what you say, [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8427.0s)]

*  what they do is for weeks when you say yes, [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8446.52s)]
*  you get on calls with producers and comedians and everybody. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8448.68s)]
*  Now, they're writing jokes for fucking Tom Brady, [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8451.800000000001s)]

*  Bill is a man. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8500.04s)]
*  But it was good shit. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8502.199999999999s)]
*  I'm glad you did it. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8503.16s)]
*  Thanks. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8504.119999999999s)]
*  It was the fucking, it's the second hardest thing. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8504.44s)]
*  And you sat there in the line of fire. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8506.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8508.36s)]
*  That's another thing. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8508.68s)]
*  I thought, this is what I thought, [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8509.64s)]
*  because sometimes with these award shows, [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8510.92s)]
*  people come in to do their thing [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8512.28s)]
*  and then they leave and they get a seat filler. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8514.119999999999s)]
*  That's what I thought Kim was going to do. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8516.199999999999s)]
*  I'll give Kim credit. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8517.48s)]
*  She stayed there and they didn't tell me [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8518.36s)]
*  she was going to be there. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8520.52s)]
*  If they did, I would have had something. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8521.24s)]
*  But she was there for the whole time. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8522.52s)]
*  So I give her credit. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8525.24s)]
*  I'll tell you what else I give her credit for. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8526.199999999999s)]
*  She's not an actress. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8527.72s)]
*  She's a fucking reality star. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8529.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8530.36s)]
*  I am not an actor. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8531.32s)]
*  I do reality too. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8532.68s)]
*  Right? [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8533.880000000001s)]
*  So when you do reality, [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8534.44s)]
*  you go in and do what you fucking do. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8535.64s)]
*  Then you have to do some interviews and shit like that. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8537.48s)]
*  It is not even fucking remotely close to acting. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8539.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8541.64s)]
*  She got up there and you could tell [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8542.04s)]
*  she was reading her teleprompter. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8543.72s)]
*  She didn't really have that dialed in. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8545.16s)]
*  They started booing the fuck out of her. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8547.08s)]
*  And you know what? [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8549.48s)]
*  She fucking powered through it. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8550.44s)]
*  She didn't even notice. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8551.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8552.68s)]
*  She fucking powered through it. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8553.4s)]
*  She made it. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8554.6s)]
*  She was just. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8555.08s)]
*  Say what you want about Kim Kardashian. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8555.4s)]
*  She took it like a fucking champ. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8557.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8558.44s)]
*  It is weird because they say with public speaking, [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8559.16s)]
*  you're supposed to imagine the audience naked. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8560.84s)]
*  And with her, it was the opposite. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8563.0s)]
*  But people don't understand when you go up there [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8567.4s)]
*  and you try to fucking, [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8569.4s)]
*  you have to try to make people laugh. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8570.6s)]
*  She tried to tell a funny story about Tom and everything else. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8572.6s)]
*  She had funny jokes. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8575.48s)]
*  And she's getting booed. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8576.36s)]
*  She's the only fucking like woman there speaking [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8577.48s)]
*  that isn't a professional fucking comedian. [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8580.92s)]
*  And you start getting booed and she fucking handled. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8583.64s)]
*  See, I was ready to get booed. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8585.56s)]
*  That's why my second joke was [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8586.68s)]
*  I was ready for the booing. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8588.36s)]
*  And it turned out the other way. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8589.960000000001s)]
*  We're going to get you back up again. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8593.16s)]
*  I fucking guarantee you, you will not. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8594.84s)]
*  We're going to get you back up. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AT9Q7SWm1k&t=8596.6s)]
