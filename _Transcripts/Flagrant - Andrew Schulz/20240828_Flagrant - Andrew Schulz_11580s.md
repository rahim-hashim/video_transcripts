# “Trump Is Shook”, Candace Owens, & The Israel Problem | Dave Smith
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [August 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc)
*  How did the Jews do that? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=0.0s)]
*  Once you can control the web. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1.42s)]
*  There are so many of these Ben Shapiro types. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2.7s)]
*  When Candice was taking the gloves off with black people, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5.8s)]
*  they were all like, yeah. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8.92s)]
*  But then it's like, in this situation, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10.22s)]
*  where the state of Israel has just been mass slaughtering [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=12.34s)]
*  these captive people. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=16.26s)]
*  But as soon as you take the gloves off with them, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=17.8s)]
*  it's like, all of a sudden Ben Shapiro's the woke. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=20.18s)]
*  Basically, Trump's going, wow, they tried to take me out. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=22.56s)]
*  And now he's like, holy shit, it is that easy to take me out. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=24.78s)]
*  I barely survived this one. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=27.740000000000002s)]
*  They will try it again. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=29.64s)]
*  I better behave. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=30.88s)]
*  That seems to be the only explanation [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=31.919999999999998s)]
*  that makes sense to me. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=33.8s)]
*  There's an obvious blueprint for Donald Trump [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=34.76s)]
*  that Donald Trump would always follow. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=37.28s)]
*  And he's not following it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=39.68s)]
*  Trump's shook. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=43.34s)]
*  You know, I really feel like the Democrats deserve to lose. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=44.18s)]
*  And then I see Trump. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=47.72s)]
*  No. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=49.72s)]
*  No. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=50.56s)]
*  No. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=51.379999999999995s)]
*  No. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=52.22s)]
*  What's up, everybody? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=54.72s)]
*  Welcome to Flagrant. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=55.56s)]
*  This week has been quite entertaining on Twitter. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=57.16s)]
*  The discourse online has been, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=61.919999999999995s)]
*  maybe I shouldn't say that, entertaining. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=64.39999999999999s)]
*  I gotta find the right words. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=66.39999999999999s)]
*  I mean, very- What do you mean entertaining? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=68.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's terrifying. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=69.92s)]
*  Engaging? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=71.6s)]
*  Engaging for sure. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=72.72s)]
*  I think the perfect explanation of Twitter- [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=73.84s)]
*  We have Dave Smith here, by the way. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=75.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah! [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=76.92s)]
*  To make sense of this all, okay? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  We need America's sweetheart, dad of two, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=80.08s)]
*  stand-up comedian, political pundit, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=83.36s)]
*  and now endorsed by Joe Rogan as the man [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  to go to for political discourse. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=89.92s)]
*  I don't know exactly what he said, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=92.36s)]
*  but it was something like, genius of our time, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=93.92s)]
*  everything he says is true, something along those lines. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=96.04s)]
*  Something- [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  I don't remember verbatim, but- [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=99.08s)]
*  No, but I really think you just encapsulated [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=101.76s)]
*  the whole thing by just going, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=104.72s)]
*  all right, so the discourse on Twitter has been, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=106.32s)]
*  wait a minute, this is offensive. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=108.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=109.92s)]
*  I mean, like, oh man, this is- [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=110.76s)]
*  How do you even say this? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=112.28s)]
*  I mean, you can't stop looking at it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=113.56s)]
*  It's just, the second I open it up, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=116.12s)]
*  I'm like, the Jews did everything? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=117.76s)]
*  Like, everything! [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=121.2s)]
*  They did what? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=123.12s)]
*  The bad. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=124.8s)]
*  The JFK thing, I had no clue. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=125.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, apparently they did that. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=128.04s)]
*  They did that, what else did they do? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=129.64s)]
*  9-11, apparently. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=131.28s)]
*  But they made a polio vaccine, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=132.72s)]
*  so it's like, it comes down the wash. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  Vaccines, though? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  They made a polio vaccine, now we're back. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=137.12s)]
*  We're back, we're back. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=139.12s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=140.96s)]
*  I think that traditionally would have been the thing [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=141.8s)]
*  that everyone would go, yeah, polio vaccine. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=143.16s)]
*  And now everyone is like, does it give you polio? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=145.84s)]
*  It sure doesn't. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  I don't know anymore. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  It must have said natural immunity. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=149.32000000000002s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=150.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=151.08s)]
*  Dave, can you make a little bit of sense [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  that you were on, well actually, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=153.44s)]
*  can you say how this all started percolating? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=155.28s)]
*  This last week, I think we saw it reach a zenith, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=157.60000000000002s)]
*  as Akash would say. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=161.8s)]
*  Well, with the Candice stuff specifically, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=163.12s)]
*  I mean, she has really touched a nerve. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=166.08s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=169.56s)]
*  I'm terrified of Candice, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=170.76000000000002s)]
*  I hope that she does not fixate with, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  at all have a fixation with me at any point in time, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=174.56s)]
*  and if she does, I apologize, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=177.23999999999998s)]
*  because she will not let it go. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=178.88s)]
*  Have you met her? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=181.16s)]
*  Do you know Candice? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=182.16s)]
*  No. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=183.0s)]
*  She's like the sweetest lady. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=183.83999999999997s)]
*  Like, when you meet her, she's just like a total sweetheart. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=186.64s)]
*  I am terrified. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=188.95999999999998s)]
*  It's very weird, though. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=189.79999999999998s)]
*  Black people are happy she got her eyes off of us right now. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=190.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=192.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=194.28s)]
*  Talk about the dudes, Candice! [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=195.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=197.28s)]
*  Oh, she'll be back. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=198.56s)]
*  I know. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=199.39999999999998s)]
*  I know. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=201.76000000000002s)]
*  Enjoy your moment while she's focused on us. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=202.60000000000002s)]
*  This is a layover. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=204.72s)]
*  She's staying on us, bro. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=205.56s)]
*  She does not play, she will read every book. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, she's very smart, and she dives deep into things, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=209.60000000000002s)]
*  and she's diving right now into some wild conspiracies [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=213.76000000000002s)]
*  that I don't really know, like, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=217.32000000000002s)]
*  I don't know enough about whether she's right or wrong [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=218.72000000000003s)]
*  or whatever, but there is something that I gotta say to, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=221.08s)]
*  like, you know, like, to the thing you're alluding to there, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=225.28s)]
*  it's like, there are so many of these conservative types, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=228.92s)]
*  the Ben Shapiro types, who, when Candice was taking [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=232.48s)]
*  the gloves off with black people, they were all like, yeah. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=235.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=239.28s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=240.12s)]
*  And, like, and look, it's okay to take the gloves off [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=240.96s)]
*  with all groups of people sometimes. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=243.48s)]
*  Sometimes you need tough love. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=245.44s)]
*  But when she was like, I mean, and Ben Shapiro himself [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  will take the gloves off with black people, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=249.84s)]
*  and be like, oh, listen, you wanna know why you have this? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  Because you're committing too much crimes. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=253.24s)]
*  Yeah, you're committing too much crimes. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=255.32s)]
*  How about you stay married? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=256.48s)]
*  How about you don't have kids out of wedlock? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=257.4s)]
*  This, this, this, this. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=259.48s)]
*  Good point. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=260.32s)]
*  But as soon as you... [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=261.16s)]
*  Yeah, what I'm trying to say is... [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=262.0s)]
*  Broken clock is right. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  So he was nailing it, and then. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=263.68s)]
*  No, but then it's like, if you direct any of that energy [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=266.56s)]
*  toward Jewish people, and again, all of these things are like, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=269.16s)]
*  the problem is, like, when you speak in terms of collectives, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=272.72s)]
*  you always get everything wrong. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=275.04s)]
*  Because if you're talking to the black community [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=276.52s)]
*  and you're like, hey, black people, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=277.96000000000004s)]
*  you need to take care of your kids, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=279.0s)]
*  there's like some black dad who's a great dad, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=280.44s)]
*  who's like, who are you talking to? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=282.4s)]
*  I do take care of my kids. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=284.24s)]
*  Also, they know. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=285.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=285.92s)]
*  So black people, we gotta take care of them? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=286.8s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=288.68s)]
*  Thank God this fucking little hat guy [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=289.52s)]
*  told us we gotta take care of them. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=291.0s)]
*  Yeah, like the black guy who's not taking care of his kids [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=292.59999999999997s)]
*  is like, I know I'm supposed to. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=294.32s)]
*  I don't want to. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=296.0s)]
*  I don't want to. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=297.08s)]
*  But, but so like... [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=298.24s)]
*  You have black kids. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=302.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=303.24s)]
*  Yeah, I said I was getting milk on purpose. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=304.68s)]
*  I needed an alibi. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=306.76s)]
*  They're easy when there's these little Jewish kids, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=307.8s)]
*  they don't run as fast, but these black ones will fall. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=309.28s)]
*  So that's the greatest stuff. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=311.52s)]
*  Come back and he goes, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=312.76s)]
*  yeah, it's easy when they're little white kids. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  Sure. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=314.92s)]
*  I take care of them. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=315.8s)]
*  But like again, like look, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=317.84s)]
*  but what Ben Shapiro would say to that, right, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=319.59999999999997s)]
*  is like, okay, but I'm not talking to those people, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=321.71999999999997s)]
*  but I'm talking to, we're talking about statistics here. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=323.48s)]
*  It's like, okay, fine. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=326.03999999999996s)]
*  But look, then in this situation, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=327.08s)]
*  where for the last 10 months, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=330.2s)]
*  the state of Israel has just been like mass slaughtering [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=332.44s)]
*  these captive people in the most horrific way. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=336.64s)]
*  But as soon as you take the gloves off with them, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=340.36s)]
*  it's like, oh, oh, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=342.8s)]
*  all of a sudden Ben Shapiro's the woke. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=344.76000000000005s)]
*  All of a sudden he's the same thing [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=346.48s)]
*  that he's been railing against the whole time. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=347.88000000000005s)]
*  I'm offended. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=349.40000000000003s)]
*  Safe space on college campus and all that. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=350.40000000000003s)]
*  So I'm so disgusted. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=352.6s)]
*  That's don't care about your feelings. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=353.44000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=354.76000000000005s)]
*  All of a sudden they do. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=355.6s)]
*  All Mr. Free Speech and all. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=356.44000000000005s)]
*  So I'm so disgusted with that. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=358.0s)]
*  And I think what Israel's doing is totally wrong. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=359.8s)]
*  But then of course, with all these things, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=362.48s)]
*  there are excesses on the anti-Israel side. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=364.6s)]
*  And I do see that all over Twitter too. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=368.68s)]
*  I mean. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=371.04s)]
*  In my replies, people who are trying to back me up [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=371.88000000000005s)]
*  and say, first of all, I'm Jewish. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=375.56s)]
*  So I'm probably not gonna love, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=376.4s)]
*  I'm probably not gonna love your gas all the Jews comment. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=378.08s)]
*  And then, oh, you didn't like Defcon 300. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=381.15999999999997s)]
*  But then you. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=386.15999999999997s)]
*  You're one of the good ones. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=387.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=389.0s)]
*  Which like, listen, if it ever goes down, I'll take it. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=390.56s)]
*  But for now, for now I don't need it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=393.0s)]
*  But then it's like, you're also like, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=395.15999999999997s)]
*  do you think you're helping me? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=396.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=398.24s)]
*  Like do you think you're helping the argument right now? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=399.08s)]
*  Because now you're making us all look terrible. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=401.03999999999996s)]
*  I think what you do well [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=403.12s)]
*  and I think what anybody who's actually pro-Palestine, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=403.96s)]
*  actually pro-Palestine should do [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=406.47999999999996s)]
*  is really stamp out anti-Semitism. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=408.12s)]
*  Be like, yo, we're not doing that. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=410.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=411.44s)]
*  Israel and Jewish people are different things. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=412.28s)]
*  I don't support what Israel's doing. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=413.71999999999997s)]
*  Jewish people, no issue with you. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=414.76s)]
*  It's a government. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=416.47999999999996s)]
*  100%. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=417.32s)]
*  Especially because that's the tactic [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=418.15999999999997s)]
*  of all the pro-Israeli people. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=420.71999999999997s)]
*  So you're almost embracing their whole thing [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=422.64s)]
*  was that they go, oh, you're criticizing Netanyahu? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=424.56s)]
*  Well, that's because you hate Jews. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=427.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=428.56s)]
*  And then it's like, so if you hand them that also, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=429.4s)]
*  you're falling right into their trap. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=432.15999999999997s)]
*  It's always the same with all these weird, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=434.47999999999996s)]
*  there's always these kind of movements [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=437.24s)]
*  that seem like they're enemies, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=438.76s)]
*  but they weirdly help each other. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=440.28s)]
*  So something like Charlottesville [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=442.2s)]
*  was the best thing for MSNBC. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=445.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=448.44s)]
*  Because they're like, ah, yes, perfect. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=449.28s)]
*  See, these are the Trump supporters. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=450.84s)]
*  Even though it was like 200 people, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=452.71999999999997s)]
*  it was not, that wasn't the 63 million people [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=454.56s)]
*  who voted for Trump. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=457.32s)]
*  But so it's weirdly where if you become the neo-Nazi, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=458.32s)]
*  all you're doing really is helping the progressive woke guy [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=462.88s)]
*  because you're proving their point [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=466.03999999999996s)]
*  that it's you're either us or you're a neo-Nazi, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=467.52s)]
*  whereas all sane people should be like, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=470.24s)]
*  there's some room in between those two. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=473.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=475.08s)]
*  That's a great point. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=475.92s)]
*  So the rampant anti-Semitism [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=476.76s)]
*  completely discredits any logical and fair criticisms [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=480.84s)]
*  of Israel and what's happening right now. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=485.36s)]
*  I wouldn't say it discredits it, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=488.08s)]
*  but it allows a pro-Israel voice to say, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=489.56s)]
*  it allows them to go, well, look at all the same [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=493.56s)]
*  anti-Semitism. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=494.92s)]
*  And you can't discrue them because when I'm on tour, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=495.76s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, it seems like they should too. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=496.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=498.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's really hard to know exactly what's going on [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=499.16s)]
*  with all of that stuff. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=503.56s)]
*  Because in social media, it's almost always accounts [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=504.52s)]

*  I'm like, is this a 14-year-old trolling? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=509.68s)]
*  Is this somebody, is it a 14-year-old who's stepdad [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=512.32s)]
*  just beat the crap out of him or something? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=515.4s)]
*  Or is this a real deal? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=517.5600000000001s)]
*  I have been reading Mein Kampf and I agree with them. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=520.28s)]
*  Is it foreign government that's paying for it [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=523.4s)]
*  and putting money out there? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=525.16s)]
*  Is it our own government? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=526.0s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, really? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=526.84s)]
*  Yeah, they love this stuff. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=528.12s)]
*  I mean, they could. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=529.28s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait, sorry to interrupt. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=530.12s)]
*  So break that down. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=531.88s)]
*  I've heard the foreign government thing. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=532.7s)]
*  I thought this was really interesting. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=533.84s)]
*  So anytime there's dissension within America, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=535.0s)]
*  it behooves our enemies to stoke as much of that [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=537.52s)]
*  as possible, right? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=540.5600000000001s)]
*  So they could just put the juice on it. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=541.5600000000001s)]
*  You can buy ads, you can inflate tweets, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=543.24s)]
*  you can do whatever you want to continue that discourse [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=545.08s)]
*  that is incredibly, let's say, toxic or problematic. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=548.16s)]
*  Why would our own government do it? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=551.48s)]
*  Well, because you already said our enemies are doing it. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=553.16s)]
*  And that's our biggest enemies are in Washington, D.C. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=555.92s)]
*  So, I mean, well, look, think about it like this, right? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=559.9599999999999s)]
*  How would it benefit them, I guess? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=562.9599999999999s)]
*  Well, I'd just say, first of all, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=564.8s)]
*  have our own political leaders and our own corporate media, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=567.04s)]
*  have they not been stoking all these divisions [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=571.8s)]
*  all these years? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=573.92s)]
*  I mean, like, they push it more than anybody. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=574.76s)]
*  It's like, since, basically for the last 12 years, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=577.8000000000001s)]
*  there has been a tsunami of just pushing [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=581.64s)]
*  the most divisive issues from all, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=585.36s)]
*  and I've talked about this many times before, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=588.9200000000001s)]
*  but do you ever see those charts, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=592.08s)]
*  like the Nexus charts, where they track words [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=594.44s)]
*  that are used in the big corporate media outlets, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=596.76s)]
*  and it'll track words like mentions of the word racism [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=599.24s)]
*  in the New York Times, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=603.32s)]
*  mentions of the word transgenderism [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=604.32s)]
*  or toxic masculinity, all these things. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=606.88s)]
*  But it's all at 2011, 2012, it's like, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=609.08s)]
*  and then it skyrockets up, all of them in unison, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=613.12s)]
*  all just started doing it. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=616.52s)]
*  Like election time. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=618.32s)]
*  Well, it was- [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=619.36s)]
*  Well, what was it specific about? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=620.2s)]
*  Well, it was on the heels of the Occupy Wall Street movement [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=621.88s)]
*  and the Tea Party movement, and like all these, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=624.96s)]
*  you got a bunch of leftists standing outside the big banks [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=627.84s)]
*  screaming, we are the 99%, and then all of a sudden, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=630.52s)]
*  the entire corporate media [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=633.76s)]
*  and the entire political class decided, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=635.4s)]
*  what we wanna talk about is transgender bathrooms, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=637.4s)]
*  because that is the burning issue of the day, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=640.1999999999999s)]
*  and it hits right-wingers and left-wingers [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=642.4s)]
*  against each other, fighting over something [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=644.12s)]
*  that is no threat to power whatsoever. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=646.6s)]
*  So once it's class unity. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=648.8s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's, whoa, I think that's a huge thing. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=650.04s)]
*  Okay, slow down, slow down. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=652.4399999999999s)]
*  So there is a, the Occupy Wall Street is this movement [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=653.6s)]
*  that right-wing and left-wing can get behind. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=656.92s)]
*  It was certainly more left-wing than right-wing, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=659.8s)]
*  but the message of it was we are the 99%. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=661.56s)]
*  And we're getting robbed by the 99%. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=665.4399999999999s)]
*  And we're getting robbed by the, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=666.28s)]
*  and they didn't even really mean 99%, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=667.1199999999999s)]
*  they meant like 99.9%. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=669.3599999999999s)]
*  They were like, it's the people who own banks [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=671.3599999999999s)]
*  against the rest of us. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=674.0s)]
*  And the fear of that catch, of that becoming trendy, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=675.7199999999999s)]
*  of that catching on, and there being a unified front [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=679.3599999999999s)]
*  against these banks or these people in power, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=683.0s)]
*  makes them reposition the conversation to something that, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=685.68s)]
*  one, those liberals that are out there [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=689.0s)]
*  have to support, they have to support [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=690.4s)]
*  the pro-transgender argument because if they don't, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=692.6s)]
*  then they're gonna look bigoted. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=695.16s)]
*  Oh wow, it's like the perfect foil. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=696.72s)]
*  Dude, they're such geniuses. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=698.76s)]
*  Listen, they found the perfect thing that, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=699.92s)]
*  first of all, just like you said, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=702.76s)]
*  any left liberal type can't be against, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=704.64s)]
*  because your whole identity is that [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=707.64s)]
*  you're the non-bigoted ones, right? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=708.9599999999999s)]
*  So you can't be against anything that might make you bigoted. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=710.52s)]
*  You've got these bankers at the edge of the building [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=712.36s)]
*  and you're just like, oh, okay, trinities can go to a peak. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=713.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=716.1999999999999s)]
*  And on top of that, right, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=717.04s)]
*  it's that you found the thing, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=721.36s)]
*  particularly with the transgender thing, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=722.2s)]
*  that will make a right-winger's blood boil. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=723.44s)]
*  Oh, so now they're the same group [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=725.96s)]
*  that were about to come together [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=727.4s)]
*  are gonna start fighting again. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=728.6s)]
*  Wow. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=729.88s)]
*  And where do these conversations happen? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=730.72s)]
*  Does this happen organically [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=731.92s)]
*  and then they put a little bit more gas on it, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=733.28s)]
*  or is there like a think tank in the Pentagon [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=735.2s)]
*  that's just like, what do you think? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=740.5600000000001s)]
*  I can say this for sure, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=742.08s)]
*  I think this was a straight CIA op, that's my guess, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=742.92s)]
*  which by the way, they were in, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=747.28s)]
*  there were commercials for the CIA bragging [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=748.68s)]
*  about how they hire indigenous women of color [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=751.16s)]
*  with anxiety issues and all this stuff. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=755.52s)]
*  And they all started pumping it out. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=758.0799999999999s)]
*  And particularly because, look, I mean, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=760.1999999999999s)]
*  you see how much they've just bought off the left. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=762.64s)]
*  There's freaking Bank of America floats [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=765.52s)]
*  at the Gay Pride Parade. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=768.0s)]
*  These guys are riding down on a big bank float. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=770.1999999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=773.5999999999999s)]
*  And this, it was the ultimate, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=774.4399999999999s)]
*  think about the deal from the bank's perspective, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=775.4799999999999s)]
*  where they went, okay, you're mad [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=777.76s)]
*  because we just wrecked the economy [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=779.8s)]
*  and then got bailed out by the taxpayers. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=782.12s)]
*  So here's our deal. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=784.68s)]
*  We will send all of our white executives [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=787.24s)]
*  to diversity training. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=790.08s)]
*  Are we good now? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=792.96s)]
*  Is that a figure? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=793.96s)]
*  And keep looting the American people, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=794.8s)]
*  keep raking in record high profits, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=799.12s)]
*  but we'll focus on all this stuff. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=801.3199999999999s)]
*  And I think that basically it's just that [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=803.28s)]
*  the elite, the ruling elite failed so much on every policy [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=807.48s)]
*  that eventually, that people were waking up. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=812.56s)]
*  And when you had the, I think there was something, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=814.8s)]
*  you had the Tea Party movement [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=816.64s)]
*  and the Occupy Wall Street movement. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=817.8s)]
*  Can you describe the Tea Party movement? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=819.28s)]
*  Well, the Tea Party was, it's like around 2010, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=820.4399999999999s)]
*  I think it started. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=823.64s)]
*  And it also started, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=824.48s)]
*  it started from the Ron Paul campaigns [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=826.3199999999999s)]
*  and in opposition to the banker bailouts. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=828.4399999999999s)]

*  But the way it was positioned was a bunch of racists. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=835.4000000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah, right away, of course, because they- [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=838.24s)]
*  I had no clue that that's what they were pissed off [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=839.72s)]
*  about government spending. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=841.36s)]

*  Did you know that? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=843.44s)]
*  Yeah, I know government spending was the main one, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=844.36s)]
*  but they quickly got positioned as like, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=846.32s)]
*  oh, that's the racist guys. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=848.7600000000001s)]

*  Well, listen, and look, this is like what always happens, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=916.32s)]
*  though they always try to infiltrate these movements [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=919.6s)]
*  and push them into cultural issues. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=922.88s)]
*  This is what happened back with the right-wingers [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=925.36s)]
*  back in the 60s, where they would come in, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=927.72s)]
*  and the New Republic, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=930.52s)]
*  or I'm sorry, not New Republic, National Review, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=933.0s)]
*  and William F. Buckley and these guys, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=935.6800000000001s)]
*  they'd come in and like, so the old right, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=937.72s)]
*  the old right, pre-World War II, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=939.76s)]
*  were always non-interventionists. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=942.9200000000001s)]
*  They didn't wanna fight wars. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=945.08s)]
*  They believed in immigration restrictions, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=946.8000000000001s)]
*  trade restrictions, and sound money, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=948.44s)]
*  like no fiat currency. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=951.0400000000001s)]
*  These were like the things they cared about. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=952.6s)]
*  And then National Review came in, and they were like, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=954.08s)]
*  you know what it really means to be a conservative? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=956.48s)]
*  We're against the homos. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=958.7600000000001s)]
*  Okay? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=960.32s)]
*  These homos are everywhere, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=961.1600000000001s)]
*  and we have to oppose these homos. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=963.32s)]
*  By the way, we're not gonna do [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=964.6800000000001s)]
*  the whole sound money thing anymore. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=965.6s)]
*  We're gonna have a fiat currency. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=966.9200000000001s)]
*  I know we're gonna fight a lot of wars, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=968.08s)]
*  but these homos, man, these homos are all over the place, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=969.2s)]
*  and they're always kind of like throwing you off [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=972.0400000000001s)]
*  of the issues of substance that actually matter, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=974.7199999999999s)]
*  and they're just kind of like, okay, well, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=978.64s)]
*  you know how you guys were against entangling alliances [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=979.8s)]
*  and adventurism overseas? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=982.68s)]
*  Well, we got a war in Vietnam to fight, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=984.16s)]
*  so we're not doing that stuff anymore. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=985.68s)]
*  But you should really worry about whatever. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=987.3199999999999s)]
*  And it's always adjacent to Christianity, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=990.28s)]
*  an issue that is religious, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=993.64s)]
*  that will overtake any government care that I have. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=995.0s)]
*  If you attach it to my, Christianity's against homosexuality, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=999.0s)]
*  you gonna let that happen in this country? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1002.16s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1003.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, because it has to be something [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1004.0799999999999s)]
*  that is part of your core identity. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1005.4799999999999s)]
*  If it's not that important to you, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1007.68s)]
*  you're not gonna latch on. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1009.1999999999999s)]
*  Wow, it's actually, you feel guilty not latching on. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1010.52s)]
*  You feel guilty not having a voice about it. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1012.7199999999999s)]
*  Oh! [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1014.92s)]
*  And I feel, listen, I feel it myself, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1015.76s)]
*  like you guys know me for a long time. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1017.4799999999999s)]
*  Like I'm totally obsessed with all of these issues [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1019.52s)]
*  of like war and money and banking [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1021.88s)]
*  and all like government corruption. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1024.32s)]
*  But I'll be the first to see like [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1026.3999999999999s)]
*  a Libs a TikTok video on Twitter, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1027.8799999999999s)]
*  and I'm like, ooh, what are they doing to these kids? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1029.76s)]
*  What are they doing to the first man? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1031.48s)]
*  What's wrong with this? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1033.08s)]
*  Get that tranny away from those kids. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1033.9199999999998s)]
*  What are you getting out of it? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1035.1599999999999s)]
*  You know, like it's just, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1036.0s)]
*  it pulls at something deep inside. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1036.84s)]
*  And by the way, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1039.0s)]
*  I don't think they should be bringing this stuff to kids. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1039.84s)]
*  I think that's really crazy. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1041.1599999999999s)]
*  But to your point, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1042.0s)]
*  there's probably five times that's happening in America. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1042.84s)]
*  Well, you have no sense. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1044.6799999999998s)]
*  The thing is you have no sense of it. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1045.84s)]
*  You're like, oh, okay, so I mean, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1047.36s)]
*  like my kids don't go to public school, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1048.84s)]
*  and I haven't been to a public school [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1050.48s)]
*  since I was in public school. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1051.76s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1053.12s)]
*  I see the video of this. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1053.96s)]
*  Is this one out of 100,000 teachers are like this? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1055.24s)]
*  Is it one out of a thousand? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1058.52s)]
*  I have no sense of proportion, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1059.9199999999998s)]
*  but I know there's a video there [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1062.76s)]
*  that'll get my blood boiling. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1064.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1065.8s)]
*  But I'm not even saying some of the distractions [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1066.64s)]
*  are important issues, right? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1068.32s)]
*  But like even like a fight over like say abortion [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1069.8s)]
*  or something like that, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1071.8s)]
*  which is a very important issue depending on how you see it. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1072.64s)]
*  Again, it's facing to religion though. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1075.12s)]
*  But right, it also plays on the religious thing, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1076.16s)]
*  but it's also like, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1079.2s)]
*  it doesn't, it's not a threat to anyone in power. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1080.08s)]
*  Like no one in power is threatened by whether [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1083.72s)]
*  you're a pro-choice or pro-life. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1087.16s)]
*  But if you're like, hey, you know, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1088.72s)]
*  I think we should like, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1090.64s)]
*  I think these big banks shouldn't get bailed out anymore. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1091.52s)]
*  Or like, hey, I don't think we should fight these wars [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1093.6s)]
*  that these weapons companies are making [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1095.4s)]
*  hundreds of billions of dollars off of. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1097.0s)]
*  That is a threat to their bottom line. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1099.0s)]
*  I mean, these rich people are gonna get their abortions [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1101.08s)]
*  is my point. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1102.68s)]
*  Yeah, they're gonna find a way. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1103.52s)]
*  How can they be so proficient at like distracting [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1105.16s)]
*  and stoking the culture war [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1108.8799999999999s)]
*  and so seemingly inefficient at everything else? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1110.84s)]
*  Like which government is doing it? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1114.44s)]
*  We talk nonstop about how inefficient government is, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1116.24s)]
*  but the way that you've described it, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1118.76s)]
*  they've masterfully manipulated us for the last what? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1120.12s)]
*  30 decades, 40, 50? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1122.9599999999998s)]
*  I would think they're efficient at getting things. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1124.6799999999998s)]
*  I think they're very efficient. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1126.0s)]
*  I think the government is inefficient model [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1127.08s)]
*  is based off of faulty assumption. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1129.52s)]
*  So when people say government's inefficient, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1133.2399999999998s)]
*  it's almost like, well, look, they took over healthcare, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1135.4399999999998s)]
*  but they're not delivering good healthcare [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1138.08s)]
*  at a reasonable price. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1140.32s)]
*  And you're like, go look at Obamacare. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1141.2399999999998s)]
*  The profits for the giant insurance companies [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1143.6799999999998s)]
*  skyrocketed. They're efficient. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1147.4399999999998s)]
*  Just not for us. They're incredibly efficient. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1148.3999999999999s)]
*  You're assuming that their stated goal [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1150.8s)]
*  is their actual goal. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1153.9199999999998s)]
*  That's fucking, yeah. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1154.76s)]
*  This is interesting. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1155.6s)]
*  They're the most, like what? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1156.4399999999998s)]
*  Were the Nazis efficient at killing Jews? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1158.0s)]
*  I mean, there's nothing more efficient than government. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1160.04s)]
*  It's just always for evil. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1161.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1163.76s)]
*  So that's- [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1164.6s)]
*  Do you think they've lost control of the Psy-Up? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1165.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I think- [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1167.84s)]
*  What does that mean, Mark? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1168.6799999999998s)]
*  Like if you're suggesting, which I'm with you here, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1169.6s)]
*  is that like this is effectively a CIA operation [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1172.0s)]
*  to create a culture war to distract [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1174.9199999999998s)]
*  from like the actual class struggle? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1177.1999999999998s)]
*  Have they lost control over that? [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1180.6000000000001s)]
*  And you get things like January 6th, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1181.68s)]
*  and you get things where it's like [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1183.24s)]
*  we're on the brink of a war. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1184.2s)]
*  Ah, because of new media. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1185.04s)]
*  Because of art- [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1186.52s)]
*  Well, I didn't mean to push this pillow onto you, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1187.3600000000001s)]
*  by the way. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1188.64s)]
*  This is just now. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1189.48s)]
*  You was just the prop. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1190.32s)]
*  He made it a long- [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1191.16s)]
*  He made it a long- [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1191.98s)]
*  You're speaking my language, Mark. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1192.82s)]
*  Question, bro. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1194.08s)]
*  So I think like both things are happening. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1196.92s)]
*  So I would look at it and say [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1199.32s)]
*  they were incredibly effective. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1200.96s)]
*  If their goal, if I'm right, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1203.48s)]
*  and their goal was to start a culture war, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1205.0s)]
*  you'd look back and go, wow, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1206.64s)]
*  they did a really good job. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1207.72s)]
*  Yeah, they could. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1208.8s)]
*  And at the same time, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1210.5600000000002s)]
*  I think what's gotten away from them, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1211.4s)]
*  and this is one of the crazy things [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1213.2800000000002s)]
*  that we're like living through this moment right now, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1214.48s)]
*  is that for the first time, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1217.3200000000002s)]
*  the state has lost the monopoly on the flow of information, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1219.72s)]
*  which is always the most important thing [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1224.72s)]
*  for them to control. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1227.16s)]
*  Always. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1228.24s)]
*  I mean, look, if you think about like [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1229.0800000000002s)]
*  what the government really is, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1230.8000000000002s)]
*  which essentially is the gang that rules the land. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1233.8000000000002s)]
*  The monopoly of violence. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1238.8s)]
*  Well, the monopoly of legal violence. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1240.44s)]
*  So like there's, or I should say more specifically, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1242.44s)]
*  the monopoly on legal aggression. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1245.28s)]
*  Because you can commit violence in self-defense, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1247.8s)]
*  I mean, depending on what state you're in, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1250.1599999999999s)]
*  there's different rules for it. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1251.6s)]
*  But you can't initiate violence against other people. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1253.36s)]
*  But the state can. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1257.04s)]
*  And that's what they have. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1258.08s)]
*  And then they monopolize certain services, right? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1259.52s)]
*  But there's a reason why, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1262.3999999999999s)]
*  why is it that governments just happen to run [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1263.6399999999999s)]
*  like the schools and the post office and the TV channels [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1266.68s)]
*  and the radios. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1271.24s)]
*  Radio makes sense, TV makes sense, school makes sense, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1272.68s)]
*  because you can push propaganda. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1275.5200000000002s)]
*  And I remember we were having a conversation, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1276.72s)]
*  it was actually over the stand. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1278.2s)]
*  You're like, yeah, why do you think [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1279.1200000000001s)]
*  they run the post office? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1279.96s)]
*  I go, I don't know, who would want, I don't know. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1280.8000000000002s)]
*  And you're like, well, how do you get the information around? [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1283.72s)]
*  Yeah, well, at the time, that was it. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1286.24s)]
*  At the time, that was the only way [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1287.0800000000002s)]
*  to get the information around. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1288.3600000000001s)]
*  So you better fucking control it. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1289.72s)]
*  Well, why is it that, but governments never been like, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1291.44s)]
*  we need to have a monopoly on shoes. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1293.72s)]
*  We need to make shoes, because everyone needs shoes. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1297.48s)]
*  It's like actually a real basic name. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1300.16s)]
*  Black people would revolt. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1301.2s)]
*  Because they're not wearing these trashy. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1302.6000000000001s)]
*  Because we need shoes. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1306.0800000000002s)]
*  These shoes don't match my hat. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1307.2s)]
*  No, but the reason is- [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1309.28s)]
*  I'm Trump 1, this is kind of fly. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1310.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know why. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1311.44s)]
*  It's kind of fly. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1312.28s)]
*  No, but the reason is because we need shoes. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1314.1200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1317.0800000000002s)]
*  They don't need us to have shoes. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1317.92s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1318.92s)]
*  And it doesn't, so what's happened- [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1319.76s)]
*  It doesn't benefit their control in any way. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1321.8400000000001s)]
*  And this really is a very new thing. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1324.2800000000002s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1326.3200000000002s)]
*  Is that they're like, I mean, look, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1327.24s)]
*  you see how much they freaked out [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1328.92s)]
*  about Elon Musk buying Twitter. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1330.0800000000002s)]
*  Why would it really matter to these people? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1332.48s)]
*  Just like all the political pundits, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1334.3200000000002s)]
*  all the corporate media, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1336.3200000000002s)]
*  they were nuts over Elon Musk buying Twitter [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1337.64s)]
*  when he said he's gonna make it a free speech platform. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1339.72s)]
*  Real quick, do you think that these politicians [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1341.8000000000002s)]
*  are useful idiots, some of them aware, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1344.88s)]
*  some of them unaware, all of them aware? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1348.4s)]
*  I'm trying to get an understanding. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1352.56s)]
*  Do you think the second people enter government, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1353.96s)]
*  there's a conversation where it's like, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1355.4s)]
*  hey, this is the agenda and this is what we're gonna do? [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1356.68s)]
*  Or do you think they just kind of fall in line [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1358.76s)]
*  and then get nudged in the right direction? [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1360.8s)]
*  I think it's more of the latter. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1362.4s)]
*  It depends on what level kind of you're at. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1366.16s)]
*  I think that for someone who's a freshman congressman, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1368.24s)]
*  no, they just enter and then someone kind of explains. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1372.32s)]
*  They've already got the system locked down. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1375.04s)]
*  It's like, listen, leadership is gonna put a bill forward. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1376.6s)]
*  You can either vote for it or against it. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1379.4s)]
*  You can't amend anything that's in it. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1381.32s)]
*  But if you vote against it when leadership wants you to, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1383.08s)]
*  you're never gonna get put on any committees. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1385.6399999999999s)]
*  You're never gonna rise up the ranks. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1387.2s)]
*  You're never gonna like that. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1388.6s)]
*  Now, the head of the Senate Arms Committee, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1389.6399999999999s)]
*  that dude's talking to the CIA. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1392.6s)]
*  Look, Dianne Feinstein, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1396.4399999999998s)]
*  who was the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1399.28s)]
*  at the time, she came out, she was actually furious [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1402.04s)]
*  about this, but they caught that the CIA was spying on her. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1405.0s)]
*  She's tasked with oversight of the intelligence communities, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1409.04s)]
*  but they're spying on her. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1412.52s)]
*  If there's one person you need to spy on, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1415.84s)]
*  I would say it's the person who's tasked [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1417.92s)]
*  with the oversight of the committee. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1420.0s)]
*  Yeah, that would be one of your first things [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1421.28s)]
*  you're gonna spy on. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1423.04s)]
*  Because what if they're a fucking Russian spy [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1423.88s)]
*  or something like that? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1424.72s)]
*  I think you gotta lock in in that way. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1425.76s)]
*  I like that. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1427.44s)]
*  Good for her catching it, though. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1429.0s)]
*  She's shrewd. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1430.6s)]
*  I don't think she's the one who caught it. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1431.44s)]
*  Someone else, it came out somehow, I can't remember. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1432.68s)]
*  But the point is that there's, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1435.0s)]
*  the real point is that our elected representatives [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1437.08s)]
*  are not who's actually running the gun. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1441.16s)]
*  I think you're sorry, you're also assuming [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1442.88s)]
*  they have good intentions of making sure she's not a spy. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1444.48s)]
*  I think the real problem- [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1448.28s)]
*  Wow, they got proxy wars to start. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1449.12s)]
*  Nefarious intentions of, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1450.56s)]
*  we need something black and white. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1451.8s)]
*  Don't get in the way, don't get in the way, ladies. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1452.64s)]
*  I gotta hold this over her head [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1453.84s)]
*  when we need to push our shit through, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1455.12s)]
*  because oh, you don't want me to expose this about you, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1456.48s)]
*  do you? [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1458.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1458.92s)]
*  That's what I think we would all kind of agree it probably is. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1459.76s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1462.24s)]
*  Okay, so, one thing that I've always been very, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1463.44s)]
*  if I can't compliment you for a second, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1469.04s)]
*  I think a lot of times the people that get, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1470.72s)]
*  what would you call this now? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1472.68s)]
*  I don't even want to call it red pill, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1473.8s)]
*  because I feel like that's too niche, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1474.96s)]
*  but what do you call when you wake up, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1476.48s)]
*  what is the term that people use? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1479.04s)]
*  Red pill used to be our term, [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1480.48s)]
*  but now it means arguing with seven club hoes. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1482.5800000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1487.0800000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1487.92s)]
*  So. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1488.76s)]
*  But bitches be shocked. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1489.6000000000001s)]
*  We can't use that one anymore. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1490.44s)]
*  What is the new one? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1493.6799999999998s)]
*  Don't marry a porn star, guys. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1494.84s)]
*  That's my tip. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1496.1999999999998s)]
*  I love it. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1497.04s)]
*  That was something I thought we just knew in high school, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1497.8799999999999s)]
*  but I guess that's gotta be settled [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1499.96s)]
*  on a lot of different podcasts. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1502.0s)]
*  But I don't know, yeah, whatever it is, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1504.12s)]
*  I don't know that we have the perfect term, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1507.9199999999998s)]
*  but whoever kind of the dissidents are [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1510.6799999999998s)]
*  that just see this whole system as just totally corrupt [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1512.48s)]
*  and fake, and that's kind of why I liked [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1517.76s)]
*  the red pill analogy, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1519.8s)]
*  because it was a great analogy from The Matrix, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1521.08s)]
*  that's like, oh, you take this, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1523.08s)]
*  and you realize that everything [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1524.1999999999998s)]
*  is like this carefully constructed illusion [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1526.3999999999999s)]
*  that is constructed by bad people [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1530.36s)]
*  who don't have your best interest at heart. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1534.3999999999999s)]
*  One thing I think you've done really well [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1537.6799999999998s)]
*  is I think you've managed your emotional state. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1539.1599999999999s)]
*  I think a lot of people that go down this rabbit hole, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1542.12s)]
*  they get incredibly anxious. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1544.6799999999998s)]
*  That's a great point. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1546.24s)]
*  They're miserable, and it's hard to not be miserable [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1547.1999999999998s)]
*  when you start seeing all these institutions [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1549.88s)]
*  that are potentially lying to you. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1551.72s)]
*  So I'm curious, and I wanna go back [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1553.72s)]
*  into more of what's going on, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1556.0400000000002s)]
*  but I'm just curious, how often are you checking in [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1557.0400000000002s)]
*  with yourself so you don't become one of these people [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1560.16s)]
*  who get, they kinda go crazy? [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1563.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, well, no, 100%, and I've seen so much of that, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1565.88s)]
*  and I do sometimes kind of sympathize with those guys, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1569.0800000000002s)]
*  because it is, when you start getting into this stuff, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1573.16s)]
*  it is stuff that's so evil that you're like, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1576.3600000000001s)]
*  it's worth dying over or flipping out over or something. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1580.52s)]
*  Even just, if you just go study the war in Iraq [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1583.44s)]
*  and how these fucking people who wanted this war [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1587.0800000000002s)]
*  for years before 9-11 literally wrote, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1593.88s)]
*  if you go read this, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1597.0800000000002s)]
*  in a project for a new American century, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1598.04s)]
*  which was the think tank of all the neocons, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1599.8s)]
*  the people who, it was like 20 people [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1601.8s)]
*  who were the signatories on it. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1604.0800000000002s)]
*  It was Dick Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1605.8s)]
*  and like Richard Pearl, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1608.76s)]
*  and I think 10 of the 20 went on [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1613.0s)]
*  to have high level positions [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1615.28s)]
*  in George W. Bush's administration. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1616.64s)]
*  And they wrote before 9-11 that our whole plan here [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1618.84s)]
*  is to fight multiple wars in the Middle East, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1622.48s)]
*  and the first stop is overthrowing Saddam Hussein, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1624.68s)]
*  and in their own words, they wrote, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1627.12s)]
*  but we probably can't get public support for that [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1628.8s)]
*  short of another Pearl Harbor type of event. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1631.44s)]
*  And then after 9-11, they went, got it. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1634.64s)]
*  And then like a million people got killed in Iraq, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1639.0400000000002s)]
*  like just that alone. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1640.96s)]
*  If you just look at that, you're like, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1642.3600000000001s)]
*  yo, this is like so evil. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1643.92s)]
*  So it's very easy to flip out over that stuff. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1646.44s)]
*  I think, at least at this point in my life, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1649.68s)]
*  having a wife and little kids helps a lot. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1651.48s)]
*  It just kind of focuses me on like, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1654.0s)]
*  that's my actual life. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1655.4s)]
*  This is just the stuff I'm interested in talking about. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1657.68s)]
*  I can see if you don't have that, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1659.96s)]
*  you could completely drown yourself in this information [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1661.24s)]
*  because it's never ending. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1663.52s)]
*  I think being a comedian before that also really helped. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1664.92s)]
*  There was just like this light and fun thing. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1668.8s)]
*  You're gonna see the levity in this. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1670.84s)]
*  Yeah, right, you're always kind of gonna be like, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1672.36s)]
*  okay, well, can I turn this into a joke? [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1674.4799999999998s)]
*  Or at least, even if not, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1677.1999999999998s)]
*  even if I couldn't turn it into a joke, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1678.2399999999998s)]
*  tonight I'm gonna be at a nightclub with all my friends [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1679.7199999999998s)]
*  who happen to be hilarious people. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1682.36s)]
*  We're all gonna be laughing, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1684.4399999999998s)]
*  and we're all gonna be working on our sets. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1685.6799999999998s)]
*  That kind of kept me grounded. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1687.1599999999999s)]
*  And then also, whatever my own insecurity is, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1688.3999999999999s)]
*  I just, I have an obsessive need to not get it wrong. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1693.5600000000002s)]
*  And so I'm constantly guarding myself off like, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1699.72s)]
*  okay, I'm not gonna just fall over the deep end here [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1702.0s)]
*  and just believe some nonsense that's not true [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1704.8000000000002s)]
*  just because it kind of suits my narrative. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1707.5600000000002s)]
*  I mean, I naturally guard against that, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1709.68s)]
*  but I've seen a lot of people who don't guard against that. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1712.2800000000002s)]
*  And it gets bad quick. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1715.76s)]
*  And that's where the rabbit hole is probably. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1717.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm curious, you say the government's so evil. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1719.68s)]
*  I haven't heard you say one good thing. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1722.56s)]
*  Is there anything good that the government's doing? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1724.84s)]
*  They're really good at being evil. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1726.6s)]
*  They do a great job. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1728.1599999999999s)]
*  I said the thing about the Nazis, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1730.8s)]
*  what they did with the Jews, put up incredible numbers. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1732.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1734.8799999999999s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1736.72s)]
*  Shout out to them. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1737.56s)]
*  Do you think there's nothing [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1738.3799999999999s)]
*  that the government is doing that's good? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1739.22s)]
*  Oh, no, I mean. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1740.8799999999999s)]
*  They're well-intentioned. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1741.8799999999999s)]
*  Are there well-intentioned people in government? [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1742.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1744.36s)]
*  No, I think there are well-intentioned people in government. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1745.6s)]
*  And I think that. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1747.84s)]
*  And they get shot in the head all the time. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1748.6599999999999s)]
*  But like, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1749.5s)]
*  if they're too well-intentioned, they don't know too much. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1751.1799999999998s)]
*  But it's like, I don't know, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1753.6999999999998s)]
*  of course there's things they do that are good, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1756.78s)]
*  but in the same sense that there could be like, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1758.4199999999998s)]
*  a serial killer could still do something [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1760.02s)]
*  that's good in his life. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1761.98s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1764.1799999999998s)]
*  Like, a serial killer at some point, they might be like, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1765.02s)]
*  will you donate another dollar for children [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1767.02s)]
*  who need so-and-so? [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1769.06s)]
*  He's like, okay. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1770.06s)]
*  And it's like, I think that the instrument itself [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1770.8999999999999s)]
*  is kind of evil. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1774.5s)]
*  So the. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1775.6999999999998s)]
*  So anybody who plays it [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1776.8999999999999s)]
*  is just gonna be complicit with the evil. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1778.1s)]
*  You're gonna get caught up in that. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1780.62s)]
*  It's like a system you can't. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1782.1s)]
*  But in the same, I look at the government [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1783.74s)]
*  as like a criminal organization, morally speaking. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1786.06s)]
*  So in the same sense, if you were to ask me like, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1788.82s)]
*  has a mob family ever done anything good? [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1790.78s)]
*  Like yeah, I'm sure. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1793.8999999999999s)]
*  I'm sure they have. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1794.74s)]
*  I'm sure they were. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1795.58s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1796.4199999999998s)]
*  Right, and I'm sure they did. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1797.26s)]
*  Even that guy, like in any of those gangster movies [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1798.08s)]
*  you watch, I'm sure there was a time [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1801.0s)]
*  when some guy was beating up his wife [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1802.26s)]
*  and they went and tossed that guy a beating [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1804.4199999999998s)]
*  or something like that. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1806.34s)]
*  Like yeah, there's some good things they do. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1807.1799999999998s)]
*  Sure. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1808.74s)]
*  Sorry, go ahead. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1810.34s)]
*  I was just gonna ask, is that American government [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1811.1799999999998s)]
*  or is that like capital G, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1812.74s)]
*  the institution of government itself? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1813.9399999999998s)]
*  The institution everywhere. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1815.9399999999998s)]
*  It's all. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1817.6999999999998s)]
*  I think the, sorry, I think the illusion that we have [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1818.54s)]
*  is that every other country's government [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1822.1s)]
*  is corrupt except ours, right? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1824.4199999999998s)]
*  Like that's kind of how like Americans go into it. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1826.9399999999998s)]
*  Maybe black Americans are a little bit more [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1829.06s)]
*  distrusting of the government. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1832.06s)]
*  But once you find out that there are [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1833.8999999999999s)]
*  these government institutions [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1835.74s)]
*  or just like corporate entities in general [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1836.8999999999999s)]
*  that are operating with like high level [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1839.94s)]
*  collusion and corruption, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1841.02s)]
*  it's kind of a staggering moment. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1843.02s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1846.8999999999999s)]
*  But what's even crazier to me [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1847.78s)]
*  is that people who are kind of like [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1850.26s)]
*  on to the government corruption [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1851.8799999999999s)]
*  and start realizing how corrupt this whole system is, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1853.98s)]
*  still if there's a conflict between us and Russia, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1856.3s)]
*  they kind of snap back to their like, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1859.22s)]
*  no matter how corrupt they see our government as being, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1861.94s)]
*  they could still never see it like Russia. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1864.34s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1866.46s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1867.3s)]
*  It's amazing, particularly with the war, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1868.14s)]
*  since the war in Ukraine broke out, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1870.5400000000002s)]
*  how many people in the US will just be like, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1873.26s)]
*  we can't stand for someone invading a sovereign country. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1876.66s)]
*  And you're like, you are familiar with very recent history. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1880.9s)]
*  Like I'm not saying like 80 years ago [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1887.0200000000002s)]
*  we did something like this. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1888.66s)]
*  I'm saying we're still there. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1889.66s)]
*  We still have troops in Iraq right now. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1892.5400000000002s)]
*  We still have troops in Syria right now. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1894.5s)]
*  Is it like, what world are you living in that like, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1896.5s)]
*  the vehicle we have is our government. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1900.54s)]
*  So what you think that's DC's motive [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1902.98s)]
*  is that they're just like, we just can't stand by [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1905.18s)]
*  while someone invades another country. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1907.74s)]
*  Isn't it? [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1909.54s)]
*  So what is your solution? [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1910.38s)]
*  Well, I mean, like ultimately the solution would be [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1912.3400000000001s)]
*  for a government to stop doing a lot of the evil stuff [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1915.8600000000001s)]
*  that they're doing. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1918.42s)]
*  But how do we get that? [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1919.26s)]
*  I mean, look, I'm asking you as like someone [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1920.1000000000001s)]
*  I consider a leader in this idea, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1922.18s)]
*  what would your solution be? [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1923.98s)]
*  I'm not like to under do gotcha. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1925.38s)]
*  Well, we're already in trouble if I'm the leader. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1926.5800000000002s)]
*  But I think that propaganda is incredibly powerful [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1929.14s)]
*  like as I was saying before. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1936.1000000000001s)]
*  And I think the fact that like, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1937.3400000000001s)]
*  there's so many like shows with huge audiences now [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1938.9s)]
*  that can kind of like shine a light on all this stuff. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1942.8200000000002s)]
*  I think that's really powerful. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1945.38s)]
*  So in short, I think like telling the truth [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1946.94s)]
*  is very, very powerful. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1949.14s)]
*  And then in terms of what would actually roll back [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1951.1000000000001s)]
*  kind of government corruption, I don't know. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1954.22s)]
*  I mean, I think there's something going on. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1957.78s)]
*  We have not figured it out yet. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1962.02s)]
*  But I'm not saying anything positive [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1963.54s)]
*  about how Donald Trump actually governed. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1966.18s)]
*  But the fact that there was so much hunger [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1968.3400000000001s)]
*  for a Donald Trump like figure, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1970.14s)]
*  I think shows something of people waking up. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1971.74s)]
*  I think- [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1973.94s)]
*  Even Bernie too. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1974.78s)]
*  Bernie, Bobby Kennedy, like all these guys. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1975.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm not just saying this because I'm Indian, Vivek. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1978.3400000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah, 100%, Vivek Ramaswamy is like- [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1980.54s)]
*  I mean, he took a very hard line on government corruption. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1982.98s)]
*  I mean, when he was on the pot, he was zip. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1986.6200000000001s)]
*  I was like, what if this corruption benefits us [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1988.18s)]
*  in certain ways? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1992.18s)]
*  Like hypothetically, what if these government policies, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1993.22s)]
*  this interventionism that we're doing benefits us [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1996.5s)]
*  and gives us a better lifestyle? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=1999.54s)]
*  Would you, if you found that out, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2001.34s)]
*  would you still wanna go through it? [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2003.38s)]
*  And if would you still wanna go through it [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2004.78s)]
*  if it meant getting rid of the managerial class? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2007.46s)]
*  That's what he talks about. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2009.5s)]
*  I'm sure you've heard the term. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2010.5s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2011.34s)]
*  He goes, the people deserve a government [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2012.8200000000002s)]
*  that represents them for better or worse. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2017.0600000000002s)]
*  So he's like, I will take a shittier America [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2019.46s)]
*  or higher price for food or higher price for medication, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2023.38s)]
*  whatever it is, if we're actually making the decisions. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2026.7s)]
*  Or there are people representing our decisions. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2031.22s)]
*  Yeah, how would you answer that? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2033.02s)]
*  Well, I think that, so I'd say that I think [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2034.18s)]
*  if there's one like kind of universal truth [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2037.48s)]
*  that I've found in my life is that like lying [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2040.68s)]
*  to yourself is destructive. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2042.96s)]
*  I think it's worse than lying to other people. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2045.48s)]
*  And lying to other people is bad too, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2047.24s)]
*  but lying to yourself is like the most powerful, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2048.78s)]
*  destructive thing you can do. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2051.28s)]
*  And so if it were the case that us going in, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2052.6800000000003s)]
*  mass slaughtering a bunch of people in Iraq and Libya [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2057.28s)]
*  and Afghanistan and Syria and Yemen and Somalia [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2061.0s)]
*  and all these places, that gave us a higher standard [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2063.92s)]
*  of living, then let's look ourselves in the mirror [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2067.28s)]
*  and have that honest conversation. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2069.48s)]
*  Is that who we are? [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2070.96s)]
*  Do we, is the role of the United States of America [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2072.28s)]
*  that we are the world empire and we're going around [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2074.86s)]
*  to take your shit and give it to us? [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2077.88s)]
*  And if you wanna have that honest conversation [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2080.48s)]
*  with yourself and then conclude, yes, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2082.2400000000002s)]
*  that's what we're gonna do, then at least [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2084.2400000000002s)]
*  have that honest conversation. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2085.92s)]
*  Don't sit here and pretend. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2087.44s)]
*  I've had that conversation, this is why no shit. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2088.6s)]
*  I've been like, yeah, all right. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2090.96s)]
*  My life is much better. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2094.16s)]
*  So either I can leave or I can just accept [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2096.28s)]
*  this is what it is and I ain't leaving. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2100.6400000000003s)]
*  Well, fair enough. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2102.38s)]
*  Unless there's another empire coming [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2103.2200000000003s)]
*  and I'm jumping ship. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2104.7200000000003s)]
*  That's the first step would be to ask that question. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2105.5600000000004s)]
*  But I don't, I just don't believe that it's true. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2108.7200000000003s)]
*  I think that it has made, there's special interests [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2111.82s)]
*  that have benefited tremendously off of all of those wars. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2118.0800000000004s)]
*  But I don't know, I mean, I'm looking around the country, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2121.46s)]
*  it's like, no, I don't think this has been good [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2124.1800000000003s)]
*  for not only our economy but just like our soul. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2126.88s)]
*  I don't think it's, I know it's a Biden thing, [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2129.7999999999997s)]
*  he said the soul of the nation or whatever. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2131.7599999999998s)]
*  But there's something to that. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2133.4s)]
*  You want people to be proud of the country they're living in. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2135.48s)]
*  I think an American pride right now is at an all time low [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2137.48s)]
*  and you gotta give them something to be proud of. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2140.08s)]
*  I actually thought a lot about this. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2142.2799999999997s)]
*  Like a friend of mine, I gotta give him credit, Ben Uyeda. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2143.6s)]
*  I was like, why are you proud to be American? [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2146.52s)]
*  And he's like, I think you can be the best version [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2149.6s)]
*  of yourself here. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2152.7s)]
*  And I thought that that was, that to me was, is America [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2154.04s)]
*  and something you still can be represented by. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2160.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2163.44s)]
*  And like, but it was important. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2164.2799999999997s)]
*  I think it was like July 4th and we were thinking [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2165.96s)]
*  about like doing a piece on it. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2167.7599999999998s)]
*  And it was like, yeah, why should we? [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2168.88s)]
*  I think we have to bolster some American sentiment. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2169.96s)]
*  This is a great country, this is amazing. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2172.56s)]
*  There's all these opportunities. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2174.24s)]
*  We get to be fucking comedians running around talking shit. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2175.08s)]
*  We actually get to provide for our families. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2177.2599999999998s)]
*  But he brought that up and he's like, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2179.72s)]
*  yeah, we can be the best version of ourselves here. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2182.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think that's always been the best thing [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2185.5600000000004s)]
*  about America is that you could kind of be the author [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2188.2200000000003s)]
*  of your own story and you can kind of like, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2190.6400000000003s)]
*  it's never been perfect, never will be perfect. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2193.4s)]
*  But it's like, yeah, you could like make something [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2195.52s)]
*  of yourself and I think we very much take it for granted. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2197.48s)]
*  It has not been true in most of the world [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2201.5800000000004s)]
*  for most of human history that you could like come [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2204.0s)]
*  from something kind of humble and make something [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2207.1600000000003s)]
*  really cool of yourself here. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2209.4s)]
*  And that's awesome. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2210.88s)]
*  But in terms of like the war stuff [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2212.0s)]
*  and dominating the rest of the world, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2214.94s)]
*  I just, I don't see any evidence that that's connected to, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2216.76s)]
*  like that the two are connected. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2221.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean, look, even after we get hit on 9-11, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2222.32s)]
*  we launched the war on terrorism in late 2001, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2225.8s)]

*  Shoot, if you're gonna bet on the presidential election, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2266.28s)]
*  Stake has got your back. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2268.52s)]
*  You go there, you make it happen. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2269.84s)]
*  They are the official partner of the flagrant podcast. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2271.68s)]
*  We are happy to have them. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2275.16s)]
*  Now let's get back to the show. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2276.6s)]
*  Do you think there's ever, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2277.56s)]
*  like we hear about this term like global police and stuff. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2278.68s)]
*  Do you think that since World War II, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2280.72s)]
*  there's been any foreign intervention [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2282.12s)]
*  that's been generally positive or moral? [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2284.8s)]
*  No. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2287.72s)]
*  Great question. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2288.56s)]
*  From the United States of America? [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2289.4s)]
*  No. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2290.7599999999998s)]
*  Korea, anything like that? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2291.6s)]
*  No, no. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2292.42s)]
*  I mean, it's a disaster in Korea. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2293.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, this awful bloody war ended in a stalemate [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2295.6s)]
*  and North Koreans have been prisoners ever since. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2298.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's just, Vietnam was just, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2300.72s)]
*  I mean, horrific obviously. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2303.48s)]
*  I think even like Clinton's intervention [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2305.24s)]
*  in Serbia was horrible. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2307.9199999999996s)]
*  There's, you know, yeah, well, it didn't go well. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2310.68s)]
*  Vladimir Putin knows he was pretty pissed about that. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2313.8799999999997s)]
*  But, and then of course, all the terror wars have just been, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2316.24s)]
*  I mean, just wrecked the Middle East [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2320.12s)]
*  and spent trillions of dollars [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2321.9199999999996s)]
*  on slaughtering hundreds of thousands of people. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2324.68s)]
*  So no, I don't think so. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2326.96s)]
*  And it was like, you know, that was, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2329.2400000000002s)]
*  America was never really supposed to be [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2330.88s)]
*  the policeman of the world. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2332.2200000000003s)]
*  That's a fairly new thing. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2333.28s)]
*  And it doesn't make sense. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2334.96s)]
*  It's like, you can't, the whole thing about America [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2336.02s)]
*  is we're supposed to be like [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2338.8s)]
*  a constitutionally limited republic. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2339.66s)]
*  The idea is people are free here, with some exceptions. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2341.68s)]
*  We got around to it eventually. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2345.12s)]
*  But it's, I'm not saying we were perfect. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2347.52s)]
*  But, but no, the idea, I mean, come on, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2351.52s)]
*  it's just like so obvious. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2355.16s)]
*  It's like, come on, you can't have that much power [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2356.12s)]
*  and not be corrupting. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2358.12s)]
*  You're telling me you're, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2359.2799999999997s)]
*  this is what the neocons also, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2360.2799999999997s)]
*  those same ones in a project for a new American century, [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2361.48s)]
*  or actually, now it wasn't a project [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2363.88s)]
*  for a new American century, but it was two of the guys. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2365.16s)]
*  It was Bill Kristol and Robert Kagan. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2367.12s)]
*  And they wrote in, the piece is called [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2369.56s)]
*  Toward a Neo-Reaganite Foreign Policy. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2372.36s)]
*  It was in the Weekly Standard, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2375.62s)]
*  or it was in Foreign Affairs, actually, I think. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2377.44s)]
*  And they wrote, that was what they were suggesting. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2380.04s)]
*  It was after the fall of the Soviet Union. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2382.64s)]
*  And they said America has to be the benevolent hegemon. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2384.6s)]
*  What's a hegemon? [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2391.08s)]
*  You know, it basically means empire. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2391.92s)]
*  It means controlling everything. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2395.0s)]
*  So it was, but the good empire, you know? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2396.8399999999997s)]
*  We rule the world, but we're the good guys. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2399.12s)]
*  Yeah, all right. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2401.0s)]
*  Is it really as simple as there are a few companies [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2402.0s)]
*  that benefit in a dramatic fashion [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2406.8399999999997s)]
*  by creating wars around the world? [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2410.48s)]
*  Is it that simple? [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2413.6s)]
*  No, I think there's more to it. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2415.12s)]
*  That is definitely true. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2416.9599999999996s)]
*  That's just a fact. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2418.72s)]
*  But are they sitting in a boardroom going, [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2420.4399999999996s)]
*  okay, let's invent some more. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2421.64s)]
*  It's because we got some bombs to sell. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2422.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, I think that there are, there's ideologues in there too, [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2424.9599999999996s)]
*  and they all kind of weirdly meet up. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2429.04s)]
*  And so, if you have, part of the reason [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2431.66s)]
*  that neoconservatives just totally hijacked [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2434.68s)]
*  American foreign policy is that their agenda [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2437.22s)]
*  was that we should be fighting. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2440.72s)]
*  Look, they were saying back in the 90s [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2442.28s)]
*  that when there was this big kind of turning point, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2444.6400000000003s)]
*  which I think is really underappreciated [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2446.88s)]
*  by people around our age, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2448.48s)]
*  because we were kind of kids in the 90s, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2450.36s)]
*  and you're kind of like, oh, I just remember that [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2452.2000000000003s)]
*  as being a time when America was more America, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2454.2000000000003s)]
*  and now everything's kind of crazy. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2456.6000000000004s)]
*  Back then, it was more what we, like, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2457.96s)]
*  was simple to understand. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2459.5600000000004s)]
*  But what happened in 1991 is the Soviet Union collapsed. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2461.0800000000004s)]
*  And for the first time in human history, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2465.0800000000004s)]
*  there was a true unipolar superpower. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2467.48s)]
*  Like, there's really never been anything like that [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2470.28s)]
*  before. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2472.88s)]
*  It was just the United States of America. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2473.72s)]
*  And there was this big debate [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2475.04s)]
*  about what we're supposed to do now. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2476.56s)]
*  Like, and basically, the Soviet Union had been used [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2478.4s)]
*  as the excuse for the military industrial complex. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2481.68s)]
*  Military industrial complex. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2484.7599999999998s)]
*  It falls, now there's no excuse. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2486.16s)]
*  They have to create one. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2487.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2488.92s)]
*  Dave! [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2489.7599999999998s)]
*  So this is the whole thing. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2490.58s)]
*  Can you just say that one more time [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2491.42s)]
*  so people understand? [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2493.36s)]
*  This is really interesting. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2494.2s)]
*  So just to rewind a little bit, right? [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2496.48s)]
*  Understand, there was not really [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2499.1s)]
*  a military industrial complex until World War II. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2501.98s)]
*  World War II was when it was created. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2504.86s)]
*  This is Eisenhower, Eisenhower was the five-star general [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2506.9s)]
*  who led us to victory in World War II. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2510.42s)]
*  And then later said, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2511.82s)]
*  And when he was president, he goes, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2512.66s)]
*  listen, that was his farewell address. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2513.9s)]
*  Listen, we've created this military industrial complex. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2515.42s)]
*  We've built up these great big weapons companies. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2517.94s)]
*  And he was basically saying, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2520.14s)]
*  there's a business of war now. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2521.22s)]
*  And it's big business. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2523.3s)]
*  This is, yeah. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2524.7s)]
*  And so they want, so now, the, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2525.54s)]
*  Real quick, real quick. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2526.38s)]
*  This is so important. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2527.22s)]
*  Just to make sure everybody understands it. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2528.2s)]
*  Just the term military industrial complex, [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2529.52s)]
*  can you just briefly say basically what that means, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2531.44s)]
*  who you're talking about, and then we get right to it. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2533.96s)]
*  Well, just basically that there's a big business of war now. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2535.36s)]
*  There are these huge manufacturing arms companies [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2538.5s)]
*  that are in the business of selling weapons [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2541.68s)]
*  to the government. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2544.22s)]
*  So they. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2545.16s)]
*  And there's big business here. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2546.0s)]
*  And they're heavily incentivized to get more business. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2547.2s)]
*  But the way they get more business isn't like you or me. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2551.44s)]
*  It's not like we gotta get more people [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2554.3s)]
*  to come to our shows or something like that. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2555.88s)]
*  It's like they gotta get more politicians [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2558.92s)]
*  to sign off on wars so that they use the weapons [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2560.0s)]
*  they just sold them and need to buy more weapons [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2562.8s)]
*  from them for the next thing. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2564.8s)]
*  So now William F. Buckley, who was probably. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2566.08s)]
*  Sorry to interrupt one more time. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2569.48s)]
*  Was Eisenhower's point, we need to be wary of this? [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2570.32s)]
*  Or was he like, okay. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2572.66s)]
*  No, he was like, we need to guard against them [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2573.68s)]
*  trying to get more power. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2576.76s)]
*  And this is five star general. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2579.0s)]
*  Dwight D. Eisenhower sang it. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2580.56s)]
*  The country needed to create one to win World War II. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2582.24s)]
*  Yes, well, to win the war, yes. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2585.44s)]
*  We probably needed to do that. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2587.28s)]
*  Because everybody got on board. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2588.88s)]
*  But we didn't necessarily. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2589.96s)]
*  Ford was making tanks and shit. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2590.8s)]
*  It became. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2592.32s)]
*  Yes, but then we created right after World War II, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2593.1600000000003s)]
*  we created the CIA, which was in the beginning [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2596.2400000000002s)]
*  supposed to be like a newspaper for the president. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2599.4s)]
*  Like a secret newspaper. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2603.8s)]
*  It's like, listen, we need to know [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2605.28s)]
*  what's going on around the world. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2606.2400000000002s)]
*  So you come and give the president all the intelligence [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2607.9s)]
*  of what's really going on. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2610.32s)]
*  And then it very quickly turned into [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2611.52s)]
*  a paramilitary secret kind of black ops thing. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2613.72s)]
*  No offense. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2618.3999999999996s)]
*  But. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2619.24s)]
*  Okay, so this gets, now Bill Buckley, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2624.7599999999998s)]
*  who was really the most kind of influential [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2626.8399999999997s)]
*  conservative figure in the second half [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2629.9199999999996s)]
*  of the 20th century. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2632.08s)]
*  He wrote this big piece about it [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2633.08s)]
*  where he was basically like, in converting the old right [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2634.7599999999998s)]
*  into the new Cold Warriors, he was like, listen, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2637.24s)]
*  we are supposed to just be like a city on a hill, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2639.9199999999996s)]
*  limited government, traditional conservative thing. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2642.44s)]
*  But here's the thing, is we got the Soviet Union. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2645.6s)]
*  So at the end of World War II, the two big winners [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2648.68s)]
*  are America and the Soviet Union. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2651.2000000000003s)]
*  And they're communist. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2653.0s)]
*  And they were explicitly for world domination. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2654.08s)]
*  Like they wanted to spread communism across the world. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2656.92s)]
*  And so then there's this thing like, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2659.64s)]
*  we have to be in this battle with them. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2660.76s)]
*  We gotta fight a war in Korea. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2662.36s)]
*  We gotta fight a war in Vietnam. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2663.6s)]
*  We have to, so then in 1991, they collapse. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2664.8s)]
*  They just throw in the towel. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2668.88s)]
*  Nobody saw it coming on our side of intelligence. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2670.84s)]
*  Like the CIA didn't see this coming. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2674.32s)]
*  They thought they were gonna be around for a while. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2675.92s)]
*  I thought it was a slow decay [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2677.44s)]
*  and it was just kind of like an emerald. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2678.6s)]
*  Well it was, but they didn't really perceive it. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2679.44s)]
*  So George H.W. Bush at the time, [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2682.2000000000003s)]
*  he went over and gave what's called [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2684.92s)]
*  his chicken Kiev speech, where he was trying [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2686.32s)]
*  to keep the Soviet Union together. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2689.1600000000003s)]
*  Like they didn't want them to collapse. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2690.84s)]
*  They were, and maybe- [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2692.6800000000003s)]
*  Cause you'd meet the boogeyman or? [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2693.76s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2695.32s)]
*  I mean, partly, I'm sure that's part of it. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2696.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm sure also they were just like a little concerned [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2699.2799999999997s)]
*  about like what replaces this. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2701.24s)]
*  You guys got a lot of nuclear weapons. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2702.9199999999996s)]
*  Like what's next, you know? [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2704.24s)]
*  Enemy who knows better than the enemy. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2706.2s)]
*  Right, I'm sure there's some of that too. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2707.4799999999996s)]
*  But anyway, as this thing falls in the 90s, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2709.4399999999996s)]
*  there's a lot of debate over like, [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2711.7599999999998s)]
*  so what are we supposed to do now? [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2713.4399999999996s)]
*  And a lot of conservatives and liberals were like, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2715.2799999999997s)]
*  oh, we can go back to being a normal country now. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2719.64s)]
*  Like we don't have to dominate the world. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2721.9599999999996s)]
*  We can go back to like, we could have a peace dividend. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2723.9199999999996s)]
*  We can save money on all this stuff. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2726.3199999999997s)]
*  So the neocons come in and they go, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2728.96s)]
*  they go, no, no, no, no. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2733.04s)]
*  This is what Charles Crattenhammer called [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2734.3199999999997s)]
*  the unipolar moment. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2736.08s)]
*  And he was like, look, we have a moment right now [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2737.88s)]
*  that we can remake the world and no one can stop us. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2740.12s)]
*  No one's got the power. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2744.04s)]
*  It used to be kind of like, well, [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2744.92s)]
*  could we get away with doing this over here? [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2746.3199999999997s)]
*  The Soviet Union might try to stop us. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2747.68s)]
*  Or can we impose our will on Vietnam [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2749.36s)]
*  versus can the commies impose their will on Vietnam? [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2752.36s)]
*  But he goes, now there's no one like that. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2756.24s)]
*  We can go do whatever we wanna do. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2757.92s)]
*  And the neocons advocated huge increases [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2759.92s)]
*  in the military budget. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2763.56s)]
*  Even though the Soviet Union just fell, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2764.56s)]
*  we're supposed to be pulling back on this. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2766.16s)]
*  They haven't got huge increases. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2767.96s)]
*  And then of course, all of their think tanks [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2769.08s)]
*  got huge donations from weapons companies. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2772.16s)]
*  So it's not- [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2774.88s)]
*  So now they get to thinking. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2775.7200000000003s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2776.56s)]
*  Right, you know? [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2777.4s)]
*  So like, is it one thing? [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2778.4s)]
*  Is it as simple as there's this business who has this? [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2780.04s)]
*  It's like, no, there are like these people [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2782.4s)]
*  who I think do have these beliefs. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2784.56s)]
*  If those beliefs happen to be weapons companies [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2787.4s)]
*  should make a ton more money, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2790.56s)]
*  the defense budget should be increased by $200 billion, [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2791.88s)]
*  a whole lot of weapons companies are like, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2795.4s)]
*  I like that young man. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2797.12s)]
*  I think he's got some important ideas. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2798.24s)]
*  And so then the system kind of perpetuates itself. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2800.64s)]
*  And then, go, go. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2804.0s)]
*  There's no fix to stop that though. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2804.84s)]
*  Even if you get the truth out there to everyone, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2807.08s)]
*  just like Akash's honest answer, we're not going anywhere. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2809.88s)]
*  Well, I mean, like yes and no. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2814.16s)]
*  Why would they ever stop? [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2815.76s)]
*  Because nothing lasts forever. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2817.6s)]
*  I mean, look, the Soviet Union, why did they ever stop? [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2819.3199999999997s)]
*  It was eventually they just kind of realized [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2821.88s)]
*  that the jig was up and the people were onto them [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2823.7599999999998s)]
*  and they didn't want to be a part of it anymore. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2826.3199999999997s)]
*  And they were like, I guess we could force them all to stay. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2828.3199999999997s)]
*  We could go put down these revolts, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2831.56s)]
*  but there just wasn't the will anymore. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2833.68s)]
*  And I weirdly do see America getting closer [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2837.12s)]
*  to that position where like at a certain point, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2839.92s)]
*  the evil people in Washington, D.C., [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2843.16s)]
*  maybe they would be like, you know what? [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2844.8399999999997s)]
*  National Guard, go put down this movement. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2847.28s)]
*  And then the National Guard, they're like, [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2848.96s)]
*  they don't even really believe in this thing anymore either. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2850.28s)]
*  They're like, it's kind of wrong what you're doing. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2852.4s)]
*  But then they just throw a trance in your algorithm [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2854.12s)]
*  and now we're not caring about it. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2856.28s)]
*  Well, that worked for about a decade so far. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2858.12s)]
*  So yeah, that's one way to play it. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2860.0s)]
*  No, look, I'm not saying like who's gonna win this or not, [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2863.08s)]
*  but I don't think it's, look, what is crazy right now [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2866.84s)]
*  is that like, if you think about even the COVID, [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2870.08s)]
*  there was a, I'm trying to remember [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2873.4s)]
*  exactly what time this was. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2875.08s)]
*  There was like, they came out, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2876.6s)]
*  I remember saying this to Rogan one time [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2878.68s)]
*  in the green room at the mothership, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2883.08s)]
*  where I was just like, did you know how crazy this is? [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2885.04s)]
*  That they were like floating out the idea [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2887.2s)]
*  of doing another round of lockdowns. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2889.7999999999997s)]
*  It was like right at the end of like the Omicron variant [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2891.84s)]
*  or something like that. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2895.3199999999997s)]
*  And you know how they do these things? [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2896.48s)]
*  They put trial balloons out there. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2898.04s)]
*  They go, we're thinking about having a national vaccine, [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2899.88s)]
*  go passport, database, and then like people get furious [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2903.68s)]
*  and then they go, no, no, no, no, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2906.2799999999997s)]
*  we were never gonna do that anyway. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2907.24s)]
*  You know, they're always testing like [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2908.4s)]
*  what they can get away with. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2909.2799999999997s)]
*  And they floated out lockdowns again. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2910.3599999999997s)]
*  And it was just like for three days on Twitter, [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2912.4s)]
*  everybody was like, I will burn this place to the ground [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2914.16s)]
*  if you try to do lockdowns again. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2917.4s)]
*  I was like, that's not happening. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2918.64s)]
*  And I said to Joe, I was like, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2919.8799999999997s)]
*  you might be the reason why [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2922.24s)]
*  we're not having lockdowns again. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2924.24s)]
*  Like you may have just changed the course of the, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2926.56s)]
*  like if it was all just corporate media [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2929.8399999999997s)]
*  and you hadn't like broken that paradigm, [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2932.8399999999997s)]
*  they may, I don't know for sure, [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2935.3599999999997s)]
*  but like they may have been able [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2937.12s)]
*  to get away with this again. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2938.3599999999997s)]
*  And so stuff like that is like, [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2939.7599999999998s)]
*  I actually think there's a lot of that going on [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2941.8399999999997s)]
*  where there's things that, you know, [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2944.12s)]
*  it's like you can't see the counterfactual. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2945.44s)]
*  There's something voices that are not under their control. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2946.2799999999997s)]
*  And what could they have gotten away with [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2949.12s)]
*  if they didn't have that? [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2950.52s)]
*  Exactly, so we're just comparing it to what exists, [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2951.3599999999997s)]
*  not what it could have been without, [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2953.7599999999998s)]
*  I guess these like free voices. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2956.2s)]
*  Does that reach globally you think? [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2959.24s)]
*  Did they impose that anywhere else? [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2961.56s)]
*  Like a late stage Omicron lockdown or whatever? [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2962.92s)]
*  You know, I do think, I don't, you know, I don't know. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2965.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2968.2799999999997s)]
*  Didn't China have a second lockdown? [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2969.12s)]
*  Yeah, China had a few lockdowns there. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2971.12s)]
*  I mean, they can do whatever they want. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2973.48s)]
*  But you know- [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2975.12s)]
*  What would be the benefit of another lockdown? [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2977.48s)]
*  Well- [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2980.04s)]
*  Like who profits off that? [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2980.88s)]
*  Oh, it was really good for big business, man. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2982.24s)]
*  Lockdowns were great for big business [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2984.12s)]
*  because it totally, it killed all the small [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2985.88s)]
*  and mid-sized businesses. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2988.36s)]
*  Put their competition out. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2989.92s)]
*  And then everyone's ordering from Amazon. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2991.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2993.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean, it's all like, it was very good. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2994.04s)]
*  It's a big wealth transfer, like those couple years. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2995.92s)]
*  And then for all the, oh yeah, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=2998.36s)]
*  it was the largest transfer of wealth in human history. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3001.28s)]
*  That's what I had read. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3003.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, oh no, it clearly was. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3004.56s)]
*  I mean, it's just the bills that they were signing. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3006.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, they like printed like $6 trillion in 2020 [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3009.32s)]
*  and handed it out. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3012.6400000000003s)]
*  You know, I don't know, like American people [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3013.6s)]
*  got like 1200 bucks and then the rest went to corporations. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3015.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3018.48s)]
*  You hear a lot of buzzwords [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3019.56s)]
*  in these types of conversations. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3022.28s)]
*  Companies like BlackRock is always brought up. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3024.52s)]
*  Why is BlackRock evil? [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3027.56s)]
*  They don't seem good. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3030.6400000000003s)]
*  And why not? [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3031.96s)]
*  Like you'll hear these, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3033.8s)]
*  they're buying all the single-family homes. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3034.6400000000003s)]
*  Okay, they're not allowed to do that. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3037.04s)]
*  Are they a hedge fund? [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3038.96s)]
*  They're allowed to buy all the wheat. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3039.84s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3041.84s)]
*  But like why are they specifically bad [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3042.6800000000003s)]
*  and why are they worse than another hedge fund? [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3045.0s)]
*  Well, I think it's as simple as that they're the biggest. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3047.28s)]
*  They're the best. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3051.5600000000004s)]
*  Or it's them and a few others. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3052.4s)]
*  And it's just, you just see kind of like this thing [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3055.1600000000003s)]
*  being consolidated into like just what it's like Vanguard [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3056.92s)]
*  and there's like a couple really big ones. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3060.7200000000003s)]
*  But it's also just that they're like in these like crazy [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3063.76s)]
*  corrupt partnerships. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3067.0800000000004s)]
*  Like it's not, you know, it's like if a company [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3068.6000000000004s)]
*  gets really big organically, like just in the market, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3070.76s)]
*  I mean, it's like you rarely see people angry about that. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3074.1600000000003s)]
*  But like Nvidia is a good example. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3077.56s)]
*  Well, it's anything where it's voluntary. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3078.4s)]
*  It's just kind of like, I don't know, [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3081.28s)]
*  that's what people are choosing to go to. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3083.48s)]
*  They're choosing to get their products from there [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3085.08s)]
*  because they like the product or whatever. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3087.36s)]
*  Like, you know, it's, but when you're getting say big [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3089.4s)]
*  because you're getting like all the government contracts [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3093.04s)]
*  or for example, like with some of these big companies where, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3096.48s)]
*  and by the way, Vivek Ramaswamy wrote about this [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3099.8s)]
*  in his book, really interesting. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3101.88s)]
*  One of his books, Woking, I think. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3104.6s)]
*  But where it's like they'll have these like [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3107.16s)]
*  state pension funds. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3110.0s)]
*  So they have the pensions for all, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3112.2799999999997s)]
*  every government employee in like California say. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3114.92s)]
*  So they've got like just billions and billions of dollars [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3117.7599999999998s)]
*  because you know, the only people who have good pensions [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3120.96s)]
*  are government workers anymore. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3122.56s)]
*  And so they get to choose where they're gonna invest [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3124.0s)]
*  that money and they'll be like, oh, okay, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3125.72s)]
*  we'll invest it in these companies. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3127.48s)]
*  But only if you meet certain DEI standards. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3129.6s)]
*  Or only, you know what I mean? [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3134.72s)]
*  So it's like. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3136.04s)]
*  So it's like. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3136.88s)]
*  They impose their will on the companies. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3137.72s)]
*  Yes, they kind of impose their own cultural agenda [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3138.6s)]
*  through financial means, [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3142.44s)]
*  but it wasn't like a bottom up thing. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3144.36s)]
*  Like whenever it's a bottom up thing, [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3146.6s)]
*  you don't see this type of like resentment over it. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3148.24s)]
*  Like if there's like a bottom up thing, [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3150.6s)]
*  like I do think like the acceptance of like gay marriage [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3152.32s)]
*  was very much a bottom up thing. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3155.04s)]
*  Eventually people are just like not, yeah. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3156.68s)]
*  Not everyone. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3158.72s)]
*  Not everyone was cool with that. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3159.56s)]
*  It took some of us longer than others. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3161.2s)]
*  But you know what I mean? [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3163.12s)]
*  Like, but it's like, but this is different. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3164.2799999999997s)]
*  Like this stuff all being pushed is totally top down. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3166.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3169.9199999999996s)]
*  What's happening, what happened on the Twitter spaces? [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3170.7599999999998s)]
*  You popped in with Candace. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3173.12s)]
*  What was the conversation? [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3175.2s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3177.44s)]
*  What has she latched onto? [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3178.7599999999998s)]
*  What does she care? [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3179.8399999999997s)]
*  What is she trying to do? [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3180.7599999999998s)]
*  She feels that America has been taken hostage by Israel? [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3182.04s)]
*  Well, I think from what I understand, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3185.68s)]
*  it kind of started, so she was over at the Daily Wire. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3187.84s)]
*  And I do think this was, you know, like, [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3191.36s)]
*  I don't know Candace like super well, [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3195.76s)]
*  but we've like, we've done shows together [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3198.08s)]
*  and we've hung out a little bit. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3200.6800000000003s)]
*  And she seems to be very genuine to me. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3201.76s)]
*  But she, I guess, had just had a baby. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3204.7200000000003s)]
*  And she's had, I think, several kids [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3208.88s)]
*  in a short period of time. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3211.04s)]
*  Two, right? [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3211.88s)]
*  I think three. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3212.96s)]
*  But like, and so she had just given birth. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3214.7200000000003s)]
*  And the war in Gaza kicks off. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3218.4s)]
*  And she started talking on her show [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3220.48s)]
*  about like how heartbreaking the images [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3223.0s)]
*  of like all these dead kids in Gaza was. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3225.68s)]
*  And I guess because it was a Daily Wire show [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3229.08s)]
*  and the people she was around were around her and so on. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3231.2s)]
*  And people started like flipping out at her like, [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3233.84s)]
*  like, oh, Israel has to do this. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3237.04s)]
*  How dare you criticize Israel, blah, blah, blah. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3239.2s)]
*  And she was like, I'm just saying it's sad to see dead kids. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3241.08s)]
*  And when she got that kind of pushback, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3243.84s)]
*  because I think that's her personality type, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3246.64s)]
*  was she was immediately like, [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3248.84s)]
*  I'm doubling down on this now [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3250.7200000000003s)]
*  and I'm gonna really dig into this. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3252.16s)]
*  And she got more and more critical of what Israel was doing [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3254.12s)]
*  and the Israeli kind of relationship with Israel, [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3256.8s)]
*  which there's a lot to criticize there [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3260.52s)]
*  the more you look into it. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3262.56s)]
*  Our relationship with Israel? [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3263.4s)]
*  Yeah, the relationship. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3264.84s)]
*  What is our relationship? [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3265.92s)]
*  What is misunderstood about our relationship with Israel? [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3267.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, okay, so John Mearsheimer, who's like, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3269.84s)]
*  just, I mean, like just a total genius [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3274.08s)]
*  and one of like the, I think, world, [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3276.88s)]
*  the kind of leading world intellectuals [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3279.7599999999998s)]
*  on like foreign affairs. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3283.08s)]
*  The way he put it, which I think is more or less right, [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3286.16s)]
*  is that it's unlike any other relationship [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3288.64s)]
*  between any other two countries. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3292.48s)]
*  The relationship between the United States of America [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3294.36s)]
*  and the government of Israel is like, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3296.48s)]
*  they get unconditional support from us. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3298.84s)]
*  We prop them up in everything they do, [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3301.84s)]
*  no matter what they did. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3304.52s)]
*  And no matter whether we want them to do something else, [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3306.4s)]
*  whether they do exactly the opposite of what we have. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3309.88s)]
*  If we just go, hey, I know you've done these nine things, [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3312.28s)]
*  could you just not do this 10th thing? [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3314.32s)]
*  It's a real problem for us. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3316.1200000000003s)]
*  They go, no, we're doing the 10th thing [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3317.6000000000004s)]
*  and we still fund them while they do it. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3320.2400000000002s)]
*  And that's true for a lot of different reasons. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3322.04s)]
*  Why? [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3324.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, part of it is because there's a very powerful lobby [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3325.76s)]
*  in the United States of America called AIPAC. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3330.84s)]
*  What is AIPAC? [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3333.48s)]
*  AIPAC is the Israeli lobby. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3334.6800000000003s)]
*  Is that actually what it is? [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3338.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's the American-Israeli lobby. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3339.96s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3344.1600000000003s)]
*  So technically they'll say they're not a foreign lobby, [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3345.0s)]
*  they're a lobby of Americans, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3347.76s)]
*  lobby on behalf of a foreign country. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3349.96s)]
*  So it's kind of like- [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3352.44s)]
*  Are there other lobbies that are like this for Qatar? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3354.1200000000003s)]
*  Are there other lobbies that are like this for Saudi Arabia? [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3356.4s)]
*  Nothing like AIPAC. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3358.44s)]
*  Nothing like AIPAC, [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3359.84s)]
*  but there are other countries [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3360.96s)]
*  that are financially incentivized. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3362.0800000000004s)]
*  They certainly have, yeah, [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3363.6400000000003s)]
*  there's business interests all around, [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3364.76s)]
*  but AIPAC is particularly powerful [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3366.44s)]
*  and is very good at getting people in a lot of trouble [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3368.6800000000003s)]
*  if they're critical of Israel. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3374.5600000000004s)]
*  And on top of that, [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3376.32s)]
*  then you have this kind of widespread belief [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3377.32s)]
*  amongst evangelical Christians [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3380.04s)]
*  that the Jews kind of have to be in control of Israel [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3382.0800000000004s)]
*  in order for Jesus to come back and save them or whatever. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3385.6000000000004s)]
*  Boy, did that work out for the Jews, huh? [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3388.8s)]
*  Well, if you listen to the evangelicals, [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3392.4s)]
*  it's not gonna work out well ultimately. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3393.7200000000003s)]
*  They get Israel for a little bit, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3396.1200000000003s)]
*  but you're not coming along for this, Rob, [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3397.6800000000003s)]
*  just so you know. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3400.0s)]
*  It doesn't actually help you that much, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3401.5600000000004s)]
*  but you better accept Jesus pretty soon. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3404.0s)]
*  They'll convert. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3406.5200000000004s)]
*  If you see the J-Man come back, you got it, right? [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3408.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3410.6400000000003s)]
*  Hey, if he comes back, I'll sign up. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3411.48s)]
*  Comes back, let's go. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3413.5200000000004s)]
*  I'll tell you- [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3414.8s)]
*  He's back! [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3415.6400000000003s)]
*  He said he comes back! [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3416.48s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3417.32s)]
*  I'll tell you, and you can, as a Jewish person myself, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3418.92s)]
*  we are a stubborn people. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3422.0s)]
*  And I can see a lot of Jews, [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3424.16s)]
*  even if Jesus came back, just being like, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3426.24s)]
*  no, no, it's an illusion. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3428.44s)]
*  So there's a weird relationship where, [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3432.8799999999997s)]
*  because of a lot of different circumstances, [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3437.68s)]
*  American politicians are kind of, [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3441.24s)]
*  have an inability to put any pressure on Israel, [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3444.08s)]
*  but are required to support them. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3447.64s)]
*  So what are those circumstances? [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3449.2000000000003s)]
*  Again, I truly just don't know. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3450.52s)]
*  And I think this is important [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3452.28s)]
*  because this helps people veer away from anti-Semitism. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3453.32s)]
*  I wanna be critical. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3456.6s)]
*  All that stuff is stupid, by the way. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3458.44s)]
*  But I don't wanna empower these fucking idiots. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3459.28s)]
*  Listen, people are insecure. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3461.12s)]
*  I think they're insecure to ask even questions. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3464.44s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3467.32s)]
*  No, but I think they're concerned to ask questions [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3468.76s)]
*  because they're like, I don't wanna come across [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3470.44s)]
*  as one of these people that I see [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3472.04s)]
*  are just blatantly anti-Semitic. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3473.12s)]
*  And I don't wanna stay silent. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3474.48s)]
*  Giving them any ammo. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3475.88s)]
*  Listen, I completely understand that. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3477.4s)]
*  And it's like, I don't know. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3479.44s)]
*  Because there's no question [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3481.32s)]
*  there is an absurd amount of anti-Semitism online right now. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3482.1600000000003s)]
*  But there are questions that are not anti-Semitic at all [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3487.6400000000003s)]
*  that we should be able to ask and get to the bottom of. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3490.08s)]
*  And like steel man the answers. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3492.0s)]
*  Literally give, what would APAC's best argument be? [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3493.8s)]
*  Well, sure, but also if you don't, [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3497.32s)]
*  it's almost like if you don't ask these questions [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3498.96s)]
*  that are reasonable questions, [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3501.6400000000003s)]
*  then you cede the ground to the Jew haters [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3503.1200000000003s)]
*  and those are the only people [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3505.4s)]
*  who are asking these questions. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3506.44s)]
*  And then they seem like, [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3507.6800000000003s)]
*  how come no one else is willing to talk about that? [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3508.52s)]
*  So if you want to be critical of Israel [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3510.8s)]
*  and not Jewish people, you say, hey, here's the issue. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3512.84s)]
*  And not just that, but like- [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3514.84s)]
*  We just wanna know about the relationship. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3515.6800000000003s)]
*  But dude, the best critics, [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3517.2400000000002s)]
*  or at least a lot of the best critics of Israel [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3518.56s)]
*  are Jewish people. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3520.6s)]
*  I mean, the tradition of Jews who criticize Israel [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3521.48s)]
*  is like, I mean, from Noam Chomsky to Max Blumenthal [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3524.4s)]
*  and Glenn Greenwald. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3528.4s)]
*  And like there's a ton of Jews who are like- [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3529.56s)]
*  That's the other conversation I want to get to eventually. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3530.4s)]
*  I mean, I think it's gonna be like, [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3533.04s)]
*  what do Israelis think right now? [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3534.28s)]
*  And I think that we may have lost [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3537.68s)]
*  the plot with that a little bit. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3539.6s)]
*  America got tons of criticism for the war in Iraq. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3541.36s)]
*  And there was a separation though. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3544.6s)]
*  I think people would be like, America's fucked up, [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3547.04s)]
*  but I like American music, I like American TV shows, [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3549.44s)]
*  I like American culture, but America was fucked up. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3551.86s)]
*  And there was this separation. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3554.52s)]
*  And I feel like with Israel, there isn't that much. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3555.7200000000003s)]
*  So I'm curious what the people there think. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3557.96s)]
*  But get to that after we get back here. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3560.48s)]
*  Well, either way, I mean, it's a really good point. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3561.88s)]
*  And in fact, it was in Osama Bin Laden's declaration [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3565.56s)]
*  of war against America that he basically said, [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3569.1600000000003s)]
*  like, look, here are our grievances [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3572.92s)]
*  is what your government's done to us. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3574.48s)]
*  And since you guys have free elections [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3576.48s)]
*  and you've elected this government, [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3580.42s)]
*  you are also fair game and we can also kill your citizens. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3582.1400000000003s)]
*  And so like, but I'm just saying [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3585.6800000000003s)]
*  that's the mentality of Osama Bin Laden. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3586.76s)]
*  If you follow the story, not the good guy in the story. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3589.76s)]
*  And so that's the mentality of saying [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3593.36s)]
*  that you're not gonna separate the actions of a government [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3595.0s)]
*  from some dude who runs a bakery or something there. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3597.8s)]
*  They're all the same thing. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3600.6800000000003s)]
*  But we do elect him. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3601.5200000000004s)]
*  He has a good point. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3602.76s)]
*  Yeah, but at the same time, you can't hold [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3603.6000000000004s)]
*  regular people responsible for the crimes [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3606.5600000000004s)]
*  of their government. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3608.6800000000003s)]
*  And especially you when you look at how corrupt [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3609.5200000000004s)]
*  and nefarious governments can be [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3611.96s)]
*  and how they can restrict the people's ability [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3613.5200000000004s)]
*  to be represented, of course. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3615.6400000000003s)]
*  But the idea in like a true representative government, [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3617.28s)]
*  it would be like, hey, you put that guy there [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3619.84s)]
*  and he is doing your bidding. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3621.6400000000003s)]
*  We now know that that is not the case. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3623.5600000000004s)]
*  You can't hold us accountable [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3625.52s)]
*  because we're kind of held hostage. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3627.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's right. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3629.48s)]
*  So that separation should exist [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3630.88s)]
*  and there's that protection. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3632.36s)]
*  But the logic is if it was a true democracy, [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3633.2000000000003s)]
*  the logic would make sense. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3636.4s)]
*  I can kind of get where you're coming from. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3638.48s)]
*  I'd still say. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3640.2400000000002s)]
*  Because you don't know what they're gonna do [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3641.0800000000004s)]
*  once you elect them into office. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3642.52s)]
*  They told us a bunch of things [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3643.92s)]
*  and then they can flip the script once they're in. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3645.2000000000003s)]
*  Okay, that's a fair point. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3647.28s)]
*  But if they went into office with these ideas [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3648.28s)]
*  and we elected them for that reason, [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3651.2000000000003s)]
*  you could at least hold the people [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3653.16s)]
*  that elected them accountable? [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3654.32s)]
*  I mean, I guess. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3655.8s)]
*  I don't think you can kill them, though. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3656.64s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3657.96s)]
*  Listen, I always tend to be like on the side of people [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3658.8s)]
*  against the corrupt powerful. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3662.08s)]
*  And also who was running on a, [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3663.8s)]
*  hey, let's kill everybody in the Middle East policy. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3665.08s)]
*  Yeah, even in those situations, [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3667.12s)]
*  they always kind of propagandize people [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3669.56s)]
*  into thinking they need to do this [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3671.56s)]
*  or it's not gonna be in their interest. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3673.44s)]
*  Look, as far as how the people in Israel are feeling, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3676.08s)]
*  I'd say that, let's say pre-October 7th, [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3679.84s)]
*  just like historically, there's always been, [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3683.36s)]
*  always been a much wider array of opinion on Israel [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3686.68s)]
*  inside Israel than there is in the United States of America. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3690.2799999999997s)]
*  And there's been tremendous pressure [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3693.84s)]
*  put on the Israeli government by Israelis [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3697.88s)]
*  to not be so brutal to the Palestinians over the years. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3702.72s)]
*  Like there's a lot, listen, it was in a, [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3705.68s)]
*  I mean, it ended up making its way to our press too. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3707.88s)]
*  But on October 8th, Tal Schneider for the Times of Israel [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3710.88s)]
*  wrote a huge piece about how for years [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3716.96s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu propped up Hamas. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3720.16s)]
*  And it was like the next day, [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3723.16s)]
*  there was like, this is your creation, [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3725.36s)]
*  or maybe not creation, but at least you've aided them [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3727.2799999999997s)]
*  for your own purposes for all of these years. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3731.24s)]
*  And look what happened now. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3733.4399999999996s)]
*  You got all of our people killed over this [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3734.96s)]
*  and now we got this war on our hands. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3737.24s)]
*  And so like they were pointing the finger right at him. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3738.9199999999996s)]
*  Whereas like on October 8th, you wouldn't have had, [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3741.16s)]
*  if someone had said that here, [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3743.4399999999996s)]
*  that'd have been crazy radioactive. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3745.12s)]
*  And so like there is a diversity of opinion. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3748.04s)]
*  Also, like anything else, there's this kind of rally [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3751.3599999999997s)]
*  around the flag effect. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3754.9199999999996s)]
*  And after October 7th, there was a lot of people in Israel [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3756.04s)]
*  who were like, let's go get these guys no matter what, [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3759.44s)]
*  which is kind of the same way we felt after 9-11 [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3761.68s)]
*  and all of that. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3764.44s)]
*  And by the way, the same way the Palestinians feel [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3765.28s)]
*  after some Israeli strike kills a bunch of them. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3768.64s)]
*  And they're like, let's go get them. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3771.2000000000003s)]
*  They're easily galvanized. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3772.36s)]
*  Have you heard that there's congressmen [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3773.44s)]
*  are like assigned an APAC handler? [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3775.52s)]
*  Like there was like dude from Kentucky that said that. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3777.8s)]
*  Thomas Nasty. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3779.52s)]
*  So break this down, yeah. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3780.36s)]
*  So break down APAC, how they influence, [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3781.2000000000003s)]
*  break down this that the- [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3783.56s)]
*  Do you believe that? [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3785.12s)]
*  No, no, it's actually true. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3785.96s)]
*  There's a checklist. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3788.04s)]
*  It's 100%. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3789.7999999999997s)]
*  They're gonna be in congress or the senate. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3790.64s)]
*  Like part of your thing is you do the trip [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3791.48s)]
*  and everyone gets to say I've gone on that trip to Israel. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3793.7599999999998s)]
*  It's their birthright. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3796.92s)]
*  Wow. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3798.04s)]
*  Yeah, I can't deny it because someone I've gone to a talk [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3800.88s)]
*  and then they'll come to me [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3805.52s)]
*  and they want me to pledge my 1800. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3806.7599999999998s)]
*  So you're Jewish like me, right? [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3809.3199999999997s)]
*  So how crazy is it that you- [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3811.64s)]
*  Not like you. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3814.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3815.12s)]
*  A little different. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3815.96s)]
*  Okay, fair enough. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3817.2799999999997s)]
*  So you're a good one. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3818.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3819.96s)]
*  Both your dicks are cut. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3820.8s)]
*  That's great. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3821.64s)]
*  We're really talking about it. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3823.48s)]
*  How crazy is it, right, that even that, [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3825.72s)]
*  so I mean I don't think I have mine anymore. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3827.48s)]
*  I'm not sure but I don't think they would let me in. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3829.56s)]
*  But just being Jewish, you have what they call a birthright [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3831.56s)]
*  to go to Israel on them. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3836.6s)]
*  A free trip. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3840.36s)]
*  And you can also become a citizen there anytime. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3841.2s)]
*  Like you have a right to Israel. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3843.08s)]
*  Yet the people living in that land [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3845.32s)]
*  for hundreds of years before the Zionist project [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3848.52s)]
*  have no right to return to their homes. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3852.8s)]
*  They still have keys, some of the older ones, [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3856.6400000000003s)]
*  there to their homes. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3858.48s)]
*  And they have no right to go back to it [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3859.32s)]
*  which is just so wild to me. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3860.84s)]
*  But anyway, that's kind of neither here nor there. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3862.6000000000004s)]
*  I'm sorry, what was the- [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3865.5600000000004s)]
*  Hey, Pat, just the- [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3866.84s)]
*  Yes, well- [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3868.5600000000004s)]
*  Overarching conversations, [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3869.4s)]
*  how can you have so much- Thomas Masson's telling the truth [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3870.7200000000003s)]
*  about that, yeah. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3872.0400000000004s)]
*  They- [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3872.88s)]
*  Or maybe first can you just explain [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3873.92s)]
*  how lobbying works in general and then break down- [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3875.8s)]
*  Well, I'd say it like this, okay? [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3879.2400000000002s)]
*  So after 9-11, Colin Powell went to George W. Bush. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3881.88s)]
*  Colin Powell was the wisest member [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3887.6s)]
*  of the George W. Bush administration. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3890.04s)]
*  Still pretty bad guy. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3892.36s)]
*  But he was by far the wisest [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3894.28s)]
*  of the people in George W. Bush's room. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3897.12s)]
*  And the thing he told George W. Bush after 9-11 was, [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3899.2000000000003s)]
*  you have to make a two-state solution now. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3902.2s)]
*  This is the time to do it. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3905.2s)]
*  You just hit 9-11, you have record high approval ratings. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3906.64s)]
*  This is the time that you can cram this through [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3909.44s)]
*  and get it done. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3911.24s)]
*  And you have to do it. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3912.08s)]
*  And why? [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3913.6s)]
*  Because he knew. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3914.48s)]
*  He goes, this is at the heart [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3915.3199999999997s)]
*  of why we have this terrorism problem. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3917.2799999999997s)]
*  A big, the central reason why they hate us [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3919.6s)]
*  is because we prop up Israel [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3923.3999999999996s)]
*  and they kicked the Palestinians out of their holy land. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3925.6s)]
*  And they, you know what I mean? [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3928.8799999999997s)]
*  And then there were other reasons too. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3929.92s)]
*  They didn't like that we had our military bases [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3931.48s)]
*  in Saudi Arabia bombing Iraq and all of these things. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3933.08s)]
*  But he really pushed him to do it. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3936.84s)]
*  And George W. Bush agreed. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3938.08s)]
*  He was like, okay, I mean, if Colin Powell tells me [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3939.48s)]
*  that's what I gotta do, I'll go do that. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3941.84s)]
*  And then it was Tom DeLay in the House of Representatives [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3943.4s)]
*  who said, if you push for a two-state solution, [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3946.76s)]
*  I guarantee you're a one-term president. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3949.84s)]
*  Because AIPAC will turn on you in a second. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3953.0s)]
*  We will whip every evangelical Christian against you. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3955.88s)]
*  Like it's just over for you. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3959.44s)]
*  And so he just gave up on doing it. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3961.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3962.7999999999997s)]
*  That's kind of in effect how it works. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3963.88s)]
*  So the evangelical vote is tied to the Israeli lobby [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3966.16s)]
*  in a way, even though they're really not tied [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3971.96s)]
*  for like the future, but for the immediate. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3975.56s)]
*  Kind of, yeah. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3978.48s)]
*  This is like that thing you were saying [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3979.3199999999997s)]
*  where like there's two different things [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3980.24s)]
*  that have the same interest. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3981.6s)]
*  Yeah. Right, right. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3982.44s)]
*  What's interesting is you go from, [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3983.56s)]
*  I mean, what percentage of Americans are Jewish? [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3986.04s)]
*  I mean, by the 2.2%. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3989.52s)]
*  I thought you were gonna say too many. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3991.6000000000004s)]
*  Too many. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3992.84s)]
*  So if the evangelical Christians are tied to, [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=3993.6800000000003s)]
*  I guess, let's just call it American Jews. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4002.36s)]
*  I know American Jews that all have the same opinion, [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4004.32s)]
*  but let's just call it percentage-wise. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4006.44s)]
*  You take that 2% and you increase it significantly. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4008.0400000000004s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4011.6000000000004s)]
*  There's a lot of evangelical Christians in this country. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4012.44s)]
*  There's like tens of millions of them. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4015.1200000000003s)]
*  So now it's not such a minor. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4016.6400000000003s)]
*  I think a lot of times that people are looking at [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4017.92s)]
*  and they throw that number around, [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4019.32s)]
*  why do we have so much consideration [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4020.44s)]
*  for 2% of the population? [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4021.76s)]
*  Well, because 2% of the population and a large swath [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4022.8s)]
*  and a huge voting bloc all agree [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4026.28s)]
*  on a really important thing for their identity. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4028.6800000000003s)]
*  So you're not really looking at 2%. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4031.2400000000002s)]
*  Got it. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4033.2000000000003s)]
*  Now, okay, now it's making sense. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4034.0400000000004s)]
*  You start, but you do, it kind of built up this culture. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4035.28s)]
*  And again, this isn't anything like that. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4039.8s)]
*  It's not, the problem when people go down the path [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4042.8s)]
*  of like just like the anti-Semitic stuff, [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4045.32s)]
*  just hating Jews in general, [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4047.76s)]
*  is that it's like with anything else. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4049.56s)]
*  It's like the same mistake that feminists make [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4051.48s)]
*  whenever they talk about men. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4053.92s)]
*  Or like when a feminist will just be like, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4055.8s)]
*  you know, they'll be like, [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4057.8s)]
*  95% of the CEOs of Fortune 500 companies are men. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4059.2s)]
*  And then they extrapolate from that some comment on men. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4065.08s)]
*  But you're like, but that's not men. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4068.6s)]
*  That's like this tiny substrata of men, [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4070.36s)]
*  the tiniest of men. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4072.68s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4074.28s)]
*  It's like being the CEO of a Fortune 500 company [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4075.36s)]
*  does not explain the life of an average man at all. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4078.12s)]
*  And then you're like, oh, well, you could also look at like, [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4082.12s)]
*  you know, prisons or homeless or all that. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4084.2s)]
*  You know, it's just like whenever you try to collectivize [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4086.88s)]
*  people, right, it's much more complicated than that. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4089.04s)]
*  But it's also like there are, Jews are very successful, [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4092.3599999999997s)]
*  broadly speaking. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4096.36s)]
*  And so, all right, if you offend Jews, [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4097.68s)]
*  there ends up being consequences [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4102.72s)]
*  that there aren't necessarily for other groups. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4104.8s)]
*  I mean, look, if you think about like, say, [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4107.0s)]
*  let's imagine like black people in this country [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4110.2s)]
*  had the wealth that Jewish people have. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4113.56s)]
*  And after the George Floyd thing or something, someone- [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4117.24s)]
*  The government will start making sneakers. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4120.36s)]
*  So now the government's making sneakers, okay? [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4122.0s)]
*  And then making them good sneakers. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4124.8s)]
*  But so, after George Floyd, someone goes like, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4126.24s)]
*  ah, he was on fentanyl or blah, blah, blah. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4129.4s)]
*  I don't think the cop did anything wrong. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4131.68s)]
*  You think that guy would lose his job or lose his pet? [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4133.64s)]
*  There might be some black people who are like, [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4135.68s)]
*  no, you know what, we're gonna punish this guy [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4137.72s)]
*  for saying that thing. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4138.56s)]
*  So that does end up happening, right? [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4139.56s)]
*  People do kind of get like punished [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4141.16s)]
*  for speaking out against this. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4142.6s)]
*  And then that starts building up [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4144.28s)]
*  like a resentment against it. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4147.28s)]
*  Well, yeah, well, who resents it? [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4149.36s)]
*  The people who speak up about it for sure. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4152.0s)]
*  Yeah, and a lot of people on Twitter. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4154.84s)]
*  Do you get fired for simply speaking out, or do you get, [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4156.76s)]
*  or punished rather, or do you get punished [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4159.8s)]
*  for saying something that is not true? [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4162.56s)]
*  I think there's definitely been cases of people [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4165.9s)]
*  getting punished for saying things that are true. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4168.54s)]
*  I mean, I remember Pat Buchanan said once, [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4170.78s)]
*  this was years ago, right, this was like in the 90s, [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4172.98s)]
*  and he was talking about the first war in Iraq, [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4175.219999999999s)]
*  the Persian Gulf War under George H.W. Bush. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4177.78s)]
*  And he goes, nobody in America wants this war in Iraq, [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4181.0599999999995s)]
*  except for some weapons companies and the Israel lobby. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4186.0199999999995s)]
*  And they flipped out on him for saying that. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4189.9s)]
*  And they liked it. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4192.82s)]
*  Did they? [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4193.66s)]
*  They totally wanted it. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4194.98s)]
*  Because they're, because you're just not, [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4196.46s)]
*  it's anti-Semitic. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4197.94s)]
*  What are you saying? [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4199.1s)]
*  Oh, you're saying the Jews want war. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4199.94s)]
*  You're saying that Jews are manipulating us into war, [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4201.26s)]
*  like something like that. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4203.34s)]
*  But like, no, he was talking about a very specific group. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4204.18s)]
*  And look for- [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4206.62s)]
*  I mean, aren't there like minutes, [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4207.62s)]
*  aren't there like records that show that they have been? [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4209.66s)]
*  It just doesn't matter. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4211.46s)]
*  Yeah, but like it just- [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4212.3s)]
*  If they have been. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4213.14s)]
*  Well, they certainly were lobbying for it. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4213.98s)]
*  No question about it. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4215.98s)]
*  Look, Ben- [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4216.9s)]
*  Why would it be advantageous to them? [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4217.74s)]
*  Well, because they were, [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4218.7s)]
*  Saddam Hussein was a big rival of Israel. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4221.58s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu came and testified before Congress [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4224.900000000001s)]
*  in 2002, right after 9-11. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4227.900000000001s)]
*  This is now going to the next. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4230.26s)]
*  And he came over and testified as a regional expert [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4231.58s)]
*  that if we just overthrow Saddam Hussein, [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4234.42s)]
*  democracy will sweep the region [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4236.66s)]
*  and it'll have all these positive reverberations. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4238.3s)]
*  Oh, by the way, you should also have a regime change war [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4240.54s)]
*  in Iran. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4242.820000000001s)]
*  That should be next up for you guys. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4243.74s)]
*  But it is just kind of all his enemies, [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4245.46s)]
*  like all his regional enemies. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4247.74s)]
*  He's lobbying us to get our young boys [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4249.58s)]
*  to go fight a war over there on his behalf. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4253.18s)]
*  Now, when you call that out, [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4256.22s)]
*  if you call that out, it's very easy to sound anti-Semitic. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4257.9800000000005s)]
*  But like, you don't have to be, [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4261.740000000001s)]
*  you don't have to hate Jews to just point out [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4263.42s)]
*  that it's like, well, hey, look, [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4265.34s)]
*  there's a foreign government lobbying us into a war. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4266.34s)]
*  Question. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4269.62s)]
*  It is their job to lobby us. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4272.26s)]
*  Sure. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4276.3s)]
*  It is every country's job to convince [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4277.34s)]
*  the more powerful countries [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4280.46s)]
*  to do the things that they want. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4282.26s)]
*  Don't we kind of gotta blame the evangelical Christians? [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4286.34s)]
*  I'm just like, you can't, no, no, no. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4289.18s)]
*  Yes. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4292.18s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4293.02s)]
*  Ultimately, we have to take responsibility [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4295.58s)]
*  for what we do as a country. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4297.14s)]
*  But what I'm trying to say is [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4298.26s)]
*  they are so easily manipulated [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4299.1s)]
*  into supporting a foreign government [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4301.38s)]
*  because of this thing that they believe in [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4303.54s)]
*  that now, and without them, the lobbying wouldn't work [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4305.62s)]
*  based on what I'm understanding from you. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4309.34s)]
*  I think all of it's- [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4310.98s)]
*  You need the numbers and you need the votes. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4311.82s)]
*  It's not just the money. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4313.0199999999995s)]
*  You can't just pay the politicians. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4313.86s)]
*  You still need votes at the end of the day. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4315.339999999999s)]
*  I more than agree. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4316.78s)]
*  I think there's a lot of blame to go around. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4318.219999999999s)]
*  And there's a lot of people who are- [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4320.339999999999s)]
*  And that could be, that seems like it's in, [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4321.179999999999s)]
*  but I guess what I'm just trying to say is, [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4322.259999999999s)]
*  I don't totally believe that you could do this [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4323.86s)]
*  without voting support. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4328.179999999999s)]
*  Oh, no, 100%. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4330.259999999999s)]
*  So you need a group to come and support blindly. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4331.259999999999s)]
*  And it seems like they're supporting blindly. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4334.86s)]
*  But isn't it groups like APAC and evangelical groups [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4337.219999999999s)]
*  that tell them which way to vote? [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4340.38s)]
*  It's the groups that are telling them which way to vote. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4343.9400000000005s)]
*  So it's like, I'm gonna blame the actual evangelical [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4346.46s)]
*  when it just like- [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4349.22s)]
*  If I'm a country, right, and I'm friends with America, [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4350.06s)]
*  I'm trying to get America to do everything I want. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4354.38s)]
*  Of course. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4356.54s)]
*  I'm like, yo, these guys are trying to knock down our door. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4357.38s)]
*  They're trying to kill us. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4359.18s)]
*  Should we just take them out? [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4360.02s)]
*  Can we get the better trade agreement with China [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4361.62s)]
*  for this thing over? [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4363.54s)]
*  Every day I'm calling up America and I'm like, [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4364.62s)]
*  what can we do to make my country's life better? [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4366.9800000000005s)]
*  But the criticism of Israel is not what they do to America. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4370.0599999999995s)]
*  It's what they're doing to Palestine. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4373.78s)]
*  But, well, I think it's twofold. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4376.0599999999995s)]
*  It's like, yes, there's criticism for that 100%. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4378.78s)]
*  But it's the fact that we're supporting it, [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4380.86s)]
*  which makes our discourse here so intense. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4382.86s)]
*  Because you look at it on paper. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4388.86s)]
*  If they were doing it- [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4389.9s)]
*  Why are we agreeing to do these things? [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4390.74s)]
*  And then we see the politicians like, [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4392.98s)]
*  why are the politicians agreeing to do these things? [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4394.82s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4396.7s)]
*  So the person you get mad at is the person [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4397.54s)]
*  who's forcing the politicians to do it. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4398.82s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't stop on Netanyahu in that. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4400.139999999999s)]
*  Who was saying, all right, we'll follow this little path? [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4401.86s)]
*  Like, who's his- [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4405.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, look, again, so there's all types of blame [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4406.139999999999s)]
*  to go around, right? [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4409.5s)]
*  But I wouldn't let Netanyahu off the hook for that either [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4410.62s)]
*  because it's not as if he's just advocating that, [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4415.299999999999s)]
*  oh, we get more foreign aid to Israel or something. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4418.299999999999s)]
*  Can I clarify my position? [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4419.74s)]
*  He could be advocating for something disgusting, [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4421.139999999999s)]
*  horrible, horrific. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4424.179999999999s)]
*  That's bad. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4426.62s)]
*  But let's say he's doing what he believes [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4428.58s)]
*  is the best thing for his country. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4431.0199999999995s)]
*  We as Americans should be able to look and go, [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4433.299999999999s)]
*  that's disgusting, horrible, horrific. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4435.66s)]
*  We're not supporting that. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4437.0599999999995s)]
*  And then one day he might be like, [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4438.219999999999s)]
*  oh, here's this cool technology, we wanna trade with you. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4439.5s)]
*  And we'll be like, well, that's really cool. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4441.419999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we'll do that trade. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4442.9s)]
*  But it seems to me, and again, I might not know, [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4444.139999999999s)]
*  that because of this large voting block, [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4446.58s)]
*  these evangelicals that will blindly support [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4450.0599999999995s)]
*  whatever Israel wants, [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4452.299999999999s)]
*  we are manipulated into the support of these things [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4454.820000000001s)]
*  that we find horrendous. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4457.58s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with that. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4459.34s)]
*  Is that too simplistic? [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4460.18s)]
*  No, give me pushback. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4462.02s)]
*  Sorry, many people have their resurrection. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4463.860000000001s)]
*  Many people have their issue, trans bathrooms. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4466.42s)]
*  The masses are easily manipulated. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4469.46s)]
*  You just find the hot button issue for any voting block. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4471.860000000001s)]
*  You can flip them. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4475.14s)]
*  I just gotta press the right button. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4476.46s)]
*  So their button happens to be this. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4477.9800000000005s)]
*  But this is very tricky because in order to do that, [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4480.58s)]
*  in order for what the evangelicals want to happen, [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4484.54s)]
*  they need to secure the Jews in the Holy Land. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4488.379999999999s)]
*  And if the Jews simply go, hey guys, [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4491.219999999999s)]
*  if you don't support us in this war, [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4493.179999999999s)]
*  we're not gonna be in the Holy Land, [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4495.139999999999s)]
*  J-Man not coming back. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4496.86s)]
*  So they have to go, we gotta keep them there, [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4498.259999999999s)]
*  whatever they gotta do. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4501.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but that's what I'm saying. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4502.54s)]
*  It's bigger than trans bathrooms is what I'm trying to say. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4504.62s)]
*  It is. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4506.74s)]
*  I can't speak for an evangelical, [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4508.58s)]
*  but I think if you ask most people and they're like, [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4510.0599999999995s)]
*  if you see the images, what's going on in Gaza, [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4513.22s)]
*  how do you feel about that? [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4515.5s)]
*  I think most people will be like, that's bad. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4516.62s)]
*  It makes me feel bad. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4518.42s)]
*  But if the group, if APAC or if an evangelical group [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4519.42s)]
*  is like, they are holding hostage their group of voters [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4522.62s)]
*  to force politicians to do their bidding. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4527.1s)]
*  So I don't think it's the actual people that are just like, [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4529.34s)]
*  nah, we need to keep sending money to Israel. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4531.7s)]
*  I think it's the group that's telling the politicians like, [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4534.18s)]
*  hey, if you don't keep sending money to Israel, [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4537.46s)]
*  I'm gonna get my whole voting block [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4539.58s)]
*  to vote against you next time. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4541.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4543.02s)]
*  So I'm not putting it on the people at all. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4543.860000000001s)]
*  I put it all on the group that control the people. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4544.700000000001s)]
*  And they control the news cycle to say Hamas is doing X, Y, [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4546.54s)]
*  and Z, it's all Hamas, we gotta get Hamas out of here. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4548.42s)]
*  You can, yeah. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4550.5s)]
*  Sure, there's horrible manipulation [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4551.34s)]
*  and propaganda going on. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4553.38s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4554.580000000001s)]
*  What I'm saying is without that specific group, [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4556.06s)]
*  maybe they find another group, [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4559.3s)]
*  but without that group, I don't know if it's possible. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4560.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know either. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4563.02s)]
*  Do you think it is? [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4564.38s)]
*  I think that there's no question that that voting block [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4565.9400000000005s)]
*  has been like indispensable for them. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4568.94s)]
*  So, but then again, to your point, [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4571.419999999999s)]
*  it's also like, it's not just, [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4573.7s)]
*  it's like every evangelical, I shouldn't say every, [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4575.379999999999s)]
*  but so many evangelical pastors are out there [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4577.9s)]
*  like preaching to their people [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4581.179999999999s)]
*  and you gotta support Israel [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4583.0599999999995s)]
*  and you gotta support the politicians who support them. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4584.62s)]
*  So it's a, again, it's like there's, [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4586.98s)]
*  I don't know what any one of these factors not being there, [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4590.179999999999s)]
*  we might be looking at a different equation. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4593.219999999999s)]
*  How do you disconnect the two? [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4594.62s)]
*  Yeah, that's great. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4597.099999999999s)]
*  Is there no conversation within the evangelical, [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4597.94s)]
*  I imagine there is a conversation [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4599.54s)]
*  in the evangelical community of God. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4601.0599999999995s)]
*  There is, and I think there's even debates [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4601.9s)]
*  and this I just don't know enough about. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4603.299999999999s)]
*  I don't know enough about whether this is [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4605.54s)]
*  theologically correct or not, [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4609.62s)]
*  but there's a whole other argument, [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4611.62s)]
*  which I tend to think that they're right, [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4613.179999999999s)]
*  that there's a whole other group of Christians who are like, [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4614.98s)]
*  by the way, this is a complete misinterpretation [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4617.62s)]
*  of the Bible. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4619.66s)]
*  That we don't need Jews there. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4620.5s)]
*  This is not a real thing. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4622.299999999999s)]
*  This is just, that's like, [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4623.74s)]
*  so again, I don't know enough about that. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4625.0599999999995s)]
*  I mean, there's like specific language in the Bible [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4626.06s)]
*  that says, specifically in the Old Testament, [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4627.9800000000005s)]
*  that like all people, or like anyone who goes against Israel [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4629.580000000001s)]
*  and it says exactly Israel will be cursed [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4633.38s)]
*  and all people that support Israel will be blessed. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4635.26s)]
*  And that's word from God. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4637.3s)]
*  And so people like evangelical pastors [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4638.860000000001s)]
*  interpret that literally to say the nation of Israel. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4640.740000000001s)]
*  Whereas other people interpret that to say, [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4643.780000000001s)]
*  oh, this is a metaphor for God's people. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4645.38s)]
*  That all the people that are a part of. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4649.42s)]
*  Written way before the creation of the state of Israel. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4651.38s)]
*  So it's like not clear that that's what they're referring to. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4653.86s)]
*  But it is in reference to like the Old Testament nation [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4656.139999999999s)]
*  of the Israeli Jews. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4659.0199999999995s)]
*  So it is what some people would say is a metaphor [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4660.54s)]
*  to say all of God's chosen people. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4663.62s)]
*  Yeah, but that's Old Testament, [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4665.66s)]
*  aren't y'all the New Testament? [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4666.66s)]
*  Well, hold on, hold on one second. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4667.74s)]
*  They work in tandem based on interpretation. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4668.58s)]
*  But God's chosen people being the Jews. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4670.54s)]
*  Being Christians is what a new interpretation would be. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4673.339999999999s)]
*  That Israel is in reference to all people [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4676.86s)]
*  that are Christian that follow God. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4679.219999999999s)]
*  That read the Bible and Old Testament and New Testament. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4681.38s)]
*  I don't like this one. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4684.22s)]
*  Shifty, you hear anything about this? [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4685.06s)]
*  Keep it that way. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4687.18s)]
*  What has your interpretation been? [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4688.02s)]
*  What have you been taught? [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4690.38s)]
*  So I was brought up that everyone was God's chosen people. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4691.22s)]
*  And that's what Christians are. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4695.22s)]
*  If everyone's God's chosen people, [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4697.46s)]
*  then God doesn't really have a chosen people. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4699.58s)]
*  Well, not everyone. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4701.3s)]
*  Then we got to, it's like if everyone's beautiful. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4702.14s)]
*  What does that mean anymore? [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4704.54s)]
*  That Israel's basically. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4707.26s)]
*  He is a Jew. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4708.46s)]
*  We got to be. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4711.62s)]
*  It's a demon. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4712.46s)]
*  It's a kick. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4713.3s)]
*  I mean, I can only go so far. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4715.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4716.54s)]
*  That all people could be chosen, [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4718.42s)]
*  that Israel is a metaphor for all Christians of the world. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4719.860000000001s)]
*  Okay, so are you familiar at all [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4722.34s)]
*  with the evangelical discourse about this? [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4724.38s)]
*  I'm not super familiar with it. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4727.900000000001s)]
*  I know that there's been like, [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4729.3s)]
*  I've heard like some Catholics and like Orthodox Christians [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4730.5s)]
*  really giving pushback to the evangelicals about this [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4736.5s)]
*  because they don't believe any of that stuff. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4739.46s)]
*  They're like, whatever it is. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4741.42s)]
*  I don't remember. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4742.5s)]
*  You know, I just don't know enough. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4743.34s)]
*  But it's something like, [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4744.18s)]
*  yeah, that's not even what Israel means by that. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4745.0s)]
*  Israel means something else. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4746.7s)]
*  It certainly doesn't mean any like political group [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4748.22s)]
*  that was formed in 1948. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4750.54s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4752.7s)]
*  Like that's not right. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4753.54s)]
*  Either way, you know, like that's not, [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4755.62s)]
*  like that's not what motivates me [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4759.5s)]
*  is like what is the correct interpretation of the Bible. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4761.94s)]
*  I'm just saying that. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4764.74s)]
*  Like personally, I think this is really bad policy [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4766.26s)]
*  for Israel. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4769.74s)]
*  I think it's totally self-destructive for them. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4771.02s)]
*  And they, I mean, I think they've totally [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4773.18s)]
*  turned global opinion against them. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4775.34s)]
*  They're now like, they're now on the precipice [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4777.5s)]
*  of a much wider war. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4779.7s)]
*  They've had conflict with the Houthis in Yemen [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4781.42s)]
*  and with Hezbollah in Lebanon. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4783.9400000000005s)]
*  With Iran, obviously there's always building, [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4786.780000000001s)]
*  you know, like tensions there. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4789.1s)]
*  And so it's like, oh, you're looking at like this [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4791.06s)]
*  much wider regional war with the world opinion [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4792.66s)]
*  turning against you. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4795.46s)]
*  The most destructive thing is lying to yourself. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4796.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4798.78s)]
*  Is there not a strategic advantage? [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4800.46s)]
*  Yeah, wasn't that the plan, their plan maybe? [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4801.78s)]
*  Is there not a strategic advantage to having, [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4804.22s)]
*  I heard people say this, like having a democracy [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4806.9s)]
*  in the region, like a Western alliance with. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4808.62s)]
*  The thing is like, first, I don't know. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4811.06s)]
*  I mean, the issue is that Israel isn't really a democracy. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4813.26s)]
*  And like they, I mean, they're a democracy within Israel, [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4819.66s)]
*  but Israel has had control of Gaza and the West Bank [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4824.42s)]
*  since 1967. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4828.5s)]
*  And you could kind of get away with occupying [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4830.42s)]
*  a group of people for, you know, a few years after a war [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4833.14s)]
*  while you're figuring out what you're gonna do [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4836.9400000000005s)]
*  or on the transition to giving them their independence [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4838.900000000001s)]
*  or something, but I mean, they've been occupying. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4841.42s)]
*  And they'll, I already hear in the YouTube comments, [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4843.62s)]
*  people will be like, well, they pulled out of Gaza in 2005. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4846.1s)]
*  It's like, yeah, and then they put a full blockade [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4848.74s)]
*  around the country and they dominate every single inch [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4850.38s)]
*  of what happens in Gaza. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4852.66s)]
*  But, you know, if you've been occupying, [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4855.58s)]
*  it's five million Palestinians between, [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4858.099999999999s)]
*  or something in that ballpark between Gaza [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4860.94s)]
*  and the West Bank. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4862.86s)]
*  None of them have any voting rights. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4863.7s)]
*  None of them have any rights at all. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4865.22s)]
*  And so how long can you have control of an area [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4866.78s)]
*  with a whole bunch of non-citizens [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4870.22s)]
*  who don't have voting rights before you sit there and go, [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4871.94s)]
*  but they're the only democracy in the regions. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4874.5s)]
*  Like, not really. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4876.42s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4878.42s)]
*  I mean, I don't think we would consider it a democracy [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4879.26s)]
*  if you had half your population [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4881.3s)]
*  just was completely disenfranchised. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4883.860000000001s)]
*  So I don't think, I just totally think that's wrong. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4885.860000000001s)]
*  And also I think that, you know, us being, [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4889.900000000001s)]
*  I'm not even saying like we shouldn't be friends [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4893.42s)]
*  with Israel. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4895.22s)]
*  I think we should, in fact. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4896.06s)]
*  And like, I think that, I think that a few months back, [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4896.88s)]
*  I mean, after Israel killed that Iranian in Syria [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4901.38s)]
*  and Iran sent all those rockets at it, [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4905.5s)]
*  we helped defend Israel. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4907.5s)]
*  And so did Saudi Arabia and Jordan. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4909.22s)]
*  But I'm like, okay, that's somewhat reasonable [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4911.900000000001s)]
*  as far as interventions go. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4914.740000000001s)]
*  But like the idea that we're unconditionally behind Israel [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4917.06s)]
*  and do nothing, you know what I mean, for the Palestinians, [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4922.22s)]
*  I don't think that helps us at all. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4925.34s)]
*  And in fact, I think it's a huge part of the reason [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4927.34s)]
*  why we're so hated in the Muslim world. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4929.92s)]
*  But it wasn't always like that. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4932.9400000000005s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4934.900000000001s)]
*  Okay, so after World War I, [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4936.1s)]
*  they set up what's called the King-Crane Commission. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4940.660000000001s)]
*  And they went around, they were basically trying [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4944.780000000001s)]
*  to figure out what we were gonna do [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4946.54s)]
*  with some of these areas, like the Ottoman Empire. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4947.660000000001s)]
*  Ottoman Empire falls, you gotta work on this and stuff. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4949.860000000001s)]
*  Right, and they went and they surveyed [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4952.38s)]
*  like thousands and thousands of people. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4955.3s)]
*  They went to Palestine at the time, they went to Syria. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4958.1s)]
*  And Syria, they asked them who they wanted to rule them [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4960.780000000001s)]
*  in a League of Nations mandate. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4964.92s)]
*  And they overwhelmingly voted for America [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4967.2s)]
*  because there was just like this positive feeling [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4970.4800000000005s)]
*  about America in that part of the world. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4972.2s)]
*  Like it was like the French and the British they hated. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4974.2s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4976.56s)]
*  You know, because they had like been horrible to them. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4977.38s)]
*  But America was like seen as like, [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4979.64s)]
*  oh, that's the freedom people, the city on a hill. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4981.72s)]
*  Like we like those guys. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4984.52s)]
*  And so I'm not saying, whenever I bring this up, [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=4986.0s)]

*  Wars with Muslims in the region. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5275.679999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5277.88s)]
*  And basically having... [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5278.719999999999s)]
*  So there was a positive sentiment towards America [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5279.679999999999s)]
*  in the region, at least after World War I. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5283.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it was certainly much better [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5287.28s)]
*  than it has been since then. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5288.96s)]
*  And then the creation of Israel [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5290.5199999999995s)]
*  pissed off a lot of people, obviously. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5294.88s)]
*  And I'm not trying to make this a one-sided story [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5297.92s)]
*  because I do think that there's obviously been atrocities [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5301.679999999999s)]
*  committed on both sides and all of that's bad. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5305.84s)]
*  But I just like a lot of, you can go on YouTube [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5310.16s)]
*  and find like Ben Shapiro and Dennis Prager [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5315.4s)]
*  and all these guys, they have these videos. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5317.599999999999s)]
*  They'll be like, the brief history of Israel [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5319.5599999999995s)]
*  by Ben Shapiro. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5322.5199999999995s)]
*  It's like, well, the Jews wanted to start a free country [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5323.72s)]
*  and then the Arabs attacked them. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5326.48s)]
*  I'm not even exaggerating. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5328.16s)]
*  That's the story of their history. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5330.0s)]
*  And it's like, I mean, there was a middle part there [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5331.84s)]
*  that you kind of left out. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5334.72s)]
*  And I understand the need for a Jewish nation [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5335.5599999999995s)]
*  when they historically get persecuted, slaughtered, whatever. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5339.0s)]
*  I just feel like, maybe you just give them the Dakotas. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5343.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5345.879999999999s)]
*  We got some states we're not really using. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5347.12s)]
*  Have you heard a good foreign policy solution for the region [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5348.599999999999s)]
*  like that protects Israel from getting ran over by Iran [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5352.28s)]
*  or any other aggressor, but also preserves Palestinians? [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5355.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, at every point that there were [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5360.24s)]
*  meaningful negotiations, it was always basically predicated [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5362.5599999999995s)]
*  on the fact that 67 borders [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5368.639999999999s)]
*  and what they mean when they say 67 borders. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5372.84s)]
*  Basically the way it happened was as Zionist settlers [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5375.64s)]
*  before Israel was created started moving [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5383.04s)]
*  to what was known as Palestine then. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5385.24s)]
*  And they were trying to get more and more people [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5387.6s)]
*  to move there. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5389.4800000000005s)]
*  First, they had a lot of trouble getting most Jews [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5390.8s)]
*  who were like in London or New York or wherever [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5394.68s)]
*  were like, I'm an accountant and things are okay. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5397.24s)]
*  And I don't really feel like going to be a poor farmer [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5400.96s)]
*  in Palestine. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5404.0s)]
*  What is this project? [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5405.44s)]
*  After World War II and after the Nazis were defeated, [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5407.4s)]
*  it really picked up steam and a lot of people wanted to move. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5412.52s)]
*  There was a lot of, it's a really interesting history. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5417.04s)]
*  They discovered Sephardic. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5419.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, that also happened a little bit later [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5421.12s)]
*  as the Sephardic Jews all came. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5424.08s)]
*  They were kicked out of neighboring Arab countries. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5426.72s)]
*  So basically they had been working on creating [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5429.0s)]
*  a Jewish homeland there for decades. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5434.0s)]
*  And in 47 when the British basically got out of there [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5436.320000000001s)]
*  because the Jews had become terrorists [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5440.8s)]
*  and were basically drove them out of Palestine, [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5442.72s)]
*  they kicked it over to the United Nations, [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5446.84s)]
*  which is brand new. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5448.6s)]
*  And the United Nations was like, [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5449.84s)]
*  well, why don't we divide up the land? [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5450.84s)]
*  Like they made a recommendation. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5452.6s)]
*  It wasn't like the General Assembly had no authority [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5455.0s)]
*  to just like carve up countries, [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5456.84s)]
*  but they were like, this is what we recommend. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5459.4400000000005s)]
*  And they recommended that the Jews get 56% of the land [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5460.320000000001s)]
*  and the Arabs get 44% of the land. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5463.72s)]
*  And that was really not based on anything. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5466.160000000001s)]
*  I think Jews owned like 10% of the land at the time [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5469.84s)]
*  or something like that. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5472.160000000001s)]
*  So the Arabs were like, no, this is ridiculous. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5473.0s)]
*  Like this has been our home for hundreds of years, [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5475.320000000001s)]
*  thousands of years. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5477.64s)]
*  Like, no, we're not giving them the majority. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5478.68s)]
*  And then a civil war broke out [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5481.4400000000005s)]
*  and about 750,000 Palestinians were kicked out [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5484.36s)]
*  and never allowed back in. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5490.04s)]
*  And those are the people who are in Gaza [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5491.799999999999s)]
*  and the West Bank to this day. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5494.36s)]
*  Or that children and grandchildren of them. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5496.5199999999995s)]
*  And some of them are in Jordan and Lebanon and stuff. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5499.5199999999995s)]
*  And so like this, [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5502.16s)]
*  and then the neighboring Arab countries attacked, [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5503.799999999999s)]
*  they fought a war. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5507.0s)]
*  They fought a war again in the 50s, [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5507.839999999999s)]
*  they fought a war again in the 60s, [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5509.28s)]
*  they fought a war again in the 70s. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5510.839999999999s)]
*  There were major problems that came along. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5513.08s)]
*  And it's a very rich history with a lot of this side story [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5515.5599999999995s)]
*  or this side story. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5520.32s)]
*  But you could at least grant that, [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5521.719999999999s)]
*  unlike what Ben Shapiro and Dennis Prager say [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5524.08s)]
*  in their videos, [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5526.08s)]
*  that there is a Palestinian side to this story [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5526.92s)]
*  where like a lot of those people were genuinely wronged. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5529.88s)]
*  And yes, there were some Palestinians [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5532.5599999999995s)]
*  who embraced terrorism pretty early on. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5534.639999999999s)]
*  It was a very bad strategy for them, [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5537.16s)]
*  has not worked out well for their people, [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5539.599999999999s)]
*  and also is just horrible and wrong. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5541.72s)]
*  But America ultimately coming into this, [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5544.56s)]
*  which the US was not at first, [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5549.280000000001s)]
*  but ultimately deciding that we will be unconditionally [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5551.84s)]
*  on one side of this conflict, [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5554.6s)]
*  I think was not smart or fair or wise. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5556.76s)]
*  And how did that happen? [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5561.88s)]
*  Was that APEC even back then? [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5562.72s)]
*  Do you know? [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5565.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't know exactly. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5566.240000000001s)]
*  There was a lot of interesting stuff [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5570.68s)]
*  kind of behind the scenes. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5573.56s)]
*  I don't know exactly. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5574.4800000000005s)]
*  I know that there was definitely [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5575.8s)]
*  some blackmail stuff going on. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5578.280000000001s)]
*  The Ben Gurion was definitely at least attempting [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5581.04s)]
*  to blackmail Alan Dulles for a while. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5584.200000000001s)]
*  This was in the 60s, who's the head of the CIA here. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5586.68s)]
*  Oh, Dulles Airport, right? [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5589.56s)]
*  I believe the airport is named after his brother. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5591.320000000001s)]
*  But check on that. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5595.240000000001s)]
*  His brother was Secretary of State, I believe. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5596.08s)]
*  I think they wouldn't name the airport [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5598.5199999999995s)]
*  after the CIA director. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5599.879999999999s)]
*  That would just be too in our face. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5601.2s)]
*  Like what? [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5603.28s)]
*  You get an airport? [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5604.16s)]
*  But whatever, they worked pretty closely together. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5605.4s)]
*  Yeah, tell me who's the airport named after? [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5607.24s)]
*  John Dulles. John Dulles, yeah. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5609.16s)]
*  He was the Secretary of State, I believe. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5610.44s)]
*  Alan Dulles was the CIA guy. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5612.04s)]
*  But I don't know exactly. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5615.0s)]
*  I'd have to brush up on when exactly APEC was created [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5617.879999999999s)]
*  and how much, when they gained all their influence. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5621.28s)]
*  But one way or the other, [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5623.959999999999s)]
*  they ended up getting American support. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5625.16s)]
*  And I don't think that's been good for anyone involved, [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5627.04s)]
*  including Israel. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5629.96s)]
*  There's a weird thing, [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5631.28s)]
*  it's kind of like being on welfare isn't good for you. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5632.44s)]
*  If you're able-bodied, you can work. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5635.28s)]
*  And it's kind of like there's this moral hazard [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5637.32s)]
*  that comes along with being dependent [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5639.44s)]
*  on someone in perpetuity. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5644.76s)]
*  You don't learn to be your own. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5646.48s)]
*  Like, no, the actual healthy thing would be like, [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5647.8s)]
*  hey, if you're gonna create a nation here, [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5649.96s)]
*  then you gotta get along with your neighbors. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5651.24s)]
*  You gotta know the repercussions of your actions. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5653.08s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta work out your own balance. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5654.12s)]
*  There's no repercussions when you're hanging with the boys. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5656.24s)]
*  And also, and this is one of the major problems [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5659.44s)]
*  in Ukraine too, is that when the biggest, [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5661.2s)]
*  baddest country in the history of the world, [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5663.76s)]
*  the United States of America, goes, we got your back, [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5665.4s)]
*  you end up getting a lot ballsier [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5668.36s)]
*  than you otherwise would be. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5669.96s)]
*  You're like, okay, well, I'm gonna go start a fight [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5671.5599999999995s)]
*  because my big brother will come bail me out. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5673.8s)]
*  And it's like, no, you should actually only start a fight [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5676.04s)]
*  that you actually think you could win without us. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5679.04s)]
*  What do you think the resolution of that will be, [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5681.08s)]
*  Russia-Ukraine? [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5683.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, I mean, I think it's ultimately gonna be essentially [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5685.48s)]
*  what the peace deal that was on the table [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5688.959999999999s)]
*  at the very beginning that they made them squash, [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5690.799999999999s)]
*  which is that Russia's gonna keep parts of it. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5693.08s)]
*  Russia keeps parts of it, NATO doesn't get in, [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5695.759999999999s)]
*  military industrial complex makes billions of dollars. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5698.0s)]
*  Everybody's happy. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5700.759999999999s)]
*  So where we started? [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5701.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, everybody except the Ukrainians. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5702.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, everybody's happy except the Ukrainians, [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5704.639999999999s)]
*  but what's interesting is if they accept the deal, [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5706.959999999999s)]
*  then the military industrial complex [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5710.08s)]
*  doesn't make billions of dollars. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5712.36s)]
*  So we gotta stretch this out so that they can cash in [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5713.72s)]
*  a little bit. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5717.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting to look at. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5718.64s)]
*  What's that? [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5719.96s)]
*  No, can you ask on the Israel side, like what's the, [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5720.8s)]
*  is there no solutions or it's trade-offs? [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5723.040000000001s)]
*  What's the short term and the medium term [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5725.64s)]
*  that you could think would be agreed upon? [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5728.240000000001s)]
*  Let me, I'll do long term first almost is what I would do, [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5731.52s)]
*  which is again, it's like this similar thing with Ukraine. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5735.280000000001s)]
*  It's like, what's frustrating about all of this [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5737.4400000000005s)]
*  is that it's kind of like, I'm not saying like [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5738.88s)]
*  every precise detail is known, [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5740.64s)]
*  but the broad strokes is obviously there. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5742.48s)]
*  So look, so the UN recommends 56% for the state of Israel. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5745.44s)]
*  Then they go to war, Israel wins the war, [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5754.28s)]
*  and they don't just take that 56%, [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5757.28s)]
*  they take 78% of the land. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5759.4s)]
*  Then in 1967, they go to war with Egypt and Jordan, [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5762.599999999999s)]
*  they win again, and then they take 100% of the land. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5765.959999999999s)]
*  So the last 22% is really what we're talking about, [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5769.08s)]
*  which is Gaza and the West Bank. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5773.32s)]
*  Every single peace deal that's ever been on the table, [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5776.08s)]
*  and I'm not saying what the craziest leader of Hamas [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5778.4s)]
*  yells on social media or something, [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5781.28s)]
*  but when they actually sat down in the Oslo Accords, [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5783.16s)]
*  at Camp David, at any of this, [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5786.879999999999s)]
*  it was always about that last 22%, [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5788.24s)]
*  which that's what they mean when they say 67 borders, [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5790.12s)]
*  is they're like, okay, you get the 78%. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5792.719999999999s)]
*  Not the 56% that you were supposed to have [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5795.2s)]
*  in the beginning that we didn't even think was fair back then. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5797.679999999999s)]
*  Not the 78%, you get that, but give us our last 22%. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5799.96s)]
*  That's the deal. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5804.6s)]
*  67 borders. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5805.6s)]
*  Going back to you saying they went to war, [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5806.44s)]
*  when you go 67, when you go 73, [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5808.84s)]
*  when there is a war that happens, [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5810.68s)]
*  it's like why do we get to go back to the negotiating table [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5812.24s)]
*  after Israel won and say, all right, sorry about that, [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5815.36s)]
*  let's go back to this negotiating table. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5819.64s)]
*  I understand that perspective, [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5821.64s)]
*  yesterday's price is not today's price, 100%, [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5823.4800000000005s)]
*  but I think according to international law, [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5826.2s)]
*  you cannot take more land due to war or conflict. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5829.12s)]
*  I think that's what- [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5833.72s)]
*  There's a lot of international laws, [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5834.5599999999995s)]
*  you're also not allowed to do settlements. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5836.24s)]
*  But I also get that sentiment. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5838.599999999999s)]
*  We're occupying this land, you keep attacking us, [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5841.2s)]
*  all right, well then it's gonna be ours. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5843.12s)]
*  I get that feeling. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5844.24s)]
*  Okay, fine. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5845.2s)]
*  Can you tell us the laws though that- [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5846.04s)]
*  Well, okay, so it is, [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5847.28s)]
*  I'm not an expert on international law, [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5849.24s)]
*  but the settlements are definitely illegal, [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5850.76s)]
*  you're not allowed to transfer your population [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5853.5599999999995s)]
*  into occupied territory, which they continue to do [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5855.5599999999995s)]
*  in the West Bank. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5858.24s)]
*  And yes, I do think that Andrew's right, [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5859.36s)]
*  that you're not really allowed to seize land from a war. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5861.8s)]
*  I mean, this idea is like a very, [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5866.0s)]
*  this is the old order, the whole reason [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5868.08s)]
*  why we have international law, [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5871.28s)]
*  is that you can't just go win a war [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5873.0s)]
*  and then say your land is ours. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5874.88s)]
*  But the problem beyond that is that [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5876.6s)]
*  it's not like Israel conquered Gaza [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5879.2s)]
*  and made it part of Israel, [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5881.6s)]
*  or conquered the West Bank and made it part of Israel, [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5883.0s)]
*  they're just conquering it and holding the people there. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5885.44s)]
*  Forever. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5888.4400000000005s)]
*  And this is just, it's an unsustainable system. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5889.280000000001s)]
*  And the only, look, nobody, I shouldn't say nobody, [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5891.8s)]
*  but I'm not saying, [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5895.72s)]
*  and whenever any of these real negotiations were happening, [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5897.68s)]
*  it's not the claim is like, [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5901.280000000001s)]
*  you all have to go back to Europe, [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5902.6s)]
*  or you all have to go live somewhere else, [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5904.8s)]
*  that's obviously a non-starter. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5906.400000000001s)]
*  All this from the river to the sea stuff [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5908.320000000001s)]
*  is not helpful at all. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5910.12s)]
*  But I do think the obvious thing is that like, [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5911.96s)]
*  look, you got five million Palestinians living in this land, [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5915.68s)]
*  they have to get to have something. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5918.64s)]
*  And it shouldn't be Israel's decision even. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5920.400000000001s)]
*  Like why do you decide whether they get to have [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5922.84s)]
*  their own government or they get to, [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5925.200000000001s)]
*  it's like they should have their independence. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5927.64s)]
*  Let's say that there is a agreement reached, right? [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5928.8s)]
*  And it's, they get the 22%, it's back to whatever, [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5931.4400000000005s)]
*  what is it, 67 borders or? [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5934.400000000001s)]
*  Okay, 67 borders, whatever that is. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5936.0s)]
*  How does Israel protect itself [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5938.84s)]
*  from another version of Hamas coming in and saying, [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5941.0s)]
*  hey, you know what, we don't want those. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5944.16s)]
*  We don't want that agreement. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5945.92s)]
*  Actually we want 46%. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5947.0s)]
*  Actually we want 55%. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5948.84s)]
*  We want river to the sea. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5950.5599999999995s)]
*  What are they supposed to do if they just relinquish [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5951.72s)]
*  total power in a vacuum, what would happen? [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5954.599999999999s)]
*  So this is, I always love this quote, [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5956.48s)]
*  which I think I always butcher, [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5959.48s)]
*  but there's a quote from Thomas Jefferson, [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5961.12s)]
*  where he's talking about slavery. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5964.44s)]
*  And he said, we have the wolf by the ear, [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5966.36s)]
*  and we can neither afford to hold onto it [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5970.84s)]
*  nor to safely let it go. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5976.0s)]
*  And essentially what the big concern was is like, [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5978.52s)]
*  okay, these abolitionists are saying slavery is wrong, [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5981.360000000001s)]
*  but like, I mean, if we just release these slaves, [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5983.8s)]
*  they're gonna come kill us. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5987.360000000001s)]
*  We've been enslaving these people forever. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5988.56s)]
*  We've done horrible things to them. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5991.0s)]
*  Like if we let them go now, they're gonna all come kill us. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5992.64s)]
*  And you can understand where like that was a concern [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5995.0s)]
*  at the time and it's somewhat reasonable one. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=5999.08s)]
*  But in hindsight, if you look at it [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6001.76s)]
*  with the moral clarity from like 2000, [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6004.32s)]
*  yeah, you can't enslave people. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6006.2s)]
*  I don't know, like that's just not an option. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6007.8s)]
*  So you just can't, so if that were to happen. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6009.88s)]
*  So you're saying they have to assume the risk? [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6011.96s)]
*  Well, yes, I'm saying that if Israel [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6013.24s)]
*  were to give Palestinian independence [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6015.5199999999995s)]
*  and then the Palestinians attacked Israel, [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6018.12s)]
*  we'd be having a different conversation at that point. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6021.16s)]
*  But the fear of that is not enough to justify [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6024.0s)]
*  keeping people in such a situation. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6028.04s)]
*  And what would that conversation be, do you think? [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6029.36s)]
*  Well, I mean, look, the other thing about this, [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6031.24s)]
*  I'll just say is that there's a lot of reason to think [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6033.5199999999995s)]
*  that that wouldn't be the case. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6036.08s)]
*  And that look, like when there were peace negotiations [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6038.32s)]
*  going on, there was a lot of support [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6042.44s)]
*  behind the Palestinian authority. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6045.68s)]
*  And when the peace negotiations collapsed, [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6048.0s)]
*  Hamas's support went through the roof. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6051.48s)]
*  And it's almost like the more desperate people are, [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6053.48s)]
*  the more they're like, oh, let's go blow something up. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6056.44s)]
*  Whereas if they think there's actually hope [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6059.28s)]
*  and there's actually a chance for prosperity [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6061.24s)]
*  and a better life, they're much more likely [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6063.08s)]
*  to not engage in that. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6065.12s)]
*  Now I'm not saying that's a guarantee. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6066.4s)]
*  If I were Israel, I wouldn't disarm tomorrow, [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6067.799999999999s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6070.16s)]
*  Like Israel's got a pretty bad ass military. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6071.12s)]
*  It is still hard to believe that they allowed [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6073.44s)]
*  October 7th to happen in the way they did. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6077.919999999999s)]
*  I'm not speculating about anything. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6079.879999999999s)]
*  I don't really have any solid evidence on any of that. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6082.12s)]
*  But if you know anything about Israel [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6084.76s)]
*  and how much of a fortress it is and how prepared they are, [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6088.04s)]
*  the wait time just makes no sense. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6092.360000000001s)]
*  It's a tiny country. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6094.8s)]
*  But they could pretty easily just not let that happen again [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6097.24s)]
*  and have solid border security. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6101.4800000000005s)]
*  But that would be, I think, I think ultimately that has to be. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6104.92s)]
*  But border security was, besides that, [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6107.92s)]
*  and I won't even speak on the West Bank side, [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6110.4400000000005s)]
*  that's a complicated thing. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6112.76s)]
*  The hard right has always said, if there was a two state, [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6114.72s)]
*  it's Gaza. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6118.360000000001s)]
*  It's not also the West Bank. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6118.96s)]
*  But you have Gaza, thousands of rockets for years. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6120.96s)]
*  So what's the border security? [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6124.96s)]
*  Do you believe that had there been just real peace, [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6126.32s)]
*  at least from Gaza, over years and years and years, [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6130.2s)]
*  the way that they took away all the permits for all the workers [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6133.52s)]
*  that would come daily, do you believe [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6136.0s)]
*  that Israel would try to be, quote unquote, enslaving them? [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6137.72s)]
*  Or do you think, hey, build it up, [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6141.16s)]
*  let the money come in properly, not go into Hamas' kids, [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6143.16s)]
*  billions of dollars? [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6149.16s)]
*  I truly believe the same way we made a deal with the Abraham [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6150.68s)]
*  Accords, and within one year, a million Israelis [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6154.84s)]
*  went to the Emirates. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6158.32s)]
*  They were dying to create business, to spend their money. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6160.36s)]
*  I truly believe that if just not West Bank, I'm talking Gaza, [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6163.96s)]
*  if there was peace, there would have been [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6167.36s)]
*  that exact same sentiment. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6169.12s)]
*  And I think that that's what Israelis are like. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6170.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, yeah, but I mean, it's kind of, look, [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6172.56s)]
*  I mean, Israel wasn't occupying, or if you don't like the word [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6175.400000000001s)]
*  occupying, wasn't dominating any of those countries. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6179.76s)]
*  And so the idea that you're going to, like, I mean, [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6183.320000000001s)]
*  first of all, just the point you made about the money [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6185.92s)]
*  not going right into Hamas' coffers, [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6188.8s)]
*  to be clear, Israel won't let sugar or potatoes [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6190.6s)]
*  or all types of humanitarian aid into Gaza. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6194.56s)]
*  But they would facilitate cash payments [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6198.04s)]
*  to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6200.64s)]
*  directly to Hamas, because actually, that [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6202.88s)]
*  was the big secret that Benjamin Netanyahu was intentionally [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6205.84s)]
*  keeping Hamas in power in Gaza. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6209.04s)]
*  But I don't think the standard can be, [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6212.320000000001s)]
*  we're going to dominate you and keep you in grinding poverty, [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6214.84s)]
*  and then with impunity whenever we want to go on these, [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6219.280000000001s)]
*  like, bombing campaigns. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6222.400000000001s)]
*  I'm talking pre-October 7th, like, this has just [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6223.4400000000005s)]
*  been the status quo in Gaza, and you [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6225.68s)]
*  got to stop firing your rockets back at us. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6228.2s)]
*  And as soon as you start acting peaceful, [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6230.679999999999s)]
*  then we will tell you that we will allow you. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6233.08s)]
*  Which order did that happen in? [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6235.88s)]
*  If Brooklyn is firing rockets into Manhattan for years [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6237.08s)]
*  and years, like, they're going to respond. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6241.08s)]
*  I don't think that there were bombing campaigns without. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6242.8s)]
*  But now we're getting into chicken and the egg. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6245.8s)]
*  For sure. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6247.32s)]
*  And in order to do that, we have to go back to, what, 1921? [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6248.12s)]
*  But we keep going back, and I'm like, what's the next? [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6252.2s)]
*  Well, listen, I grant you that it's [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6253.92s)]
*  hard to say when you go with each one of these things, [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6256.2s)]
*  you go, well, which was a response to which, right? [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6259.76s)]
*  But if I'm just being honest here, [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6262.44s)]
*  you go, this was a response to that, which was a response [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6265.96s)]
*  to that, which was a response to that, which was a response [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6268.5199999999995s)]
*  to a bunch of Eastern Europeans moving to a land [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6271.04s)]
*  they didn't inhabit and kicking hundreds of thousands [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6273.2s)]
*  of the people they're at. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6275.24s)]
*  Like, that's really the first thing [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6277.0s)]
*  that this is a response to. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6279.2s)]
*  And it's just kind of hard to get away from that. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6280.599999999999s)]
*  Now, again, I'm not saying that means Jews are going away [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6282.599999999999s)]
*  anytime soon. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6285.68s)]
*  It's just like, look, the Native Americans, [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6287.16s)]
*  that problem here is solved, pretty much. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6289.64s)]
*  But if we were talking back about like- [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6293.56s)]
*  The old fashions. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6294.96s)]
*  Yes. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6295.8s)]
*  Sure. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6296.6s)]
*  But I'm just saying, if we went back to, well, look, [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6297.96s)]
*  were there instances where Native Americans attacked, [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6302.52s)]
*  you know what I mean, settlers, and then they were responding? [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6305.56s)]
*  Sure. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6308.0s)]
*  But what was the first thing? [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6308.8s)]
*  The first thing was us coming over here. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6310.04s)]
*  For sure. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6312.4400000000005s)]
*  And so now, to the degree that there are still [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6313.44s)]
*  Native Americans around- [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6315.679999999999s)]
*  But you could make the argument that there [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6316.96s)]
*  were always Jews there. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6320.04s)]
*  Even though these Eastern European Jews came, [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6321.48s)]
*  there were Jews that were- [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6323.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, there was always a small population. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6324.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6326.5199999999995s)]
*  And part of the reason why- [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6327.0s)]
*  And there were no Americans here when the Natives were here. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6328.16s)]
*  That's why I think it's a little different. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6331.5199999999995s)]
*  Fair enough. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6333.36s)]
*  But look, the Jews there also did, [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6334.639999999999s)]
*  pre-Zionism, live in relative harmony with the Arabs. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6337.24s)]
*  I mean, if one of the reasons- [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6341.2s)]
*  Back and forth on this. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6342.48s)]
*  I've heard, like, because, and I know everybody [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6343.36s)]
*  uses their own arguments, but like, [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6345.36s)]
*  there's going to be a skirmish. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6347.96s)]
*  Does that skirmish, and maybe that's too reductive, [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6349.28s)]
*  define the entirety of the relationship? [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6352.28s)]
*  If there's 100 years of peace and then this horrible thing [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6355.44s)]
*  happens, does that mean it was horrible the whole time? [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6358.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6360.12s)]
*  But I have heard both arguments. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6360.5199999999995s)]
*  The early Zionists even said it was part of the reason why [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6362.76s)]
*  they wanted to make their homeland in Palestine. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6365.76s)]
*  Because it was so welcoming. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6369.4s)]
*  Well, because, well, I mean, I don't know if I'd say [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6370.4s)]
*  so welcoming, but relatively speaking, [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6373.08s)]
*  the Ottomans and the Arabs had been better friends [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6375.839999999999s)]
*  to the Jews than the Europeans had been. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6378.839999999999s)]
*  That was really where they dealt with the brunt of their- [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6381.04s)]
*  So maybe the argument shouldn't be that they had this, [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6384.4s)]
*  like, amazing relationship. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6386.92s)]
*  Maybe the argument is, it's better than them [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6388.5199999999995s)]
*  white people were treating us. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6390.599999999999s)]
*  Basically. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6391.719999999999s)]
*  It's everything is compared to what. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6392.32s)]
*  Yes. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6393.759999999999s)]
*  That's better. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6394.599999999999s)]
*  I think that's more digestible. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6395.16s)]
*  Because I've been kind of told there's this, [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6396.44s)]
*  maybe it's propaganda that like during, [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6400.88s)]
*  I've probably even regurgitated it, [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6402.84s)]
*  during the Ottoman Empire, the Jews flourished [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6404.24s)]
*  with the Ottomans and they were best friends. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6407.08s)]
*  I'm like, oh, it must have been harmony. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6409.08s)]
*  See, I was saying pre-Zionism. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6411.48s)]
*  Because during the Ottoman Empire also was, [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6413.28s)]
*  this is kind of, I mean, it depends on what point [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6415.8s)]
*  during the Ottoman Empire you're talking about. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6418.24s)]
*  Because I think that it's like 400 years. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6420.28s)]
*  500 years, yeah. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6421.96s)]
*  So it's more like, the problems, [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6423.0s)]
*  at least from my understanding of this, [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6427.32s)]
*  the problems got worse and worse as kind of like [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6430.04s)]
*  the Zionist experiment got more and more aggressive. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6434.44s)]
*  And there were a lot of mistakes made along the way. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6437.24s)]
*  There's one figure in Zionism who I find is my favorite, [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6439.32s)]
*  was a Hime Weizmann, who was like, [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6443.4s)]
*  did you know who that is? [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6446.72s)]
*  So he was like kind of the godfather of Zionism [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6447.92s)]
*  for a little bit there. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6450.88s)]
*  For Hercel. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6451.8s)]
*  No, no, no, after Hercel, but like before Ben-Gurion. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6452.72s)]
*  So he was almost supposed to be David Ben-Gurion, [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6456.48s)]
*  who ultimately became the first prime minister of that. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6458.84s)]
*  He was like ahead of him in position. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6461.0s)]
*  And he's been, I know it was, yep, that's him. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6463.32s)]
*  That's that Jew. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6467.28s)]
*  That's Colonel Sanders, he makes chicken out of it. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6468.84s)]
*  Well, he went on to make some very tasty chicken. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6471.24s)]
*  Of course, he changed his name by that point. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6473.16s)]
*  But so he was, I know it was Darrell Cooper, [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6476.12s)]
*  who did this amazing podcast series. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6479.56s)]
*  It's basically a book on tape. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6484.76s)]
*  But it's like the best, man, [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6486.4s)]
*  it's like 30 hours long or something like that. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6487.679999999999s)]
*  But if you really wanna understand the history [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6489.879999999999s)]
*  of the conflict, it's the best thing to listen to. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6492.679999999999s)]
*  It's just brilliant guy. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6494.879999999999s)]
*  But he said that he calls him the last humanist Zionist. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6497.04s)]
*  But so Hime Weizmann's whole theory was that like, [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6500.879999999999s)]
*  look, if this is gonna work, [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6504.759999999999s)]
*  there's only one way it's gonna work, [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6506.28s)]
*  which is that we have to just smother [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6508.4s)]
*  these Arabs with kindness. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6513.5599999999995s)]
*  And we gotta bring all this investment in [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6515.92s)]
*  and make their lives so much better [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6518.280000000001s)]
*  than their lives were before we got here. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6520.320000000001s)]
*  And that's the only way that we're actually gonna have [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6522.400000000001s)]
*  a meaningful, sustainable homeland [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6524.72s)]
*  where we're not at war with our neighbors. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6527.6s)]
*  And this was fairly, this was swallowed [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6529.56s)]
*  by the Zionists for a while. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6534.2s)]
*  And it was really after World War II [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6535.400000000001s)]
*  when Ben Gurion and all these other guys, [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6538.04s)]
*  Menachem Begin and these guys, [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6541.08s)]
*  were like, no, no, no, you're living in, [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6542.72s)]
*  you can almost hear it from an American perspective. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6544.72s)]
*  They go, you're living in a pre-Holocaust world. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6546.84s)]
*  Like the same way they'd say pre-911 world. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6549.72s)]
*  Like it was almost like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6552.56s)]
*  That was all nice and good before. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6554.320000000001s)]
*  But these guys just tried to exterminate us. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6556.52s)]
*  So now we're gonna take what's ours [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6559.2s)]
*  and we're gonna do it by any means necessary. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6561.68s)]
*  And we gotta embrace terrorism to kick the British out. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6563.96s)]
*  And you could see, you're talking like 1946, 1947. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6566.400000000001s)]
*  It's Martin and Malcolm. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6569.8s)]
*  Look, America just dropped two nukes [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6571.64s)]
*  on Japanese cities. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6573.72s)]
*  We just burned Germany to the ground. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6574.84s)]
*  Who the hell, they just got Holocausted. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6576.72s)]
*  Who the hell is anyone to tell us [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6578.76s)]
*  that we're not allowed to break a few eggs [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6580.88s)]
*  in order to make what we wanna make? [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6583.88s)]
*  So, and by the way, like as a Jewish person, [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6585.360000000001s)]
*  like I'm sympathetic to that. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6587.56s)]
*  I understand that mentality. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6589.68s)]
*  But at the same time, you could also go [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6591.52s)]
*  from the perspective of Palestinian Arabs, [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6593.400000000001s)]
*  you're like, hey, we didn't do that. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6596.52s)]
*  Like that wasn't us. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6598.92s)]
*  Like why are we paying the price [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6600.12s)]
*  for what like some Europeans did to you? [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6602.8s)]
*  Like hey, carve up a part of Germany [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6605.12s)]
*  and give it to them if that's what happened. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6606.64s)]
*  Like why are we the ones? [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6608.2s)]
*  These people didn't try to exterminate us. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6609.320000000001s)]
*  Those people tried to exterminate us. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6611.12s)]
*  Right, so there's, you know, [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6612.6s)]
*  it's just like the tragedy of history. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6614.16s)]
*  You know like on every sitcom ever [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6616.52s)]
*  where they would like tease the couple [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6618.52s)]
*  that's supposed to get together. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6620.16s)]
*  Like this was our childhood was always like, [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6621.92s)]
*  you know, like, yeah, Rosalind Rachel, [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6623.92s)]
*  they're about to get together. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6625.320000000001s)]
*  Then, ah, she got the wrong message. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6626.28s)]
*  And now it's two more years until they get, you know, [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6628.2s)]
*  it's always like, you guys were right here [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6630.96s)]
*  just to make this work. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6633.16s)]
*  And so I just think the whole thing [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6635.0s)]
*  could have gone a lot better. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6636.84s)]
*  But for us to be a country thousands of miles away, [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6638.36s)]
*  to not be like, listen, if you're, you know, [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6641.8s)]
*  if your family member was killed on October 7th, [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6644.32s)]
*  I'm not gonna sit there and talk to someone [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6647.6s)]
*  and be like, you really shouldn't be leveling Gaza right now [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6649.2s)]
*  because I know if my family was killed on the, [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6651.4400000000005s)]
*  I'd be, I'd be, I mean, I think especially like, [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6654.08s)]
*  you got a kid now, man. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6657.6s)]
*  It's like, when you have kids, you kind of like, [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6659.0s)]
*  you understand a different level of that. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6661.08s)]
*  I mean, you could always understand like your friend [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6663.1s)]
*  or like someone, or like your parents [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6665.26s)]
*  or something like that. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6667.12s)]
*  But you're like, I mean, like I got two little kids, [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6668.08s)]
*  like, dude, if someone hurt one of my kids, [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6670.08s)]
*  just the levels of evil that I could sink to, [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6674.36s)]
*  it's really not very hard for me to get there. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6677.48s)]
*  But like, as soon as I start thinking about it, [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6679.36s)]
*  I'm like, kill anything that moves. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6681.74s)]
*  Kill anything. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6683.88s)]
*  And so I totally understand that. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6684.88s)]
*  It makes you understand your behavior way better. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6686.44s)]
*  But this was the worst versions of it. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6689.0s)]
*  So, you know, what originally woke me up, [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6690.679999999999s)]
*  got me really interested in politics [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6693.599999999999s)]
*  was Ron Paul's presidential campaign in 2008. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6695.28s)]
*  And this was the point that he made. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6698.719999999999s)]
*  I don't know if you've ever seen this video, [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6700.28s)]
*  it was Ron Paul versus Rudy Giuliani. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6701.48s)]
*  And it was in George W. Bush's Republican Party. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6703.799999999999s)]
*  If you're like, for younger people, [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6706.839999999999s)]
*  I know there's a lot of younger people [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6708.24s)]
*  who listen to this show. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6709.32s)]
*  And I think like, I don't know if you could fully appreciate [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6710.36s)]
*  what the culture of America was like post 9-11 [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6713.28s)]
*  when George W. Bush was president. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6716.5199999999995s)]
*  And the whole tone of it was like, [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6718.36s)]
*  it's like, look, you're either with us [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6720.5599999999995s)]
*  or you're with the terrorists. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6721.679999999999s)]
*  By the way, the reason they hate us is because we're free. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6722.88s)]
*  That's their beef with us, is that we're free. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6725.4s)]
*  So what can you do with that? [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6728.0s)]
*  You really can't do nothing. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6729.5199999999995s)]
*  And they're gonna hear from us real soon. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6730.5199999999995s)]
*  So we're gonna explode them all to death [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6732.04s)]
*  because what the hell else can you do with that? [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6733.719999999999s)]
*  And Ron Paul got up and he was like, [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6735.4s)]
*  look, they don't hate us because we're free. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6737.36s)]
*  They hate us because we're over there. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6739.24s)]
*  That's why they're coming over here. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6741.32s)]
*  And so there was this thing where it's almost like, [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6743.12s)]
*  it reminded you how, like these aren't his words, [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6745.08s)]
*  they're my words, but like, it's like, okay, [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6748.36s)]
*  so you know how 9-11 happened? [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6750.679999999999s)]
*  And then immediately we were all like, [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6752.48s)]
*  we're gonna go kill you guys. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6754.12s)]
*  It's like, yeah, that's how they feel too. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6756.28s)]
*  That's like exactly how they feel. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6759.12s)]
*  And so I do think there's something where it's like, [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6760.5599999999995s)]
*  right, so the same way that if you're an Israeli [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6763.12s)]
*  after October 7th, you're like, [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6765.32s)]
*  burn this whole thing to the ground. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6767.0s)]
*  It's like, yeah, but I think that's also the mentality [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6769.04s)]
*  of all those people. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6771.4s)]
*  And then weirdly, they'll sit there and they'll go, [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6773.32s)]
*  they'll be like, well, of course we have to burn [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6774.96s)]
*  all of Gaza to the ground. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6776.12s)]
*  Did you see the videos of them cheering after October 7th? [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6777.719999999999s)]
*  And you're like, yeah, but I think they're kind of doing [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6782.04s)]
*  the same thing you're doing right now. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6784.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6785.799999999999s)]
*  Like, did you see Nikki Haley went over there [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6786.719999999999s)]
*  and she's signing bombs? [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6788.2s)]
*  What a face. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6790.0s)]
*  She's like, yo, how fucking sick and twisted is that? [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6790.839999999999s)]
*  That's like the darkest thing I've ever seen in my life. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6795.2s)]
*  And then the same people who will see that go, [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6797.32s)]
*  and did you see, they were greeting the people [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6799.799999999999s)]
*  on October 7th like they were heroes when they came back. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6801.84s)]
*  And you're like, that is also pretty sick and twisted. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6804.2s)]
*  Yeah, all of this is pretty sick and twisted. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6806.24s)]
*  I think you guys actually have a lot in common. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6808.76s)]
*  I'm being honest. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6810.96s)]
*  I was just, startling similarity. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6811.8s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6815.12s)]
*  We hear this name nonstop. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6819.08s)]
*  Pretty sure he's a Jew. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6820.56s)]
*  But who is he? [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6823.12s)]
*  Do you think that he's net negative, net positive [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6825.4800000000005s)]
*  for Israel? [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6828.68s)]
*  Like, what is? [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6830.64s)]
*  Unbelievable net negative. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6831.48s)]
*  And then, so what is he inspired by? [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6832.84s)]
*  What is he motivated by? [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6834.5199999999995s)]
*  Is this personal interest? [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6835.6s)]
*  Does he have a group that is pushing him [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6837.68s)]
*  in a certain direction? [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6839.72s)]
*  I'm so removed from it. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6841.32s)]
*  I don't even know what to think about this person. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6843.5199999999995s)]
*  So maybe like a little. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6845.4s)]
*  Okay, so he's a member of the Likud party. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6846.6s)]
*  Isn't this a recent thing though, [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6849.64s)]
*  that he's a member of Likud? [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6850.92s)]
*  Didn't he have to partner up with them? [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6851.96s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6853.5199999999995s)]
*  He's a member of Likud, but then they've partnered [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6854.36s)]
*  with people who are like a click to the right [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6856.6s)]
*  of the Likud party. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6858.6s)]
*  So essentially. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6860.200000000001s)]
*  And it's a parliamentary system, [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6861.04s)]
*  so they need as many people as they can. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6861.92s)]
*  And in this kind of somewhat ironic and tragic thing, [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6865.96s)]
*  so like when he was, before October 7th, [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6870.12s)]
*  he had huge protests against him out in the streets [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6873.280000000001s)]
*  because they were trying to like crack down [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6875.64s)]
*  on the power of their Supreme Court [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6877.68s)]
*  to give him more power essentially. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6879.92s)]
*  30 weeks in a row. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6882.0s)]
*  And then October 7th brought everyone together. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6883.200000000001s)]
*  Against Netanyahu. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6885.76s)]
*  For 30 weeks. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6887.6s)]
*  And so now if you could imagine, right, [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6888.44s)]
*  in this parliamentary system, [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6890.639999999999s)]
*  all the liberals are furious at him. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6892.639999999999s)]
*  But now what does that have the effect of, [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6894.96s)]
*  politically for Netanyahu? [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6896.599999999999s)]
*  Then the only alliance left for him [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6898.12s)]
*  is everyone to the right. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6900.28s)]
*  So he's now got to cater to these extreme right groups, [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6901.679999999999s)]
*  even far to the right of the Likud. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6904.599999999999s)]
*  And so anyway, the Likud party was founded [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6908.879999999999s)]
*  by Menachem Begin, who was one of the terrorists [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6911.0s)]
*  before the creation of Israel, [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6917.0s)]
*  and a brutal one at that. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6919.16s)]
*  And anyone can go look this up, [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6921.32s)]
*  this isn't like a pejorative, [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6922.76s)]
*  like this is, they said in their own words [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6923.84s)]
*  that they were embracing terrorism. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6926.92s)]
*  But anyway, so the Netanyahu doctrine, [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6929.32s)]
*  as it's been described, [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6933.76s)]
*  was essentially as you talked about [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6936.36s)]
*  the Abraham Accords earlier. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6937.92s)]
*  So when I was a kid, [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6940.08s)]
*  Yitzhak Rabin was the prime minister of Israel, [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6944.48s)]
*  and he embarked on what are known as the Oslo Accords, [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6947.4s)]
*  the peace process. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6951.879999999999s)]
*  And essentially, I mean, [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6953.2s)]
*  the Israelis had committed back in the 70s, okay? [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6954.5599999999995s)]
*  So the 70s they had a meeting at Camp David, [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6957.639999999999s)]
*  and Israel vaguely, if you could think 1967, [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6960.5199999999995s)]
*  they took over Gaza and the West Bank. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6964.839999999999s)]
*  By the 70s, the US was kind of like, [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6967.0s)]
*  listen, we're gonna give you in perpetuity [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6969.599999999999s)]
*  billions of dollars every year, [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6973.68s)]
*  we're also gonna give Egypt billions of dollars every year. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6974.96s)]
*  This was basically like, we're gonna bribe you guys [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6977.4800000000005s)]
*  to not go to war anymore, okay? [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6979.84s)]
*  So like, you guys make a freaking deal, [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6981.64s)]
*  because you've been to war four times in 25 years, [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6984.320000000001s)]
*  or whatever it was. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6986.88s)]
*  So it's like, okay, you gotta stop. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6987.72s)]
*  And then it was kind of thrown in there like, [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6989.92s)]
*  and by the way, you gotta eventually [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6991.84s)]
*  give the Palestinians a state, [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6994.56s)]
*  like you can't just rule them forever. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6996.0s)]
*  And they kind of agreed to that. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6997.160000000001s)]
*  So in the 90s, this was supposed to be, [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=6998.52s)]
*  oh, they're finally doing it. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7000.320000000001s)]
*  And then Yitzhak Rabin and Arafat and Bill Clinton [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7001.72s)]
*  took pictures together and did all. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7007.280000000001s)]
*  And these were good faith negotiations, [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7009.0s)]
*  or both sides were. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7011.0s)]
*  It's politics. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7012.4800000000005s)]
*  So it's. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7013.320000000001s)]
*  It got close. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7014.52s)]
*  Yeah, I could paint a rosier picture of it [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7015.360000000001s)]
*  than is actually the case, [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7017.6s)]
*  but at least certainly much better [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7018.72s)]
*  than the place that we're at right now. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7020.360000000001s)]
*  But I hear both sides were not operating in good faith. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7022.04s)]
*  Meaning that they were. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7024.6s)]
*  Yeah, there's probably truth to that too. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7025.4400000000005s)]
*  So like, there was all types of stuff from both sides. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7026.76s)]
*  There were all types of political pressures. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7030.48s)]
*  And so like one of the very real political pressures, [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7032.08s)]
*  and I've heard this story about, [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7034.36s)]
*  so when Arafat went back after initially, [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7035.719999999999s)]
*  I don't, it may have been initially signing, [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7039.5199999999995s)]
*  or it may have been one of the subsequent meetings, [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7041.16s)]
*  but people were throwing, [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7043.4s)]
*  Palestinians were throwing their keys. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7044.719999999999s)]
*  They had their old keys from their homes in wherever, [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7048.5199999999995s)]
*  these Palestinian villages that are now part of Israel. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7052.2s)]
*  Like you sold us out, [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7055.32s)]
*  because they're hanging on to some dream [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7057.08s)]
*  that they're gonna take back over the whole thing, [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7059.839999999999s)]
*  which is like just never gonna happen. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7062.0s)]
*  And so there's political pressure on him there. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7064.5199999999995s)]
*  And then, there was also some political pressure [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7066.5199999999995s)]
*  on Yitzhak Rabin, [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7068.919999999999s)]
*  like there was that right wing Israeli who murdered him. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7069.96s)]
*  Yeah, that seems like pressure. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7072.799999999999s)]
*  There was also some of that pressure on him. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7074.36s)]
*  Wow, so both sides, [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7076.08s)]
*  there are factions of the people that are not happy. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7077.639999999999s)]
*  There are the right wingers of, [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7079.5199999999995s)]
*  respectively of either side, right? [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7081.759999999999s)]
*  And they control the discourse. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7083.839999999999s)]
*  Because even Hamas are like, [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7084.679999999999s)]
*  Hamas are the right wingers within Gaza. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7085.5199999999995s)]
*  They're the hardcore ones. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7088.84s)]
*  So anyway, so the Yitzhak Rabin, loosely speaking, [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7091.0s)]
*  and this is somewhat, [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7095.64s)]
*  rose colored glasses looking back at it, [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7097.160000000001s)]
*  but it was kind of traditionally what the view was, [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7099.400000000001s)]
*  was that, look, you have to make peace with the Palestinians, [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7103.080000000001s)]
*  otherwise you're never gonna make peace [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7107.4400000000005s)]
*  with the broader Arab world. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7109.160000000001s)]
*  That was the traditional thinking, okay? [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7111.360000000001s)]
*  And because the beef with the rest of the Arab world [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7113.96s)]
*  was over the Palestinian. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7116.76s)]
*  Was over the Palestinians, right? [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7117.68s)]
*  And all of them essentially refused to recognize Israel [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7119.52s)]
*  because they didn't recognize Israel having, [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7122.68s)]
*  well, either they didn't recognize them at all, [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7125.04s)]
*  or they didn't recognize them [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7127.400000000001s)]
*  having control of Gaza and the West Bank. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7128.240000000001s)]
*  And essentially, what the Netanyahu doctrine was, [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7130.64s)]
*  was he was like, no, no, no, I can flip this thing. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7134.88s)]
*  And the Abraham Accords were really like a culmination [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7137.8s)]
*  of the Netanyahu doctrine. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7140.6s)]
*  He goes, no, what I'm gonna do, [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7141.76s)]
*  is I'm gonna go work out deals [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7143.52s)]
*  with the surrounding Arab countries [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7145.72s)]
*  so that I never have to work out a deal with the Palestinians. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7148.6s)]
*  And then Jared Kushner, Donald Trump's son-in-law, [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7152.56s)]
*  had the brilliant idea that, hey, [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7156.84s)]
*  we got a whole lot of money, [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7159.56s)]
*  we could just bribe the shit out of all these countries [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7161.12s)]
*  and give them new fighter jets for you [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7163.56s)]
*  and a little money package for you. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7165.68s)]
*  And it kind of worked until October 7th, [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7167.68s)]
*  where you go like, oh, all right, yeah, [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7172.92s)]
*  it worked in the sense that you let the Palestinians know [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7175.2s)]
*  that your case, [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7178.44s)]
*  because the only hope for the Palestinians ever [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7179.88s)]
*  has been like, maybe the rest of the Arab countries [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7181.679999999999s)]
*  are coming at some point. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7183.76s)]
*  Again. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7184.84s)]
*  And then when you see them make all these deals, [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7185.679999999999s)]
*  it's like, nope, you will be subjugated forever, [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7187.679999999999s)]
*  you now live in hopelessness. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7191.92s)]
*  More death group. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7193.44s)]
*  And that culminated in October 7th. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7194.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh shit, you've created a desperation. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7197.72s)]
*  There would be even more supportive. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7201.32s)]
*  No one's looking out for it. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7203.16s)]
*  Terror group. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7204.04s)]
*  Oh wow, I didn't even think about that. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7205.12s)]
*  So Kushner's getting all this credit, [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7206.8s)]
*  like he's actually pushed these countries closer. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7208.2s)]
*  Oh, I hated it. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7209.72s)]
*  Do you remember arguing with him? [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7210.56s)]
*  When in reality he's created that type of, oh. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7211.4s)]
*  We need him, I was really fighting for us. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7214.96s)]
*  I was getting in a big argument with Tim Poole about this, [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7216.8s)]
*  like a couple years ago, I love Tim Poole, [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7220.32s)]
*  but we got in a big argument about this, [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7223.4s)]
*  where he was like, I don't know, Dave, [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7225.72s)]
*  you're all about peace, you gotta like Donald Trump. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7226.96s)]
*  I mean, the Abraham Accords, all these peace deals. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7228.96s)]
*  I'm like, which one of those countries were at war? [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7231.28s)]
*  None of them were at war with each other. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7234.4s)]
*  The UAE and Israel weren't fighting a war, [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7236.2s)]
*  and then he went over and worked out a peace deal. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7238.44s)]
*  He bribed both of them with my money. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7240.16s)]
*  Have you seen an F-35? [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7242.44s)]
*  Stall made it. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7245.32s)]
*  We're giving them fifth gen fighters. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7247.44s)]
*  This is the best counter argument I've heard. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7249.16s)]
*  They are pretty bad. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7251.4s)]
*  That is really interesting, I never looked at it like that. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7252.84s)]
*  I think that, again, I'm such a casual [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7254.92s)]
*  when it comes to these things, [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7258.8s)]
*  but I figured that Jared Kushner's efforts out there [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7259.64s)]
*  were universally accepted as his finest achievement. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7263.12s)]
*  He was kind of looked at as this, [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7266.6s)]
*  he was kind of positioned almost by Trump [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7270.08s)]
*  like this bumbling idiot's son-in-law, [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7271.56s)]
*  and then when people look back and reflected [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7273.88s)]
*  on what happened with the Abraham Accords, [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7275.76s)]
*  they were like, well, no, this is fantastic, [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7278.12s)]
*  what just happened, but it does create a sentiment, [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7279.76s)]
*  you can imagine within the Palestinian people, [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7282.76s)]
*  that there is no hope, and no hope can lead you [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7284.4800000000005s)]
*  to support a terrorist organization. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7287.160000000001s)]
*  Well, look, if you're just a casual though, [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7290.36s)]
*  it seems so like that on the surface. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7292.92s)]
*  Because you go, I don't know, [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7295.36s)]
*  the Arabs and Jews have always been fighting, [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7296.2s)]
*  and then here we went over and did a big deal [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7297.759999999999s)]
*  with the Arabs and Jews. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7299.32s)]
*  Now it looks like they're kicking it, [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7300.16s)]
*  they're partying. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7301.0s)]
*  Yeah, it seems totally good. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7301.839999999999s)]
*  We did shows in the Middle East. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7302.66s)]
*  But what were they fighting over? [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7303.5s)]
*  And was that situation ever actually resolved? [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7304.759999999999s)]
*  Oh no, this was just papered over by all of this. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7307.599999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna tell you how we solved this, okay? [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7310.08s)]
*  First of all, Dave's people, the Ashkenazis, [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7312.639999999999s)]
*  have caused all this problem. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7314.719999999999s)]
*  It is, it is. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7317.0s)]
*  The Jews are separating. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7317.84s)]
*  If we make more agreements with all of the Arab countries, [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7319.36s)]
*  remember, Israel is 55% Sephardic, they're Arabs, [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7323.24s)]
*  we love it. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7326.92s)]
*  Moroccans haven't met Israeli Moroccans yet. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7328.2s)]
*  Once they go over, people will be like, love these guys. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7331.08s)]
*  Then we bring them all together, push the Ashkenazis out. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7334.32s)]
*  We need your brains. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7339.639999999999s)]
*  Damn. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7342.12s)]
*  They can work remote, they can do remote. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7343.84s)]
*  This plan is the most Ashkenazi thing I've ever heard. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7346.12s)]
*  I'm pretty impressed. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7349.92s)]
*  They're rubbing off on us. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7350.76s)]
*  All right, guys, we gotta take a break real quick [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7352.4400000000005s)]
*  so I can tell you about Cook Unity. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7354.4400000000005s)]

*  But I do have a question. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7430.98s)]
*  Every time we do talk about the past and going back, [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7432.18s)]
*  say first, all the people that don't know this story, [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7435.660000000001s)]
*  we're 40, we've heard this over, we know the layers, [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7439.3s)]
*  now you're talking. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7441.9800000000005s)]
*  I know nothing, Andy. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7442.820000000001s)]
*  But a lot of people like Gen Z are hearing this [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7443.780000000001s)]
*  and then coupling that with from the river to the sea, [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7446.5s)]
*  and then all the people are like, [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7450.06s)]
*  wait a second, is that a war cry? [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7451.58s)]
*  So they don't believe we should have this [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7453.62s)]
*  and now we're defending our current, [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7454.9400000000005s)]
*  not mine, I'm not Israeli, [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7457.34s)]
*  what would an Israeli, how do they act with that? [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7459.16s)]
*  Wait, do I have to prove that I just fight now, I guess, [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7462.92s)]
*  because that's a war cry that you're saying, [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7466.679999999999s)]
*  you want me gone, what are they supposed to do? [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7469.16s)]
*  Well, I mean, the tragedy is really the last nine months. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7471.799999999999s)]
*  Nobody wants to ever hear this ever [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7480.44s)]
*  because you just kind of sound like a pussy or whatever, [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7482.32s)]
*  so it's like that you get dismissed immediately. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7486.4s)]
*  But look, after 9-11, people forget how much we had [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7488.5599999999995s)]
*  the world on our side for this brief little moment. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7493.599999999999s)]
*  They had candlelight vigils in Tehran about 9-11. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7496.759999999999s)]
*  I know there are Shiites and Al Qaeda Sunnis, [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7502.679999999999s)]
*  so there's a little something there, [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7505.799999999999s)]
*  but also part of it was just like, [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7507.36s)]
*  eh, people see that and they're like, [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7509.08s)]
*  oh dude, this is horrible. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7510.839999999999s)]
*  And if, if you could imagine, [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7513.12s)]
*  if George W. Bush had done what they did, [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7516.639999999999s)]
*  say, for the special ops missions in Afghanistan [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7521.32s)]
*  and take out the Al Qaeda bases, [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7525.639999999999s)]
*  and if they had trapped Osama Bin Laden and Tora Bora [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7528.12s)]
*  when they could have, and they allowed him to slip out [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7530.5199999999995s)]
*  so they could pursue this terror war [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7533.92s)]
*  and get their war in Iraq that they wanted, [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7535.5599999999995s)]
*  yeah, it's real interesting little detail there. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7537.36s)]
*  But like, let's say we had done it, and that was it. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7540.12s)]
*  We just, okay, these guys hit us, [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7544.92s)]
*  we're taking out their bases, and then we went, [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7546.4s)]
*  hey listen, okay, we, once you come here and kill our people, [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7548.44s)]
*  that's over the line and we have to go kill you. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7553.2s)]
*  But there are grievances that were brought up here [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7555.28s)]
*  that are somewhat legitimate, and we have been unfair [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7557.24s)]
*  in our treatment to the Muslim world, you know? [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7559.4s)]
*  And so what we're gonna do is we're gonna, [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7561.2s)]
*  you know what I mean, like step back on that. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7563.08s)]
*  And we're gonna, like, we had this powerful opportunity, [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7565.2s)]
*  to like all the things that the worst right wing hawks [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7568.92s)]
*  complain about the Muslim world, [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7571.8s)]
*  there certainly are a lot of problems there. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7573.4800000000005s)]
*  And then we could have shown that we really were [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7575.36s)]
*  the good guys, and kind of like won over a lot [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7577.32s)]
*  of support there, and really moved them [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7579.64s)]
*  in the right direction, and likewise, [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7581.8s)]
*  if after October 7th, listen, for the entire history [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7584.24s)]
*  of Israel, up until Netanyahu, they always handled [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7587.72s)]
*  the terrorism problem with targeted assassinations [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7590.72s)]
*  and special operations. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7593.76s)]
*  They never treated it like a military problem. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7595.04s)]
*  You can't just, like, the most, or one of the most [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7598.04s)]
*  densely populated areas in the world, [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7601.32s)]
*  we're just gonna level the place. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7603.4s)]
*  I mean, this was the worst way to handle it. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7605.12s)]
*  If they had just like been like, listen, if they had said, [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7607.12s)]
*  the people who were responsible for October 7th [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7609.96s)]
*  are going to be brought to justice, [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7612.96s)]
*  that is number one, non-negotiable. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7614.6s)]
*  However, we do recognize that the status quo [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7617.24s)]
*  is unsustainable, and we want to move, [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7619.56s)]
*  we are starting a new peace negotiations [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7622.28s)]
*  in a good faith position. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7624.44s)]
*  Any group of Palestinians who's here on the other side [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7626.04s)]
*  to negotiate, we're ready to sit down at the table. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7628.44s)]
*  They did have an opportunity to not turn world opinion [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7631.24s)]
*  against them, you know what I mean? [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7635.92s)]
*  And so, of course, now, after the last nine months, [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7637.32s)]
*  now it's tougher than ever to get back [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7640.2s)]
*  to a position like that, but it at least has to start [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7642.32s)]
*  with stopping this. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7645.32s)]
*  Hypothetical scenario, this is something I'm concerned about, [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7647.4s)]
*  but I think that was beautiful, and I agree with you, [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7650.16s)]
*  but I do have a concern. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7651.96s)]
*  Let's say you go back to the borders, [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7653.96s)]
*  you say, hey, we are going to stop, [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7657.56s)]
*  you can use occupying, whatever word you want to use. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7659.96s)]
*  We are going to completely remove ourselves, [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7662.6s)]
*  you guys are on your own. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7664.24s)]
*  Imagine there's going to be some support [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7665.88s)]
*  from the Muslim world as well, [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7667.36s)]
*  maybe the United States of America, [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7668.68s)]
*  blah, blah, blah, doesn't matter. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7670.08s)]
*  But the message goes out there, and it's essentially, [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7671.32s)]
*  but if there is one attack, we are going to respond in kind. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7674.4s)]
*  Are there not nefarious actors [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7679.32s)]
*  in the Israeli government potentially [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7681.92s)]
*  that could stage, what is that called? [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7684.84s)]
*  A false flag. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7686.96s)]
*  A false flag, Americans, we've done this. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7688.16s)]
*  Why wouldn't any other country do it? [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7692.2s)]
*  So even if you have everybody operating good faith, [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7693.64s)]
*  how can you even trust an attack that would come over? [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7696.8s)]
*  It's a very good point. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7700.36s)]
*  It just feels helpless, all of it. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7702.2s)]
*  Well, that is a very good point, [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7703.4s)]
*  and I could see that it feels totally hopeless, [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7705.24s)]
*  but I would just say, again, you're right. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7708.76s)]
*  I'm not disagreeing with you, [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7712.280000000001s)]
*  but I would also say that England and Ireland [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7713.360000000001s)]
*  are right next to each other. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7717.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7719.6s)]
*  That's cool. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7720.4400000000005s)]
*  You still have to try. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7721.280000000001s)]
*  No, you gotta try. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7723.64s)]
*  There has to be a process. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7724.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I think that's right. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7725.8s)]
*  Russia and Germany, or maybe that's not the best example [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7727.400000000001s)]
*  right now, but France and Germany are right next [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7733.2s)]
*  to each other, and these countries are, [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7736.04s)]
*  there would have been a time not that long ago [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7737.68s)]
*  where it would have been like, this is just never [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7739.88s)]
*  gonna work, you're never gonna get past this [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7741.56s)]
*  and get to peace, but they did. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7743.4400000000005s)]
*  And yeah, so it's, you know, there's this guy, [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7745.4400000000005s)]
*  Gene Epstein, he's a really brilliant economist, [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7750.72s)]
*  and I remember he always said this, [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7753.04s)]
*  he called it his case for radical optimism, [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7754.4400000000005s)]
*  and he goes, if you were sitting around in 1845, [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7758.6s)]
*  and you're at the height of slavery, [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7764.56s)]
*  and you went, you know, in the next 20 years, [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7767.96s)]
*  I think slavery's gonna be abolished [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7769.84s)]
*  across the Western world, anyone would have been like, [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7771.639999999999s)]
*  you're out of your mind, like the abolitionist parties [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7774.599999999999s)]
*  got like 1% of the vote, they were regularly lynched, [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7777.84s)]
*  like it was like, there's no way we're getting rid [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7781.24s)]
*  of this institution, which has been here [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7784.08s)]
*  for all of human history. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7786.12s)]
*  But like within 20 years, it was gone. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7788.32s)]
*  So even when things seem at their most hopeless, [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7790.32s)]
*  it's like, I don't know, we also live in a world [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7792.96s)]
*  clearly we're living through some type of major [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7796.96s)]
*  revolutionary paradigm shifting moment right now. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7800.04s)]
*  I think that's pretty obvious. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7803.64s)]
*  Things are, between just how much the corrupt nature [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7805.84s)]
*  of politics is being exposed, the decentralization [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7809.360000000001s)]
*  in the flow of information, [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7813.320000000001s)]
*  the rise of artificial intelligence, [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7814.96s)]
*  I'm not even claiming to understand what the implications [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7816.76s)]
*  of all of this are, but I don't know, [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7819.12s)]
*  maybe we could be radically optimistic [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7821.52s)]
*  that maybe something much better could come along. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7823.280000000001s)]
*  Overall gonna die. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7826.360000000001s)]
*  There's an interesting book on that, [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7827.200000000001s)]
*  Factfulness, have you heard of this book? [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7828.8s)]
*  I don't think so. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7830.84s)]
*  This dude Hans Rosling, he's like a Norwegian dude, [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7831.68s)]
*  but basically he like charts. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7833.320000000001s)]
*  God, I don't trust them. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7834.4800000000005s)]
*  He like charts over like the course of human history [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7835.320000000001s)]
*  that things have progressively gotten better. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7838.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7840.4400000000005s)]
*  That like there's more accessible drinking water, [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7841.280000000001s)]
*  more people have access to transportation, [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7842.6s)]
*  there's less child mortality. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7844.320000000001s)]
*  So even as things improve, we also get a distorted view [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7845.84s)]
*  of like how bad things are because the starkness [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7848.8s)]
*  between the goodness and the badness [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7851.320000000001s)]
*  starts to actually come out. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7852.72s)]
*  I know you said you don't wanna predict, [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7854.28s)]
*  but I'm gonna ask you to do one. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7855.96s)]
*  What do you think the ripple effect is [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7858.04s)]
*  of the sentiment in America seemingly turning red? [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7859.599999999999s)]
*  When I was growing up, you were just pro-Israel, [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7863.44s)]
*  no one questioned it. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7865.8s)]
*  Then starting about 10 years ago, [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7867.12s)]
*  see people started being like, [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7869.08s)]
*  whoa, what's actually going on over there? [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7869.92s)]
*  I don't know if I'm pro-Israel, I might be pro-Palestinian. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7872.04s)]
*  And it seems like the majority of people [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7875.24s)]
*  are feeling that right now. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7876.92s)]
*  What is the ripple effect of that do you think? [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7878.04s)]
*  So really, it's a good question, man. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7880.44s)]
*  That's a really good question. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7882.679999999999s)]
*  There's no doubt that that is right. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7884.0s)]
*  And I've done a bunch of debates on this topic [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7887.320000000001s)]
*  and I debated Dennis Prager [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7891.6s)]
*  and I've debated a bunch of these other guys [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7894.4400000000005s)]
*  and it's almost like there's this weird, [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7895.96s)]
*  you see it where there's a real generational gap. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7897.72s)]
*  Where part of it is that younger people [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7900.72s)]
*  are just getting their information from different sources [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7903.200000000001s)]
*  and they're not getting it [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7906.240000000001s)]
*  from the same old corporate media. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7907.12s)]
*  So the debate would almost start with Dennis Prager [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7909.04s)]
*  just saying the stuff that you could have gotten away with, [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7912.04s)]
*  I'm sure, in the 90s. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7914.2s)]
*  But now you're saying it to me [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7915.56s)]
*  and he's just like, the conflict in the Middle East [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7917.84s)]
*  is that one side wants peace [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7920.88s)]
*  and the other side wants all the Jews dead. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7922.8s)]
*  And I'm like, but that's not true. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7924.88s)]
*  He's like, oh, all right. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7926.92s)]
*  Well, I didn't realize we were allowed [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7929.8s)]
*  to tell the other side of the story. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7931.28s)]
*  So I do think a lot of it is just that people are now [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7932.64s)]
*  coming into contact with other narratives and other stories. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7936.0s)]
*  And some of those are oversimplified on the other side too. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7940.12s)]
*  It's not that they're perfect, but I do think. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7943.44s)]
*  Sorry. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7946.44s)]
*  No, I do think there's people aren't gonna buy. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7947.28s)]
*  Look, even when it comes to our country, not just Israel, [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7949.32s)]
*  we're not like a blindly patriotic country [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7952.12s)]
*  in the way that we used to be. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7954.36s)]
*  It's interesting to see. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7955.72s)]
*  It's really interesting to see. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7957.64s)]
*  I also noticed that the same thing that happened [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7959.08s)]
*  with corporate mainstream media, [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7962.96s)]
*  I think is happening with YouTube journalism as well. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7965.32s)]
*  Where it's like, at first there was this democratization [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7968.56s)]
*  of information and you were putting truth out there [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7971.92s)]
*  and speaking truth to power. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7975.080000000001s)]
*  And then the truth gets a little boring sometimes [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7976.68s)]
*  and the views go down. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7979.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7982.0s)]
*  So then you start chasing those views again. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7982.84s)]
*  Do you chase a view? [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7985.0s)]
*  Maybe you'll tell the truth about a specific narrative [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7985.92s)]
*  that's really clicky. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7989.64s)]
*  And it's almost like watching what happened with CNN [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7991.200000000001s)]
*  and Fox News and MSNBC. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7996.0s)]
*  I'm watching it happen on YouTube as well. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=7997.76s)]
*  It's kind of heartbreaking. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8000.08s)]
*  I'm sure you must have, you hope that we're kind of like, [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8001.320000000001s)]
*  at least old enough and wise enough [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8006.24s)]
*  and we're not like, the three of us knew each other [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8009.0s)]
*  literally when we had nothing. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8014.0s)]
*  When we were literally like, [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8015.4400000000005s)]
*  if someone offered you 50 bucks, [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8017.16s)]
*  I have to go do this today because there's $50. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8018.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8021.72s)]
*  So what am I insane? [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8022.56s)]
*  What a dream. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8023.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, it was literally like at a time. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8024.24s)]
*  I was like, I'm not gonna brag about that. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8026.48s)]
*  We've been a weekday thing. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8027.32s)]
*  We'd be like in the East Village and someone would be like, [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8028.16s)]
*  if you walk to 135th Street right now, [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8030.599999999999s)]
*  I will give you $50. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8033.48s)]
*  And you're like, I guess that's, you know. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8034.32s)]
*  But okay, so you're not in that situation anymore. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8037.2s)]
*  So you try to kind of like rise above [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8039.639999999999s)]
*  some of these incentives, but you feel it. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8041.48s)]
*  You feel the incentives when you're in this world [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8043.799999999999s)]
*  where it's like, I know you guys could do podcasts [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8045.92s)]
*  about like the dumbest shit that would get huge, huge numbers. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8048.719999999999s)]
*  Actively, we actively push back against it. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8053.0s)]
*  There are things that obviously we're curious in [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8055.76s)]
*  that are fun, like bringing in the Egyptologist guys [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8057.88s)]
*  over here. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8060.56s)]
*  Sure, sure. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8061.400000000001s)]
*  Dude, we have- [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8062.240000000001s)]
*  Israel Palestine, super fun. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8063.08s)]
*  But I'm just saying like the dumb shit. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8063.92s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8066.200000000001s)]
*  There is, it's so easy to have like certain people [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8067.04s)]
*  that you're just not interested in and it's just not fun. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8069.320000000001s)]
*  And you have to take the, [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8071.88s)]
*  I don't even look at it as a hit on views. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8075.240000000001s)]
*  You have to like maintain the integrity of your show. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8076.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8078.52s)]
*  I think you gotta do it for your audience, [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8079.360000000001s)]
*  but you also gotta do it for you. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8080.18s)]
*  You see people lose themselves. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8081.02s)]
*  Their identity just becomes views. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8082.400000000001s)]
*  It doesn't become the whole reason why we started talking [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8084.72s)]
*  in the first place. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8087.400000000001s)]
*  Oh my God, when you said like every like Twitter account [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8088.240000000001s)]

*  and I won't even say who this is, [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8120.04s)]
*  but it was just like one of like the dumbest [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8121.08s)]
*  like political commentator guys who's got a huge, you know, [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8123.48s)]

*  He made a video of like a segment of me on Rogan. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8129.2s)]
*  So like a video, like a segment, [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8134.799999999999s)]
*  like trying to take apart my arguments. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8136.36s)]
*  And it was all really, really stupid. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8138.839999999999s)]
*  And so then I did like a segment on my show, [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8140.8s)]
*  like responding to it and just dunking on him. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8143.400000000001s)]

*  and just take their thing apart and just get like, [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8157.280000000001s)]
*  and there's like all of the incentives are to like do that. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8160.4400000000005s)]
*  But then you're like, but I don't wanna be that guy. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8163.84s)]
*  Do you remember Red Eye? [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8165.52s)]
*  Of course, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8167.16s)]
*  It was a really fun show for comics on Fox News. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8168.0s)]
*  It was super late and it was really fun. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8170.84s)]
*  It was genuinely fun. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8174.76s)]
*  I would assume you did it. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8175.68s)]
*  Oh yeah, I did a whole lot of stuff too. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8176.72s)]
*  You started chilling it on that. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8177.56s)]
*  That was probably where people started recognizing. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8179.0s)]
*  No, they were the first TV show to book me. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8180.84s)]
*  And anyway, I remember going on and like, [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8182.84s)]
*  I was so naive to all this. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8186.68s)]
*  I liked his trusted news. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8188.2s)]
*  I mean, I was such like an innocent little fucking kid [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8189.64s)]
*  outside of like saying horrific jokes. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8192.4s)]
*  I was like, the news is real, you know? [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8194.24s)]
*  And I remember going a few times [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8196.44s)]
*  and they were bringing us some story [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8198.08s)]
*  of like something happened on a college campus. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8199.119999999999s)]
*  And I remember I even said this out loud. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8200.88s)]
*  I was like, wait, so is this just what we do? [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8202.52s)]
*  We like find like the most extreme like left-wing thing [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8204.68s)]
*  and then we just like act like [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8207.24s)]
*  that's normally happening everywhere. [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8208.359999999999s)]
*  And the rest of them looked at me like, [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8210.24s)]
*  is this guy a fucking idiot? [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8212.24s)]
*  Like I did that. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8213.44s)]
*  That's our entire business model. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8214.279999999999s)]
*  That is the whole thing. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8216.32s)]
*  I genuinely did get it. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8218.64s)]
*  Sir, you are sitting in a room [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8220.24s)]
*  in a building worth $300 million [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8222.359999999999s)]
*  and it's all paid for on that model [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8224.92s)]
*  that you just called out in front of everybody. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8228.32s)]
*  Oh God, dude. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8230.72s)]
*  You gotta find that clip. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8232.16s)]
*  I bet you it's up there somewhere. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8234.08s)]
*  And I'm just like, I was like, oh God, it got it. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8235.76s)]
*  That is the hack. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8238.2s)]
*  That is the model. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8240.24s)]
*  That's when it stops being news. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8241.28s)]
*  It stops being journalism. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8242.56s)]
*  Oh, I mean, but like Fox News was always, [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8243.76s)]
*  in a weird way, it almost became the thing [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8246.32s)]
*  you almost respect more because it's so transparent [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8249.2s)]
*  and obvious, but Fox News was always like, [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8252.36s)]
*  just like Sean Hannity comes over and he's like, [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8255.039999999999s)]
*  the Democrats wanna institute communism [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8256.88s)]
*  and take away football. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8259.4s)]
*  What? [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8260.92s)]
*  And you're like, you know there's some grandpa out there [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8261.76s)]
*  who's like, they what now? [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8263.92s)]
*  What are you doing? [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8265.24s)]
*  Like they're just the dumbest liberal, [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8266.08s)]
*  and so anyway, just to the point though, [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8268.48s)]
*  it's that like you just gotta, [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8271.279999999999s)]
*  the only real answer is you kinda just gotta [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8272.48s)]
*  guard against that. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8274.199999999999s)]
*  And even though these incentives exist, [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8275.279999999999s)]
*  you always kinda gotta try to be like. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8276.84s)]
*  Guard against for yourself. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8277.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, like let me not just do the thing [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8278.84s)]
*  that I don't wanna become, [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8281.199999999999s)]
*  because you do watch a lot of, [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8282.32s)]
*  I mean there's a lot of accounts out there [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8283.64s)]
*  that are just like. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8285.36s)]
*  I'm gonna give you, [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8287.0s)]
*  I don't know if you'll take it as a compliment, [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8288.199999999999s)]
*  I mean it's a very, very high compliment. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8289.32s)]
*  I know you guys differ politically, [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8291.76s)]
*  but Jon Stewart to me, [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8293.24s)]
*  and I differ with him on a lot of politics stuff, [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8294.4s)]
*  but I think he's fucking incredible [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8296.199999999999s)]
*  in that he is the smartest person [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8298.4s)]
*  in pretty much any room he walks into, [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8299.8s)]
*  and he does his best to be nuanced within his thoughts. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8301.48s)]
*  And I feel like a huge problem since he left [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8304.76s)]
*  is there are a lot of not even reasonable, [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8306.96s)]
*  terrible facsimiles of him [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8309.8s)]
*  that just lean one way to try to give you. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8311.84s)]
*  I feel like you are, again, a different version, [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8313.72s)]
*  because you have different thoughts, [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8317.24s)]
*  but you are the guy to take that matter. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8318.32s)]
*  Oh, well thank you. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8322.32s)]
*  Because you'll do the intellectual heavy lifting. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8323.16s)]
*  I think that's what Jon did. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8325.0s)]
*  And I think a lot of people that aren't willing to do that, [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8326.679999999998s)]
*  you have to just take a party line because it's easier. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8329.519999999999s)]
*  It is so much easier. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8334.679999999998s)]
*  And you gotta talk every day. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8336.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8337.359999999999s)]
*  Every single day. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8338.199999999999s)]
*  And it's like, I don't wanna read every single book. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8339.019999999999s)]
*  You'll fucking read the books. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8340.36s)]
*  I will read books, yeah. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8342.24s)]
*  But I do, look, I think Jon Stewart's, [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8344.36s)]
*  well, they're not boring. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8346.6s)]
*  No, I know you're doing it. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8347.76s)]
*  I can't read them if they're boring. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8348.6s)]
*  Okay, fair enough, but I guess what I'm saying is, [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8349.68s)]
*  they're boring to me. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8351.0s)]
*  You're gonna look at an argument someone made [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8351.84s)]
*  and a reference from a book that they brought up, [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8356.44s)]
*  and I imagine you might buy that fucking book. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8359.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I've done it several times, even when I hate. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8362.24s)]
*  Yeah, I've done that. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8365.44s)]
*  There was one thing where I had to buy this book [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8367.08s)]
*  from the Brookings Institute, which I really hate. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8370.76s)]
*  I hated to send them money, but someone was claiming [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8374.6s)]
*  there's this book that totally refutes my point. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8377.039999999999s)]
*  And then it wasn't until 250 pages into the book [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8379.64s)]
*  that they addressed the thing I was saying, [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8383.72s)]
*  and then they didn't refute it at all. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8386.12s)]
*  They just asserted. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8387.76s)]
*  They were like, that's not true. [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8388.6s)]
*  And I was like, did I just do all of this [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8389.8s)]
*  for absolutely nothing? [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8391.56s)]
*  And mostly, yeah, that's my torture. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8393.32s)]
*  But most people won't do that, [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8396.64s)]
*  and they wanna outsource that. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8398.439999999999s)]
*  And I think that there are times like this where, [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8399.8s)]
*  especially with this specific situation, [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8403.519999999999s)]
*  where people are terrified to kinda share an opinion [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8405.64s)]
*  because they don't know what that opinion will do [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8407.8s)]
*  on either side, and they look, they gravitate [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8409.56s)]
*  towards people who are gonna do [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8412.72s)]
*  that intellectual heavy lifting to figure things out [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8413.68s)]
*  and slice things thin enough [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8417.039999999999s)]
*  where you can comfortably speak about an issue. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8418.24s)]
*  Well, there's, and look, man, there's, [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8420.32s)]
*  because there's levels to all of this stuff, [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8422.359999999999s)]
*  and so when it comes to being the most informed [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8424.36s)]
*  or an expert on stuff, I'm not that, [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8426.84s)]
*  because there's people with levels of expertise above me. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8428.960000000001s)]
*  But I do think, kinda to your point, [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8431.800000000001s)]
*  Jon Stewart, particularly with his original version [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8435.400000000001s)]
*  of The Daily Show, there was just, again, [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8437.84s)]
*  I feel like the bar's kind of low. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8441.08s)]
*  I also feel like that's why I look impressive, [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8442.76s)]
*  because the bar's just so low. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8444.480000000001s)]
*  But there was a thoughtfulness there. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8446.0s)]
*  There was something in Jon Stewart [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8447.92s)]
*  where he kinda had a view that was, [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8449.32s)]
*  okay, he's put some thought into this, [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8452.12s)]
*  and he actually had, and then it was like everyone [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8453.64s)]
*  after him, every version of that show after him. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8456.199999999999s)]
*  They just want to be famous. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8459.359999999999s)]
*  Let me say the talking point [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8460.68s)]
*  that the audience already wants to hear, [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8462.039999999999s)]
*  and this also just happened with Late Night and, [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8463.96s)]
*  by the way, it's not even a comment [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8466.76s)]
*  on these people's talent, because Stephen Colbert [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8468.8s)]
*  was like enormously talented on the Colbert report. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8472.599999999999s)]
*  And Kimmel was like hilarious back in the day, [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8476.76s)]
*  is just that it's almost like the economy became. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8479.800000000001s)]
*  Just say the thing, don't take any chances, [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8483.72s)]
*  just say what you already know is gonna get you, [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8487.880000000001s)]
*  it's like, listen, there's a $200 million check [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8490.64s)]
*  in this for you if you just get out there, [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8492.880000000001s)]
*  and how about your joke is, [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8494.9s)]
*  the unvaccinated should die, ain't that right? [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8496.36s)]
*  Okay, and it's, I do think for anybody, [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8498.76s)]
*  even if you are just like a Democrat, [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8503.72s)]
*  even if you kinda agree with them, [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8506.04s)]
*  this is no way to live. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8508.359999999999s)]
*  Your artists aren't supposed to be genetic replicas [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8510.32s)]
*  of the last thing that everyone all day said today. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8513.199999999999s)]
*  This is terrible. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8516.16s)]
*  God, I hate that stuff. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8517.56s)]
*  And also for us, when the three of us first came up, [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8519.32s)]
*  were coming up in standup, [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8523.96s)]
*  it was almost before the rise of all that, [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8525.84s)]
*  and that was the cool thing. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8528.759999999998s)]
*  It was like, no, everybody was unique and different, [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8530.039999999999s)]
*  and everybody was saying things that were wild and offensive [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8532.84s)]
*  or this, but like. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8538.48s)]
*  Yeah, because it wasn't mainstream yet. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8539.32s)]
*  But there was this beauty in the art form, [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8540.14s)]
*  it's like really what I fell in love [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8542.0s)]
*  with standup comedy over, [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8543.519999999999s)]
*  was that you could go kind of like, [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8545.119999999999s)]
*  if you somehow could combine this like really wild thought, [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8547.4s)]
*  but then also hitting on something true [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8551.279999999999s)]
*  that everyone kind of knew and felt, [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8553.16s)]
*  you could bring the whole room together in this moment, [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8555.08s)]
*  this involuntary moment, [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8557.539999999999s)]
*  where they all went, ah, this guy got us. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8559.56s)]
*  There's something so beautiful about that. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8562.72s)]
*  And then even in standup, I mean, [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8564.56s)]
*  you know, I remember like over, [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8566.68s)]
*  really it was like after Trump got in, [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8569.16s)]
*  it was like in 2016, 2017, 2018, [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8571.720000000001s)]
*  the rise of like the woke mindset in standup comedy [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8575.08s)]
*  was so bizarre to me. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8579.2s)]
*  Oh, see, I felt it was happening before that, [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8580.76s)]
*  and I think Trump was, maybe when it hit its zenith, [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8582.48s)]
*  but when Trump won, I was like, [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8585.08s)]
*  one, I think silver lining to whatever, [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8586.68s)]
*  however dark you think this cloud is, [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8588.84s)]
*  people are realizing that woke shit is, [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8591.08s)]
*  it's a rat for it, the clock has started, [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8592.9s)]
*  it's gonna run out. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8595.1s)]
*  Maybe that's right. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8595.94s)]
*  But it was wild there, it was like at a fevered pit [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8597.02s)]
*  for a while. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8600.5s)]
*  It was really funny. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8601.34s)]
*  It makes so much sense, like standup is so hard, [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8602.18s)]
*  and so imagine if I just need to get a quick laugh, [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8605.1s)]
*  yo, Trump sucks. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8608.26s)]
*  Just saying it, saying it, everybody. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8609.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8610.18s)]
*  It's like, give it up to God. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8611.02s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8612.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8613.18s)]
*  Where you can get an applause break for nothing. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8614.02s)]
*  Also, they're so terrified, the audience is in there, [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8616.94s)]
*  and they don't wanna be ostracized by their friends, [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8619.380000000001s)]
*  or their coworkers, their communities, [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8621.26s)]
*  they're like, I'm just gonna laugh [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8622.7s)]
*  at the things that I'm allowed to laugh with. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8623.74s)]
*  And then there's also the true believers within the crowd, [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8626.279999999999s)]
*  where it was like we had empowered the person [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8629.48s)]
*  who kinda wanted to be offended to like, [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8632.72s)]
*  oh no, you're right. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8634.88s)]
*  You're right to interrupt this whole show right now. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8636.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you tell them. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8638.92s)]
*  How dare that person with his male privilege on stage, [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8640.24s)]
*  or whatever, say this about you. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8644.0s)]
*  I remember early in that time, right, [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8645.519999999999s)]
*  when things were getting a little bit sensitive, [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8647.56s)]
*  naturally, I'm gravitating towards a thing [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8651.32s)]
*  that's a little bit more wrong, distasteful, [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8654.56s)]
*  defending a position that you really shouldn't defend, [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8657.64s)]
*  and trying to find some logical thread [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8659.84s)]
*  to make it all make sense. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8661.6s)]
*  But it was so sensitive, I remember there was like, [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8663.119999999999s)]
*  there were comics at the cellar [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8666.039999999999s)]
*  who thought I was like, big MAGA. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8668.14s)]
*  And I was like, no, I'm just doing the thing [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8671.88s)]
*  that we all supposed to do. We've been doing it. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8674.08s)]
*  Yeah, remember like four years ago, [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8676.24s)]
*  when we were just making crazy jokes? [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8678.56s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just doing that now. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8680.6s)]
*  It's just crazy to defend that guy. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8681.68s)]
*  But they truly believed it. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8684.72s)]
*  That's how sensitive, when even the comics [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8686.039999999999s)]
*  were propagandized. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8689.4s)]
*  That's what I'm trying to say. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8690.28s)]
*  Audiences, I'm fine, think whatever you want. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8691.119999999999s)]
*  Well, it's also a certain type of comedian, [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8693.36s)]
*  and I know you were always this way, [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8695.44s)]
*  I was always this way, you were always this way, Akash. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8697.96s)]
*  Not every comic is like this, [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8700.52s)]
*  but would have that thing of being like, [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8703.0s)]
*  well, right away, if everybody is against Y, [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8705.08s)]
*  well, like man, if I could be Thor Y, [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8711.619999999999s)]
*  and make the whole room laugh, [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8714.2s)]
*  if I could do that again, still win it all over. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8715.44s)]
*  And that would be like the ultimate achievement [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8717.880000000001s)]
*  in comedy right now. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8720.12s)]
*  And it's the most fun. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8721.44s)]
*  It's naughty. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8723.2s)]
*  Yeah, and they remember. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8724.04s)]
*  If you get them on that, it's the most fun. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8724.880000000001s)]
*  And so it was a weird time where like even you're like, [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8727.52s)]
*  yeah, this is what we've always been doing, man. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8730.0s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, like it was like, [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8732.16s)]
*  no, that's illegal now. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8733.92s)]
*  We came here to agree tonight. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8735.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8737.12s)]
*  That's the one, I think negative effect of Jon Stewart [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8737.960000000001s)]
*  because he said things he believed and he made them funny [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8741.36s)]
*  and he was intelligent. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8743.76s)]
*  But then a lot of comics, I think, were like, [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8745.0s)]
*  oh, that is comedy. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8747.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was so. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8748.96s)]
*  That is comedy, saying the things I believe. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8749.8s)]
*  Yeah, he was so influential in the way that he did comedy [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8751.039999999999s)]
*  that maybe people thought, okay, I gotta be right. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8754.88s)]
*  Well, it's kind of like, you know how like, [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8757.52s)]
*  Doug Stanhope is like one of the greatest comedians [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8760.199999999999s)]
*  to ever live. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8762.52s)]
*  Yes. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8763.36s)]
*  But every comedian inspired by Doug Stanhope sucks balls. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8764.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8767.0s)]
*  Like they're just the worst. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8767.84s)]
*  It really is a testament to how great he is. [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8768.68s)]
*  He's so great. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8769.96s)]
*  You can't do that. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8771.56s)]
*  He can. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8772.759999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8773.599999999999s)]
*  But there is like this weird thing where like, [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8774.439999999999s)]
*  it's like, no, that guy's really good at it. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8776.519999999999s)]
*  You don't have the thing he has, [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8778.599999999999s)]
*  which is a one in a billion thing. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8780.16s)]
*  And now you're just trying to be like, [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8782.48s)]
*  let me get up there and say something. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8784.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8785.92s)]
*  Don't do that. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8786.759999999998s)]
*  It's great because the honesty [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8787.599999999999s)]
*  and the people try to be honest the way that he's honest. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8788.439999999999s)]
*  They don't have the chops. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8791.039999999999s)]
*  It has to be honest the way you're honest. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8792.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8794.24s)]
*  They don't have the chops, they don't have the affect, [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8795.08s)]
*  they don't have the ideas. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8796.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8798.039999999999s)]
*  He's a truly brilliant guy that is so like pure [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8799.039999999999s)]
*  in the way he does it. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8802.24s)]
*  He makes you think that that's how you are [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8803.08s)]
*  with your friends. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8804.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8805.8s)]
*  And you are not. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8806.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8807.48s)]
*  You know what? [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8808.32s)]
*  He might not be. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8809.16s)]
*  He has worked on that craft for fucking 40 years [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8810.439999999999s)]
*  and that's why it seems so now. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8813.119999999999s)]
*  And you're also, you're looking at him like, you know, [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8814.439999999999s)]
*  whatever, 20 years into his career [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8816.72s)]
*  or whatever it was at the time [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8818.599999999999s)]
*  when he was inspiring people. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8819.8s)]
*  It's like, that probably wasn't him three years in either. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8820.88s)]
*  You know, like he was probably just figuring out [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8823.24s)]
*  how to tell a joke and stuff. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8824.8s)]
*  But you're trying to jump right to that. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8826.32s)]
*  So yeah. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8828.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8829.44s)]
*  Okay, anything else going on in the world? [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8830.28s)]
*  I know we have limited time. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8832.2s)]
*  Are you voting in November? [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8833.04s)]
*  Do you vote? [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8834.6s)]
*  That's a great question, I'm gonna ask. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8835.44s)]
*  We didn't even talk Trump-Harris. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8837.04s)]
*  Okay. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8838.24s)]
*  You don't have to say who, but I'm just curious. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8839.08s)]
*  Do you? [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8840.16s)]
*  No, I mean, I would tell you if I was going to. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8841.0s)]
*  I mean, like, I don't know. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8842.92s)]
*  I just, probably not. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8843.960000000001s)]
*  I don't really believe in voting for president. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8846.320000000002s)]
*  I'm not a big, well, I mean, I just, [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8848.720000000001s)]
*  I think if you're, let's just say it takes you [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8852.320000000002s)]
*  an hour or two of your day to go vote. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8856.92s)]
*  If you're taking an hour or two of your day [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8860.48s)]
*  to do anything that you have a one in 140 millionth [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8863.439999999999s)]
*  of a say in, if it was anything, [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8869.88s)]
*  I would look at you and be like, [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8873.439999999999s)]
*  isn't there something better you could do with your time? [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8875.039999999999s)]
*  Like, that's crazy. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8877.359999999999s)]
*  Like, that's just, literally, we would not do that [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8878.359999999999s)]
*  in anything else in our lives. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8880.439999999999s)]
*  It's kind of, I think, this ritual of the religion of [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8883.28s)]
*  the government. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8889.560000000001s)]
*  It feels like a social responsibility. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8890.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I would say. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8891.24s)]
*  I also just don't like, if I were to vote, [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8892.28s)]
*  it would be some type of protest vote. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8895.320000000002s)]
*  Like, I wouldn't, you know what I mean? [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8897.320000000002s)]
*  And it doesn't matter. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8899.0s)]
*  I mean, I live in New Jersey. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8901.04s)]
*  It's gonna be a, it's gonna go for Harris. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8902.24s)]
*  There's no real, like, so. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8904.6s)]
*  I also just, you know, I really feel like [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8906.800000000001s)]
*  the Democrats deserve to lose this election [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8909.24s)]
*  for several reasons. [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8913.68s)]
*  I think, I mean, look, the biggest things that I say [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8914.52s)]
*  of the Biden-Harris administration were like, [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8919.880000000001s)]
*  the first big project was we're gonna get this vaccine [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8922.52s)]
*  in as many people as possible, [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8925.320000000002s)]
*  no matter what we have to do to get it in them, [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8927.12s)]
*  force, whatever we have to do. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8929.84s)]
*  And the whole thing was sold off of lies. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8931.960000000001s)]
*  The thing didn't work the way they said it would work, [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8933.800000000001s)]
*  and most people didn't need it. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8935.720000000001s)]
*  Then it was, we're all in on funding the war in Ukraine, [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8937.68s)]
*  which I think is like the most reckless policy [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8940.800000000001s)]
*  in modern American history. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8943.439999999999s)]
*  And then they just totally weaponized the justice system [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8945.16s)]
*  against their political opponent. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8948.64s)]
*  And like, if that doesn't mean you deserve to lose, [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8950.359999999999s)]
*  then I don't know what would. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8953.519999999999s)]
*  And then I see Trump. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8957.439999999999s)]
*  And I'm just like, I don't, you know. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8959.64s)]
*  So he's on the other side, like, [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8965.439999999999s)]
*  I'm literally coming off of him. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8966.48s)]
*  I'm like, these Democrats have to lose [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8967.56s)]
*  in order for this country to survive. [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8969.759999999998s)]
*  And then Trump's up there and he's like, [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8971.480000000001s)]
*  full immunity for cops. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8972.76s)]
*  You know, you're like, what? [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8974.52s)]
*  What type of plan is that? [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8976.36s)]
*  He didn't even say qualified immunity, [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8978.2s)]
*  because I don't even think he knows the difference [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8979.880000000001s)]
*  between the two. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8981.52s)]
*  But it just goes full immunity? [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8982.36s)]
*  They can just do whatever they want. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8984.24s)]
*  But it just, and I just hate the campaign he's running. [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8986.36s)]
*  Okay, take it, help us understand the last few weeks. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8990.76s)]
*  Biden steps down. [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8994.84s)]
*  Well. Kind of. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8997.32s)]
*  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8998.16s)]
*  do we have a little? [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=8999.28s)]
*  Well, I mean, that was a straight up coup. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9000.48s)]
*  They just totally stole this, you know. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9003.4s)]
*  And you. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9005.4s)]
*  And we're being a little hyperbolic here, I imagine. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9006.4s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9008.24s)]
*  I don't know how hyperbolic we're being. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9009.6s)]
*  Straight up coup. [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9011.4s)]
*  It's like a metaphor. [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9012.24s)]
*  No, I mean, well, look, let's just look at it. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9013.08s)]
*  Like the facts, as we have it, okay? [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9016.32s)]
*  I love that he's about to win this. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9018.16s)]
*  Well, again, tell me where I'm wrong. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9019.199999999999s)]
*  I read a little something on this. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9021.359999999999s)]
*  So Joe Biden has been obviously [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9022.199999999999s)]
*  in severe cognitive decline for many years now. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9025.32s)]
*  The entire media is like in emperor's new clothes mode. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9028.24s)]
*  You're not allowed. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9033.56s)]
*  The week before the debate, [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9034.4s)]
*  the new propaganda term that was rolled out was cheap fakes. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9036.039999999999s)]
*  I don't know if you guys remember, [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9039.64s)]
*  it was the shortest-lived propaganda campaign ever. [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9040.48s)]
*  It only lasted a few days. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9042.28s)]
*  Cheap fakes? [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9043.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, cheap, you know, it sounds like deep fakes. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9043.96s)]
*  But you see, there's all these cheap fake videos online. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9046.84s)]
*  Now, cheap fakes are different than deep fakes [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9049.72s)]
*  in that they're real. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9052.76s)]
*  But they're out of context. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9055.08s)]
*  So people are putting out these videos [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9058.6s)]
*  that make it seem like Joe Biden's [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9060.48s)]
*  in severe cognitive decline. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9063.28s)]
*  But this is all right-wing disinformation. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9065.16s)]
*  So this is what every corporate news outlet was saying [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9069.0s)]
*  the week leading up to the debate. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9071.28s)]
*  Then the debate happens. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9073.0s)]
*  It goes so catastrophically bad [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9074.36s)]
*  that they have to do this crazy 180-degree turn. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9076.72s)]
*  At least he told the truth. [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9080.28s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9081.44s)]
*  It's like they're struggling with how do we grapple [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9082.28s)]
*  with what, which was like, I mean, [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9084.76s)]
*  the debate performance itself was like, [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9086.800000000001s)]
*  it's like, yeah, how did you guys let it get to this point? [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9088.64s)]
*  You pretended that it wasn't a problem until literally, [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9091.16s)]
*  it's not even just like a grandpa out of a nursing home. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9094.52s)]
*  It was like the guy who's really not doing good [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9099.16s)]
*  within that nursing home. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9101.04s)]
*  Like your average nursing home, you know, [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9102.2s)]
*  take patient, is doing better than this guy. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9106.04s)]
*  There will never be a worse debate ever. [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9108.4s)]
*  By far. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9110.64s)]
*  In the history of televised presidential debates, [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9111.48s)]
*  it was by far the worst appearance. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9113.0s)]
*  Nothing even comes close. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9114.36s)]
*  Right after the debate, the entire media has to turn on him [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9116.96s)]
*  and they're like, someone else has to come get him. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9119.4s)]
*  He said he's gonna go, he goes to Camp David [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9121.88s)]
*  and he has a meeting with all his inner circle. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9126.52s)]
*  It's like Jill Biden and Hunter Biden [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9129.359999999999s)]
*  and his closest advisors and they all go there. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9131.52s)]
*  Hunter's advisor is probably the best. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9133.96s)]
*  Yeah, the hunter's, you got me. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9135.48s)]
*  You can do it. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9137.48s)]
*  This thing's gonna turn around, bro. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9138.32s)]
*  So tomorrow we're gonna be up by 20 points. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9140.6s)]
*  I got a 10 point plan. [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9142.359999999999s)]
*  Follow these 10 points. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9143.359999999999s)]
*  But anyways, so they go there. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9145.32s)]
*  So he decides, it comes out, he goes, no, I'm running. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9146.16s)]
*  You know, I beat this guy in 2020. [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9149.8s)]
*  I'll beat him again this year. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9151.88s)]
*  That's my legacy. [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9153.72s)]
*  I'm gonna beat Donald Trump twice, I'm running. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9154.56s)]
*  It's just not working. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9158.48s)]
*  They send him out on a series of interviews [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9159.72s)]
*  and things like that. [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9162.16s)]
*  He blows every single one of them, every last one. [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9163.08s)]
*  And he really, it was just terrible [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9165.36s)]
*  because now it was like the story [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9166.88s)]
*  of the emperor's new clothes or whatever. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9169.8s)]
*  This was after, now someone's already yelled out, [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9171.32s)]
*  he's naked. He's naked. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9174.039999999999s)]
*  And so now there's a microscope on it. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9175.68s)]
*  So every little, these things that were happening for years, [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9177.44s)]
*  but when he came out there and he was like, [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9180.800000000001s)]
*  hey, my vice president Donald Trump [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9182.44s)]
*  has been all over the country. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9184.28s)]
*  And you're like, your vice president is Donald Trump? [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9185.640000000001s)]
*  Or when he introduces Putin. [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9187.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9188.720000000001s)]
*  He called Zelensky Putin. [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9189.560000000001s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9191.12s)]
*  So it was really bad. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9192.12s)]
*  But he's still like, no, I'm not leaving. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9193.76s)]
*  I'm not leaving. [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9195.44s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have a meeting with him [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9196.28s)]
*  where they're strong arming him. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9199.04s)]
*  They're like, we're withholding $90 million [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9200.6s)]
*  from your campaign because you have to step down [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9203.4s)]
*  and step aside. [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9206.16s)]
*  He's like, no, I'm not leaving. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9207.08s)]
*  Then according to Cy Hirsch, [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9210.16s)]
*  who's a real legit reporter on this, [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9211.88s)]
*  and I think he's right about this, [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9213.88s)]
*  Barack Obama comes in, goes, listen, [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9216.96s)]
*  we got Kamala Harris on board. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9220.72s)]
*  I got the entire donor class [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9222.8s)]
*  and I got the congressional leaders on board. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9224.72s)]
*  You are out. [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9226.8s)]
*  We are invoking the 25th Amendment [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9228.72s)]
*  and removing you from office [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9231.279999999999s)]
*  if you don't voluntarily drop out of the race. [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9234.08s)]
*  And Joe Biden says no. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9236.4s)]
*  Wow. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9239.0s)]
*  The day that that letter came out was a Sunday. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9239.84s)]
*  That Sunday, on the Sunday news shows, [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9245.08s)]
*  you can go watch Face the Nation and Meet the Press [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9248.08s)]
*  from the Sunday Joe Biden's, the letter comes out. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9250.24s)]
*  Biden's surrogates are on the news going, [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9254.64s)]
*  why are we still talking about this? [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9257.72s)]
*  He's made his decision. [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9259.72s)]
*  He won the primary. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9261.560000000001s)]
*  This is the democratic process. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9263.24s)]
*  It's his choice if he wants to run for it [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9264.84s)]
*  and he's running. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9266.720000000001s)]
*  It's Trump versus Biden. [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9267.800000000001s)]
*  Get used to it. [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9269.48s)]
*  Those are your two options. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9270.48s)]
*  Who do you want to be president? [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9271.92s)]
*  Mere hours later, the sitting president [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9274.12s)]
*  of the United States of America, [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9278.4s)]
*  a few weeks out from convention, [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9281.12s)]
*  announces that he's not, [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9283.640000000001s)]
*  after telling you, yes, I'm doing it, [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9285.2s)]
*  I'm doing it, I'm doing it, [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9286.52s)]
*  announces he's not. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9287.44s)]
*  And he doesn't do this with an address to the nation. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9288.68s)]
*  He does it with a letter on personal stationary [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9291.759999999998s)]
*  with a signature that does not seem to match [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9296.519999999999s)]
*  other Joe Biden signatures. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9299.8s)]
*  That's it, like, whatever. [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9301.199999999999s)]
*  Forget even the signature. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9302.24s)]
*  But like, it's like, that is such a weird way to do it. [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9303.08s)]
*  Yeah, I thought that was peculiar. [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9307.039999999999s)]
*  And then it's on Twitter, but like, that is so bizarre. [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9307.88s)]
*  And then we don't hear from Joe Biden [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9311.24s)]
*  for another three or four days. [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9313.84s)]
*  And so all I'm saying is if you look at all the information, [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9315.92s)]
*  it seems like what happened is that [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9318.88s)]
*  their next move was to just put that out. [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9321.839999999998s)]
*  And literally before Joe Biden is seen from again, [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9324.08s)]
*  the funds are already being transferred [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9327.4s)]
*  over to Kamala Harris. [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9329.279999999999s)]
*  I think it was presented to him as a fait accompli, [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9330.92s)]
*  as the French say, that it's like, this is done. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9334.039999999999s)]
*  You've already been removed. [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9336.519999999999s)]
*  What are you gonna do now? [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9337.839999999998s)]
*  You're gonna go back out there? [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9339.48s)]
*  And look, they could just say, [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9340.839999999998s)]
*  if he went back out there and went, [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9342.759999999998s)]
*  I never wrote that letter, [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9344.039999999999s)]
*  they'll be like, well, we'll say you did. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9344.96s)]
*  And you forgot. [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9347.0s)]
*  Who's gonna really believe you anymore at this point? [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9349.12s)]
*  And so it's like, and I'm sure, my guess is, [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9351.28s)]
*  they had all types of other, [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9354.560000000001s)]
*  I mean, his son has legit legal problems. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9356.32s)]
*  So they're holding other things. [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9359.12s)]
*  I'm sure there's all types of other things [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9359.960000000001s)]
*  that they had on him, Lord. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9361.84s)]
*  It's like, hey, how do you wanna play this here? [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9362.68s)]
*  Do you want son to go to prison for the rest of his life [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9364.68s)]
*  and your legacy is totally destroyed? [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9367.2s)]
*  Or do you wanna be, and as soon as he stepped down, [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9369.92s)]
*  the corporate media went right back to, [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9373.24s)]
*  the greatest president ever, [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9375.0s)]
*  a selfless decision that he made [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9376.960000000001s)]
*  for the good of his country, he would step down. [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9379.16s)]
*  And then, and now we're into this new propaganda campaign, [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9381.6s)]
*  which is that Kamala Harris is a cultural phenomenon. [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9385.52s)]
*  We're all supposed to believe that. [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9388.4s)]
*  That sounds like a straight up coup, [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9389.24s)]
*  now that you put it that way. [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9390.68s)]
*  Yeah, you might be right about the coup. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9391.52s)]
*  So help me understand the Harris phenomenon, right? [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9393.2s)]
*  Because I think she's universally accepted [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9395.44s)]
*  to be a kind of like a bumbling idiot [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9398.04s)]
*  about three weeks ago. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9400.28s)]
*  And then that immediately transitions [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9401.8s)]
*  to this undying love. [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9404.76s)]
*  And even if it was a corporate propaganda push, [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9407.519999999999s)]
*  it has transferred to the public effectively. [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9415.119999999999s)]
*  Meaning they're convinced, [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9419.24s)]
*  like if you ask audiences in the city, [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9420.8s)]
*  if they're excited about Kamala, they will cheer. [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9422.8s)]
*  And if you ask them why, they will not say a word. [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9425.279999999999s)]
*  Dude, you know what's crazy? [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9429.439999999999s)]
*  So how does that happen? [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9431.599999999999s)]
*  You know what's crazy? [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9432.439999999999s)]
*  As of a week ago, I think, [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9433.28s)]
*  I think a week and a half ago, [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9434.68s)]
*  you go to kamalaharris.com, her website, [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9435.800000000001s)]
*  there are no policies on her website. [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9437.880000000001s)]
*  I don't know about now, but it was just donate by merch. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9440.720000000001s)]
*  Comics have more information on their website [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9445.16s)]
*  than Kamala Harris. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9448.16s)]
*  That's probably pretty smart. [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9450.36s)]
*  Well, yeah, take the time to figure out [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9452.400000000001s)]
*  what all your policy is gonna be, [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9453.800000000001s)]
*  because she didn't know she was gonna be running [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9454.960000000001s)]
*  a month ago. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9457.400000000001s)]
*  You expect her to have a whole presidential plan [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9459.960000000001s)]
*  for the country? [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9462.04s)]
*  Like overnight? [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9463.4s)]
*  Not overnight. [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9464.24s)]
*  You're the vice president. [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9465.08s)]
*  She is the vice president. [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9465.92s)]
*  If you throw any of those things up, [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9466.74s)]
*  then now it's shot down. [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9467.759999999998s)]
*  Part of your job description, Al, [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9468.599999999999s)]
*  if the president gets assassinated, you're in charge. [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9469.8s)]
*  So you don't have any, you don't have no plan. [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9472.599999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden croaks, he's 90 years old. [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9474.8s)]
*  And when the president's Joe Biden, [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9477.24s)]
*  don't tell me this hadn't crossed the line. [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9478.759999999998s)]
*  Yeah, but then if she would've put that up beforehand, [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9481.0s)]
*  it'd be like, oh shit, is she trying to push [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9484.039999999999s)]
*  him the fuck out of here? [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9486.56s)]
*  I'm talking about weeks later. [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9487.4s)]
*  I think the answer is just that policy [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9488.519999999999s)]
*  isn't their strength, [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9490.08s)]
*  and so why even get into that? [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9491.2s)]
*  Those crowds that you're talking about, [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9493.52s)]
*  I mean, look, the truth is that the Democrats [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9494.96s)]
*  haven't since Obama had anyone who's like [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9499.119999999999s)]
*  an animating figure. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9502.4s)]
*  What's motivating those people is that [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9504.56s)]
*  they hate Donald Trump. [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9506.4s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9507.24s)]
*  And there's a tremendous sense of relief [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9508.08s)]
*  because they had this crazy liability [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9510.32s)]
*  of a senile guy, and now that's gone. [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9512.88s)]
*  They're embarrassed. [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9515.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9516.28s)]
*  I think they actually were quiet. [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9517.119999999999s)]
*  All these people that are Harris supporters [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9518.52s)]
*  were anti-Trumpers that felt embarrassed [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9521.52s)]
*  supporting Biden. [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9524.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9525.04s)]
*  Because support for Biden, I think, was, [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9525.880000000001s)]
*  I mean, it was a huge liability for the country. [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9528.880000000001s)]
*  Like, you would put the country in a potentially [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9531.24s)]
*  dangerous situation by vocalizing your support [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9533.880000000001s)]
*  for this guy who's definitely senile. [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9536.08s)]
*  And also just the pretending that you don't see it. [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9537.44s)]
*  Exactly, exactly. [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9540.84s)]
*  So you feel fraudulent, right? [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9541.68s)]
*  Yes. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9543.44s)]
*  And the second there was another option, [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9544.28s)]
*  they fucking jump on it. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9545.36s)]
*  Right. [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9546.52s)]
*  Which makes sense, but to see that now [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9547.36s)]
*  turn into enthusiasm is... [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9549.88s)]
*  I think the enthusiasm's more like, [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9552.64s)]
*  oh shit, we might have a chance to win. [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9554.359999999999s)]
*  I think that's interesting. [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9556.599999999999s)]
*  I think that's part of it. [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9557.439999999999s)]
*  That's interesting. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9558.599999999999s)]
*  Also, look, there's a reason why Kamala Harris was picked [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9559.439999999999s)]
*  to be vice president, and the, you know, [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9564.199999999999s)]
*  it's like the progressive DNA gets really into historic [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9568.439999999999s)]
*  firsts, you know? [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9574.519999999999s)]
*  There's something about that. [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9576.0s)]
*  Look, this is why Joe Biden picked her, [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9577.32s)]
*  because if it's Joe Biden, it's just, hey, [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9578.64s)]
*  okay, we're gonna redact Donald Trump, [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9580.68s)]
*  and in favor of the establishment. [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9582.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9584.88s)]
*  The guy who's been in politics for 50 years. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9585.72s)]
*  It's like, eh. [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9588.16s)]
*  But if you could attach to that the first vice president [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9589.199999999999s)]
*  who's a woman of color, then okay, all right, [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9592.439999999999s)]
*  we got a little something that we're working with here. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9594.56s)]
*  And so now they're rolling this out. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9596.48s)]
*  I think she's benefiting from the contrast between, [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9598.599999999999s)]
*  like, you know, I mean, the bar was like, [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9602.0s)]
*  she can walk and read words off a teleprompter. [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9604.199999999999s)]
*  That's where the bar was at. [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9607.279999999999s)]
*  She can do both of those things. [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9609.72s)]
*  She knows, she just got off of this plane, [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9611.56s)]
*  and so she's not gonna try to walk back up the stairs [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9614.24s)]
*  off of this plane. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9616.4s)]
*  Don't walk up the stairs. [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9617.24s)]
*  Because she knows she can get off of it. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9618.08s)]
*  She can tackle stairs. [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9619.519999999999s)]
*  Same numbers. [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9621.359999999999s)]
*  She's really excellent at walking up stairs. [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9622.199999999999s)]
*  She's black. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9624.839999999998s)]
*  Like, it's, anyway, so they've kinda, [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9625.679999999998s)]
*  so there's a little bit of that, but then there's also, [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9629.4s)]
*  you know, I do think that liberals much more so [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9632.0s)]
*  than Trump supporters, they do kinda respond still [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9635.640000000001s)]
*  to the corporate media signals. [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9638.76s)]
*  And so if you just start telling them all day long [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9640.640000000001s)]
*  this is exciting, you're excited about this, [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9642.720000000001s)]
*  they start to, I also think there's been a tremendous, [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9644.84s)]
*  so I have, this is totally anecdotal, [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9647.44s)]
*  I don't know what this means, [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9650.16s)]
*  but I've gotten like 30 text messages at this point [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9651.24s)]
*  about donating to Kamala Harris, about different, [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9654.52s)]
*  and I've like, I don't donate to, [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9657.12s)]
*  one time I've donated to Tulsi Gabbard when she was running, [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9659.76s)]
*  it's the only Democrat I've ever donated to. [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9662.12s)]
*  It's just like, and so there's a lot of astroturfing [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9664.44s)]
*  of like making, and all that money [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9667.64s)]
*  that they were withholding from Joe Biden, [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9669.32s)]
*  they pumped right into Kamala Harris's campaign, [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9671.52s)]
*  and so there's this attempt to build her up. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9673.8s)]
*  I would, I think a lot of it's an illusion. [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9676.2s)]
*  There's gonna be, there's still gonna be several more [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9679.44s)]
*  hurdles for her that, she has to debate Donald Trump [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9682.32s)]
*  at least one time. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9685.88s)]
*  She's gonna have to sit down for tough interviews. [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9687.4s)]
*  Kamala Harris has this thing where she's, [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9689.56s)]
*  she can read a teleprompter speech with no problem. [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9693.28s)]
*  You give her a teleprompter speech, she'll read it. [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9696.32s)]
*  When she's asked tough questions, [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9698.28s)]
*  she seems like she just took like a 600 milligram edible [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9700.6s)]
*  like just kicked in, and she starts going into this like, [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9705.76s)]
*  space is above us and around us. [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9708.84s)]
*  Which is like, I don't understand it exactly. [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9712.32s)]
*  Maybe she's very nervous or something, [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9714.44s)]
*  I don't get why she goes into that, [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9715.8s)]
*  but well, I don't know. [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9717.84s)]
*  I mean, I don't really trust that elections [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9720.96s)]
*  are free and fair ever. [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9722.68s)]
*  I've never, way before Donald Trump ever started saying that, [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9724.52s)]
*  I never trusted elections, so I don't know, [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9727.24s)]
*  but it does seem like, okay, they're going with her. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9730.0s)]
*  There was a reason why everyone was assuming [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9733.36s)]
*  it wouldn't be her even if Biden dropped out. [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9735.32s)]
*  Because nobody believed. [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9737.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9739.68s)]
*  Okay, so now there's support. [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9740.52s)]
*  Now explain Trump. [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9741.800000000001s)]
*  Trump is at all time high, he gets shot. [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9743.92s)]
*  I mean, immediately the day after, [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9748.24s)]
*  I'm like, just hand him the election. [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9749.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9751.720000000001s)]
*  There's no way that they could make up this kind of ground. [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9753.439999999999s)]
*  He's a hero, he did it in this prolific fashion, [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9755.359999999999s)]
*  he's got his fists in the air, fight, fight, fight. [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9758.32s)]
*  It's almost like that happened 30 years ago. [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9761.279999999999s)]
*  Nobody is even talking about this anymore. [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9764.439999999999s)]
*  Like, his campaign seems to like lack energy. [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9767.64s)]
*  Like, what the fuck is happening in Trump land? [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9770.72s)]
*  Something really changed in Donald Trump [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9774.8s)]
*  since he took that bullet. [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9776.76s)]
*  And I don't know if you guys notice it, [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9777.8s)]
*  but to me, it's very clear. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9779.119999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's like, first off, at his convention speech, [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9780.76s)]
*  he was like, totally affected by it. [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9784.960000000001s)]
*  You know, understandable. [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9787.0s)]
*  But look, there's an obvious blueprint here [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9788.92s)]
*  for Donald Trump that Donald Trump would always follow. [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9793.4s)]
*  And he's not following it right now. [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9797.64s)]
*  What is that blueprint? [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9799.44s)]
*  Well, look, I mean, what did he say about Russiagate? [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9800.28s)]
*  It was a witch hunt. [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9805.08s)]
*  They were out to get me, right? [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9806.24s)]
*  What did he say about all the criminal charges against him? [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9807.52s)]
*  Witch hunt. [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9809.72s)]
*  They were weaponizing the Justice Department against me. [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9811.4s)]
*  And if he wanted to keep this story in the media [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9812.96s)]
*  and make this the story of the whole thing, [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9815.48s)]
*  he could just say what, I mean, look. [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9817.4s)]
*  Everybody thinks the CIA tried to kill me. [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9820.279999999999s)]
*  They allowed, listen, after framing me for treason [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9822.0s)]
*  and then weaponizing the justice system against me, [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9826.08s)]
*  oh, the Secret Service just happened to allow [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9828.359999999999s)]
*  someone with a sniper rifle to get within 130 yards of me [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9830.84s)]
*  and get a clear shot at my head, [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9834.96s)]
*  this guy who's, you can see on video, [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9837.0s)]
*  is scoping out the area for an hour plus beforehand [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9839.6s)]
*  while people on the ground are screaming, [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9843.4s)]
*  he's got a rifle on that roof. [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9845.08s)]
*  And they didn't yank the president off the stage. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9847.84s)]
*  He could, Donald Trump always stokes conspiracy beliefs. [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9850.88s)]
*  He always does this. [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9854.68s)]
*  He could easily just be poking this thing [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9856.16s)]
*  and make this the biggest story and totally make this, [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9859.039999999999s)]
*  like this is what Trump always had the ability to do. [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9861.84s)]
*  He decides what's gonna be in the news cycle today. [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9864.119999999999s)]
*  It's a superpower, you know? [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9866.4s)]
*  And he is very clearly not doing that. [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9868.160000000002s)]
*  Dude, Elon Musk asked him the other day [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9870.480000000001s)]
*  on their spaces about it. [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9872.560000000001s)]
*  Then he just started praising the Secret Service [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9874.800000000001s)]
*  for what a great job they did. [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9877.0s)]
*  That was the first thing he did. [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9877.84s)]
*  He said the Secret Service is amazing, [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9878.960000000001s)]
*  what an amazing job. [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9880.44s)]
*  So my conclusion, Trump shook. [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9881.640000000001s)]
*  Basically, Trump's going, wow, they tried to take me out [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9885.84s)]
*  and by they, that means the CIA or the alphabet agencies, [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9888.08s)]
*  the powers that be, and now he's like, holy shit, [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9891.320000000002s)]
*  it is that easy to take me out? [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9894.240000000002s)]
*  I barely survived this one. [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9895.92s)]
*  They will try it again. [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9898.0s)]
*  I better toe the company line. [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9899.68s)]
*  I better behave. [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9901.16s)]
*  Listen, I think that seems to be the only explanation [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9902.8s)]
*  that makes sense to me. Holy shit. [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9905.72s)]
*  And I think Donald Trump, Donald Trump, [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9906.84s)]
*  look, when he ran in 2016, he said, [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9910.16s)]
*  it was like, I'm gonna drain the swamp. [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9912.76s)]
*  And that was like his, but the thing is, [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9915.04s)]
*  when you're talking about draining the swamp, [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9917.64s)]
*  you're talking about rolling back the biggest honeypot [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9920.04s)]
*  in the history of the world. [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9923.72s)]
*  You're draining the swamp? [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9926.48s)]
*  That's gonna piss a lot of people off, baby. [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9928.12s)]
*  If you wanna actually, Tucker Carlson said this, [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9930.24s)]
*  but I think he's dead right about it. [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9932.6s)]
*  If you really want it to drain the swamp, [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9935.56s)]
*  you have to be ready to die. [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9937.800000000001s)]
*  You have to be ready to sacrifice your life [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9940.16s)]
*  for that mission. I actually fear for Vivek if he wins. [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9942.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, exactly. [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9943.84s)]
*  And I don't think Donald Trump was ever ready to die [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9946.08s)]
*  for this. [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9951.800000000001s)]
*  I think Donald Trump was, the way his mind works is, [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9952.640000000001s)]
*  he's on tremendous. [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9956.28s)]
*  I'm very smart. [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9957.68s)]
*  These other people are very stupid. [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9958.880000000001s)]
*  I see the obvious solution to this. [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9960.84s)]
*  You know, like he would always just be like, [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9962.800000000001s)]
*  you know, it was kind of just like, [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9964.2s)]
*  yeah, we shouldn't fight stupid wars. [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9965.28s)]
*  It's bad business, you know? [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9966.960000000001s)]
*  So let's not do that anymore. [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9968.08s)]
*  I don't think he had any clue [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9969.640000000001s)]
*  what he was actually up against. [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9970.560000000001s)]
*  And I think that probably, yeah, [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9972.36s)]
*  bullet whizzing by your head and being like, [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9975.08s)]
*  yo, their plan was actually to blow your brains out [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9977.560000000001s)]
*  on national television. [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9982.0s)]
*  That might make you think, [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9983.84s)]
*  ooh, I don't know if I want to piss them off. [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9985.92s)]
*  Also, the Secret Service are still responsible [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9988.36s)]
*  for his security going forward. [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9990.28s)]
*  And so my takeaway is just like looking at it, [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9992.880000000001s)]
*  having observed Trump over all these years, [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9996.92s)]
*  I'm like, oh, for the first time, he seems really shook. [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=9999.16s)]
*  Like he seems like, yeah, he's worried about this. [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10002.880000000001s)]
*  I don't think he wants to die. [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10005.84s)]
*  I would say even before that, [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10006.68s)]
*  because first time he was running, [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10008.24s)]
*  he was running on I'm gonna drain the swap. [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10010.84s)]
*  He gets elected, there was no drainage of any swap. [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10012.720000000001s)]
*  Like I think immediately once he got elected, [[02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10016.16s)]
*  he got talking to in a way where it's like, [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10019.08s)]
*  oh, he knows what he can and cannot do. [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10020.800000000001s)]
*  He even bailed out Hillary. [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10023.28s)]
*  Did you hear him talk about Hillary? [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10024.84s)]
*  He's like, we could have done horrible things to her, [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10026.64s)]
*  but I think we should move on and. [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10028.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah, no, like this is my point. [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10030.36s)]
*  She's just going. [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10031.68s)]
*  You didn't hear this? [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10032.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10033.36s)]
*  They were like, you know, there were all these, [[02:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10034.2s)]
*  you know, campaign promises of lock her up, [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10036.64s)]
*  but you didn't end up locking her up. [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10038.56s)]
*  And basically his response was basically just like, [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10039.84s)]
*  we said things on the campaign, [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10042.24s)]
*  but how about we're all just nice to each other? [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10043.4s)]
*  No one's gonna lock anyone up. [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10044.839999999998s)]
*  It doesn't look good to do that. [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10045.679999999998s)]
*  Yeah, come on. [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10047.4s)]
*  You lock up a president's wife, a secretary, [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10048.24s)]
*  say that doesn't look good for a man. [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10050.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, wow, look at the energy shift in that. [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10052.24s)]
*  So is he running now, despite all of this, [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10055.4s)]
*  just to free his like criminal record? [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10058.199999999999s)]
*  He can freeze criminal record by stepping down. [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10061.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think. [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10063.039999999999s)]
*  I think that's a negotiation. [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10063.88s)]
*  So then why is he putting himself through this [[02:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10065.08s)]
*  for a third time? [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10066.519999999999s)]
*  Now they need a Patsy. [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10067.359999999999s)]
*  Well, I think. [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10068.199999999999s)]
*  In deep probably. [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10069.039999999999s)]
*  I think Donald Trump is motivated by what, [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10069.86s)]
*  Donald Trump is obviously motivated by. [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10073.26s)]
*  Power. [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10075.02s)]
*  I mean, the guy who's like, well, it's not just power. [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10075.86s)]
*  It's like. [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10076.980000000001s)]
*  Potential. [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10077.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, you know, identity. [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10078.66s)]
*  Like, you know, he's the guy who has to build [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10081.300000000001s)]
*  a huge skyscraper and put his name and gold letters on it. [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10083.34s)]
*  Like, and the fact that he was a one term president, [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10087.18s)]
*  I think really bothers him. [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10090.900000000001s)]
*  The fact that he, it's the narrative is he lost. [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10092.54s)]
*  You know, he has to constantly correct that [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10095.42s)]
*  anytime anyone thinks of it. [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10097.300000000001s)]
*  And I think he wants to come back and win again. [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10098.58s)]
*  But I don't know what exactly he wants [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10100.7s)]
*  after this assassination attempt. [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10102.82s)]
*  And I don't know, you know, [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10104.46s)]
*  I think he wants to win still, [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10108.3s)]
*  but he also kind of wants to signal that it's like, [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10110.18s)]
*  hey, come on, man. [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10112.7s)]
*  Like, all right, drain the swamp. [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10113.78s)]
*  Well, all right, we're talking about drain the swamp. [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10116.42s)]
*  Let's just like, you know, make the swamp [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10118.42s)]
*  a little better than the swamp. [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10120.1s)]
*  Here's a question I wanted to ask you. [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10121.38s)]
*  Robbie Slovic, who you probably know. [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10124.02s)]
*  Oh yeah, I love Robbie. [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10125.46s)]
*  Another very smart political comic. [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10126.3s)]
*  I really trust him. [[02:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10127.54s)]
*  Throughout the election cycle, I've been asking him, [[02:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10128.86s)]
*  what do you think Trump's chances are? [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10130.580000000002s)]
*  He's like, Trump has no chance. [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10131.660000000002s)]
*  He even said after the bullet was by his ear, [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10133.18s)]
*  he goes, people are gonna forget this. [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10135.54s)]
*  Trump has no chance. [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10137.26s)]
*  The only time he was worried was the debate. [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10138.18s)]
*  He's like, Biden's in such bad decline, I don't know. [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10140.18s)]
*  But people aren't gonna vote for Trump who are in the middle. [[02:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10142.820000000002s)]
*  They're just not anymore. [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10146.02s)]
*  But Donald Trump has hijacked the Republican party. [[02:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10147.7s)]
*  So let's say he loses this election, gets bold again, [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10150.52s)]
*  is like, you know what, fuck it, [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10153.820000000002s)]
*  I wanna run again in 2028. [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10155.220000000001s)]
*  What are Republicans gonna do? [[02:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10158.42s)]
*  Like, how do they get their party back? [[02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10160.18s)]
*  I mean, I think he's just too old at that point. [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10161.7s)]
*  I mean, Donald Trump is gonna be 84? [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10164.14s)]
*  No. [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10167.26s)]
*  What does he say? [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10168.4s)]
*  Oh wait, you're saying next election? [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10169.24s)]
*  I'm saying, you're saying if he was running 28. [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10170.08s)]
*  That's too much. [[02:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10172.86s)]
*  I don't think it's possible [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10173.7s)]
*  that he's gonna run again there. [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10175.54s)]
*  I don't agree with Robbie on that. [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10177.06s)]
*  I mean, I think like, I think that certainly [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10178.74s)]
*  if it was Trump versus Joe Biden, I think there's, [[02:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10182.220000000001s)]
*  if there were real elections, I think no question [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10185.3s)]
*  Donald Trump was gonna win that. [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10187.66s)]
*  Look, Donald Trump was down pretty big in the polls [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10188.9s)]
*  against Hillary Clinton and ended up winning. [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10192.74s)]
*  He was down substantially more in the polls [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10195.06s)]
*  than he ended up. [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10198.9s)]
*  Like it was, he did better than he was polling in 2020. [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10199.8s)]
*  That's how Trump always is. [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10204.539999999999s)]
*  He always does a little bit better than he's polling. [[02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10205.68s)]
*  He was even up in the polls in every single swing state [[02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10207.86s)]
*  against Joe Biden. [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10210.78s)]
*  Now it's kind of returned back to where Trump [[02:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10212.24s)]
*  typically is, which is like the polls say he's gonna lose, [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10215.06s)]
*  but there's a lot of closeted Trump voters out there. [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10217.3s)]
*  I think what Robbie's probably underestimating [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10219.7s)]
*  is that like, there's real, the inflation [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10223.6s)]
*  is really killing people, dude. [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10229.14s)]
*  And the immigration is really unpopular. [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10230.62s)]
*  And I think that really, really hurts the Democrats. [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10233.26s)]
*  Now that being said, I'm more on the conspiratorial side [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10236.26s)]
*  where I'm like, all the signals that I've seen so far [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10239.98s)]
*  is that the powers that be will not allow Donald Trump [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10242.82s)]
*  to be in the White House again. [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10246.02s)]
*  So if you were saying- [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10247.38s)]
*  Not even with his capitulation? [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10248.22s)]
*  I mean, maybe, maybe, I don't know. [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10250.22s)]
*  Maybe that could be a game changer. [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10252.02s)]
*  But I will say that all the signals [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10254.539999999999s)]
*  for the last four years have been that [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10257.38s)]
*  all the most powerful people are telling you, [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10261.18s)]
*  this guy will not be allowed to be in the White House again. [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10263.3s)]
*  And those people have a lot of power. [[02:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10266.92s)]
*  Hmm. [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10269.300000000001s)]
*  You bet against the CIA, you usually don't win. [[02:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10271.58s)]
*  You think some mail-in ballots are something worse? [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10273.82s)]
*  I mean, what have we seen already? [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10278.42s)]
*  I mean, I don't know what the next step above this is. [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10280.300000000001s)]
*  But I think, I certainly think that like, it is, [[02:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10282.980000000001s)]
*  listen, whatever, man, I don't wanna say anything [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10287.42s)]
*  that could get anyone's channel in trouble. [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10289.78s)]
*  So I'll just say like, in hypothetical- [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10291.28s)]
*  Say it and we'll cut it. [[02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10292.5s)]
*  Okay, so in hypothetical country. [[02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10293.5s)]
*  Or do you want us to cut it or are you just gonna- [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10294.74s)]
*  No, no, you can, I'll try to say it in the best. [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10296.140000000001s)]
*  Let's just say, like, I was reading this novel [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10298.06s)]
*  the other day. [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10300.46s)]
*  There we go. [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10301.38s)]
*  About this crazy corrupt country [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10302.22s)]
*  that totally changed the way they did elections [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10304.38s)]
*  on the year that the guy that they didn't want to win [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10307.06s)]
*  was getting, was up for reelection. [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10309.539999999999s)]
*  It just seems a little bit suspicious, you know? [[02:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10312.3s)]
*  So like, I don't know. [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10314.58s)]
*  You guys decide, I don't know what the latest YouTube rules [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10316.019999999999s)]
*  or whatever it is, I don't know what I'm allowed to say. [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10318.699999999999s)]
*  But I certainly, I don't know anything, [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10320.82s)]
*  but I definitely have my suspicions about what they would do [[02:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10322.3s)]
*  and I don't think it would be that hard for them to do that. [[02:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10325.58s)]
*  My question was gonna be how accurate do you think Trump was [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10327.98s)]
*  in 2020 saying, rigged, stolen, blah, blah, blah? [[02:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10330.259999999998s)]
*  Okay, so I'll say it like this, right? [[02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10333.74s)]
*  So I've read a lot about like, [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10337.939999999999s)]
*  US sponsored colored revolutions, you know, [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10341.38s)]
*  which is like where they'll, they're basically like these, [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10344.66s)]
*  these CIA operations and they've done them in like Serbia, [[02:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10347.22s)]
*  Iran, and yeah, well, what they'll do is [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10350.699999999999s)]
*  basically everything they did in 2020. [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10354.58s)]
*  It's almost like down to a T, like everything. [[02:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10358.14s)]
*  From like, though they get protests in the streets, [[02:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10360.74s)]
*  which remarkably they are able to control [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10364.539999999999s)]
*  in a way that is like really wild to me, [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10366.98s)]
*  but it is amazing how like that whole BLM protest thing, [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10369.699999999999s)]
*  it's amazing how quickly the Democrats could turn that off. [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10373.14s)]
*  Soon as Joe Biden's back in there, it's like, [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10375.939999999999s)]
*  well, that's off, you're not on the streets anymore, nope. [[02:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10377.38s)]
*  And in the middle of COVID, [[02:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10379.619999999999s)]
*  when they were telling everyone to stay inside, [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10380.859999999999s)]
*  they just sent all the signals out, [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10382.5s)]
*  you're allowed to go out now, [[02:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10383.46s)]
*  if you're doing this protest thing. [[02:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10384.42s)]
*  There was big money people who were bailing out [[02:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10386.62s)]
*  the worst of the rioters, [[02:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10389.1s)]
*  like these people would be getting arrested nightly [[02:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10391.300000000001s)]
*  and they'd be raising money to like bail them out. [[02:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10393.300000000001s)]
*  I believe Kamala Harris even donated [[02:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10395.62s)]
*  to one of these organizations, double check me on that, [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10397.86s)]
*  if I'm right on that. [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10400.02s)]
*  But regardless, then there was like, you know, [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10400.86s)]
*  like the media campaigns against the guy, [[02:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10404.78s)]
*  the lockdowns being prolonged even way past [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10408.300000000001s)]
*  when it was obviously like unnecessary [[02:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10411.380000000001s)]
*  and not mitigating the virus. [[02:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10413.820000000002s)]
*  I think a lot of that was kind of to tank the economy. [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10416.06s)]
*  There was mass censorship in 2020 [[02:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10418.38s)]
*  of pro-Trump influencers, just anything, yeah, [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10421.18s)]
*  just getting kicked off. [[02:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10424.939999999999s)]
*  And then they totally overhauled the way we do voting [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10425.82s)]
*  with no real mechanism to like verify [[02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10430.14s)]
*  that these cards were coming from the right places. [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10433.859999999999s)]
*  And so I don't know, looking at all of that, [[02:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10436.939999999999s)]
*  after Trump lost, I could understand [[02:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10439.019999999999s)]
*  why any one of his supporters would be like, [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10442.1s)]
*  you know, this was not fair. [[02:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10444.42s)]
*  Especially after they had framed him for treason. [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10445.66s)]
*  And the whole Russiagate thing was completely made up, dude. [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10447.86s)]
*  It was all based off lies. [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10450.26s)]
*  The total deep state like SIOP is not true at all. [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10451.5s)]
*  It was totally laughable that Donald Trump [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10454.98s)]
*  was in a conspiracy with the Russians, just bullshit. [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10457.14s)]
*  And so now Donald Trump in Trumpian fashion [[02:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10460.22s)]
*  had no idea how to wield power or how to combat this. [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10466.9s)]
*  So he just bitched and moaned about it. [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10469.82s)]
*  And then he sent his lawyers out to like be like, [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10471.86s)]
*  we have proof. [[02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10473.94s)]
*  And then every time they went to court, [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10475.22s)]
*  they just got thrown out of court, [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10477.02s)]
*  because they had nothing. [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10478.1s)]
*  They had nothing other than what I just said. [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10479.06s)]
*  Like, it was just like beating, they were like, no fair. [[02:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10480.58s)]
*  This whole thing is no fair. [[02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10483.539999999999s)]
*  And the judge would be like, [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10484.66s)]
*  around here we need evidence. [[02:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10486.3s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10487.619999999999s)]
*  You can't just come into court and go no fair. [[02:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10488.46s)]
*  But looking at all that stuff, you're like, [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10490.82s)]
*  I mean, it's clearly like, you know. [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10493.1s)]
*  A lot of circumstantial evidence. [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10495.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10497.3s)]
*  And you could just look at it and be like, [[02:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10498.14s)]
*  look, they're clearly like kind of set in this whole thing. [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10499.539999999999s)]
*  How far did that actually go? [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10501.46s)]
*  I have no idea. [[02:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10503.14s)]
*  I'm not gonna say anything [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10504.34s)]
*  about any of those voting companies. [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10505.18s)]
*  I don't have that money to pay those lawsuits. [[02:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10506.66s)]
*  But I also don't know. [[02:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10508.9s)]
*  I'm not trying to say anything more than I know. [[02:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10510.82s)]
*  But I'm like, you could look at this and be like, [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10513.019999999999s)]
*  it does seem like it's not beyond the realm of possibility. [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10515.22s)]
*  The weird thing, [[02:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10518.46s)]
*  like with all the stuff we were talking about, [[02:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10519.3s)]
*  like the way Donald Trump, [[02:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10520.74s)]
*  which has always been one of the most fascinating things [[02:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10524.26s)]
*  about him to me is the way he triggers left-wing people, [[02:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10525.859999999999s)]
*  like the reaction that he gets out of them [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10529.58s)]
*  is so, it's so enraging that it's like blinding them [[02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10532.1s)]
*  to anything else. [[02:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10536.74s)]
*  So I've never really liked Donald Trump. [[02:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10537.58s)]
*  He's never been my style. [[02:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10539.619999999999s)]
*  I don't like that, just a million things about him [[02:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10541.619999999999s)]
*  I don't like. [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10545.42s)]
*  But I was never so enraged by him that I couldn't be like, [[02:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10546.98s)]
*  oh, this is a kind of fascinating moment right here. [[02:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10549.779999999999s)]
*  This guy's running against the system and winning. [[02:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10552.18s)]
*  And so it was almost like a lot of those left-wing people, [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10554.66s)]
*  they were just like, oh, I hate Donald Trump. [[02:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10557.74s)]
*  They were like, well, he's a Russian agent. [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10559.26s)]
*  They're like, that's right, he's a Russian agent. [[02:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10560.539999999999s)]
*  Whatever the anti-Trump narrative is, they'll jump on it. [[02:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10562.62s)]
*  And then you'll be like, hey, you know, [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10566.300000000001s)]
*  that was the CIA who told you that. [[02:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10567.380000000001s)]
*  And you know, left-wing guy, [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10569.42s)]
*  you're not supposed to like the CIA. [[02:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10572.1s)]
*  Since when do you like the CIA? [[02:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10574.18s)]
*  Like there's just no more even critical thinking. [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10575.86s)]
*  So it's like, you don't have to like Donald Trump [[02:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10578.380000000001s)]
*  to look at this and go like, [[02:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10580.62s)]
*  it does seem like there's something going on here. [[02:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10582.02s)]
*  Yeah, Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and some of these guys [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10584.980000000001s)]
*  who it's almost like they are trying, [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10589.220000000001s)]
*  like they have a startup oligarchy. [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10592.94s)]
*  Like they're just like, hey, listen. [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10597.14s)]
*  Technocrats. [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10598.62s)]
*  Well, like this oligarchy has failed us so much [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10599.460000000001s)]
*  that like we have to start our own oligarchy. [[02:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10602.380000000001s)]
*  Who are these guys, the tech guys? [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10605.1s)]
*  Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, these guys. [[02:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10606.14s)]
*  And I generally do kind of go like, [[02:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10608.5s)]
*  well, I mean, the current oligarchy is really failing. [[02:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10611.66s)]
*  So like maybe these guys would be better. [[02:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10614.7s)]
*  I mean, they're certainly not like principled libertarians [[02:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10617.26s)]
*  or something like, they're not me. [[02:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10620.98s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10622.300000000001s)]
*  Like they're not, they're willing to do, [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10623.14s)]
*  they're willing to get CIA contracts or whatever it is. [[02:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10624.82s)]
*  It's like, I think my read on it is kind of like, [[02:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10628.06s)]
*  I think these guys, first off, they're brilliant. [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10631.82s)]
*  They're very successful. [[02:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10634.98s)]
*  And I think they see the current trajectory [[02:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10636.5s)]
*  as a real long-term problem. [[02:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10639.460000000001s)]
*  And that they're kind of like, listen, [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10641.300000000001s)]
*  like this is gonna be really bad for business ultimately. [[02:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10643.02s)]
*  Like if we keep going in this direction, [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10646.220000000001s)]
*  this whole thing is gonna collapse [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10648.34s)]
*  and then we can't do what we're doing right now, [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10650.300000000001s)]
*  which is making billions of dollars. [[02:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10652.02s)]
*  That's what they cut up. [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10653.98s)]
*  Bad for their business right now, US business. [[02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10654.82s)]
*  Sure, well, I mean, maybe, I don't know, [[02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10656.300000000001s)]
*  to the extent that it overlaps maybe both, [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10658.02s)]
*  I don't really know. [[02:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10660.98s)]
*  But it does seem like there's no question that, [[02:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10662.66s)]
*  like Elon Musk, you know, I tend to kind of take him [[02:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10666.62s)]
*  at his word that he wanted Twitter to be more [[02:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10670.14s)]
*  of a free speech place to some degree. [[02:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10671.98s)]
*  I think he believes that to some degree. [[02:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10674.26s)]
*  But there does seem to be a dynamic there where it's like, [[02:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10676.5s)]
*  I do also think he wanted to kind of let the pro-Trump [[02:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10679.74s)]
*  people back on to Twitter. [[02:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10684.14s)]
*  And that that was kind of like, you know, a big part of, [[02:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10686.54s)]
*  you know, if you're gonna let the people [[02:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10688.98s)]
*  who have been kicked off, well, who is that? [[02:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10690.82s)]
*  It's mostly the pro-Trump people who have been kicked off. [[02:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10692.460000000001s)]
*  Not exclusively. [[02:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10694.7s)]
*  But I don't know, there's an interesting force there [[02:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10696.94s)]
*  where they are really behind Trump now, [[02:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10699.98s)]
*  especially with JD Vance, who's Peter Thiel's guy. [[02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10702.3s)]
*  Why did Elon back off of the $35 million a month [[02:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10704.9s)]
*  that he said he was gonna give Trump? [[02:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10708.539999999999s)]
*  Oh, I had heard someone say something about that, [[02:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10711.099999999999s)]
*  but I don't know, I don't know that. [[02:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10714.179999999998s)]
*  I think he tweeted it. [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10715.019999999999s)]
*  He said, I'm gonna go. [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10715.859999999999s)]
*  And then he just backed off of that. [[02:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10717.259999999998s)]
*  I didn't hear that he backed off. [[02:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10719.259999999998s)]
*  Yeah, he backed off. [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10720.74s)]
*  Wow. [[02:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10721.58s)]
*  Pretty quickly. [[02:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10722.42s)]
*  Well, someone probably crunched his numbers. [[02:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10723.259999999998s)]
*  They were like, you know, you spent a lot of money [[02:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10725.099999999999s)]
*  on this platform, really? [[02:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10726.5s)]
*  Another 35 a month? [[02:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10727.859999999999s)]
*  So I was a big Elon Musk fan. [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10729.099999999999s)]
*  Now I find it all a little bit disingenuous [[02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10731.54s)]
*  to buying Twitter for free speech. [[02:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10733.980000000001s)]
*  I don't care if you let pro-Trump people on, [[02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10736.580000000002s)]
*  but I'm a little annoyed when all your tweets [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10738.26s)]
*  are suddenly pro-Trump, and it's like, [[02:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10739.980000000001s)]
*  do you want free speech or do you want your guy to win [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10742.660000000002s)]
*  because it benefits you? [[02:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10745.460000000001s)]
*  And that's fine, just don't present yourself [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10746.94s)]
*  as some fucking guy putting on my cape [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10748.740000000002s)]
*  and I'm letting you guys speak. [[02:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10751.42s)]
*  Well, maybe the argument would be that he thinks [[02:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10753.1s)]
*  his guy can only win if there's free speech, [[02:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10757.62s)]
*  but that free speech is still the principle. [[02:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10760.9s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10764.22s)]
*  Those things aren't necessarily mutually exclusive. [[02:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10765.06s)]
*  I mean, I do think that, like, I don't know. [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10767.66s)]
*  I don't know what's in his heart or what is his brain [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10772.06s)]
*  that works differently than all of our brains do, [[02:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10775.74s)]
*  but I think what he exposed with the Twitter files [[02:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10778.42s)]
*  was pretty wild. [[02:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10782.74s)]
*  It was a service to the American people that we know that, [[02:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10784.58s)]
*  and that it is kind of like, you know, [[02:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10788.62s)]
*  it's obviously a little bit of a gray area, [[02:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10791.34s)]
*  but if the idea of the First Amendment [[02:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10794.460000000001s)]
*  was that in the public square, [[02:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10797.740000000002s)]
*  you can go make whatever argument you wanna make, [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10799.740000000002s)]
*  and if people wanna listen to you, they can. [[03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10802.380000000001s)]
*  Well, the public square is outdated. [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10804.980000000001s)]
*  The public square is social media now, [[03:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10807.18s)]
*  and so if you're saying that, [[03:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10809.820000000002s)]
*  you could be out there making arguments, [[03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10811.220000000001s)]
*  which in many cases, people were making correct arguments [[03:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10812.94s)]
*  about lockdowns and vaccines [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10816.1s)]
*  and how they were not what they were sold as, [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10818.06s)]
*  and the government could come in [[03:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10821.1s)]
*  and put pressure on these companies to silence you. [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10823.539999999999s)]
*  To me, that's the most terrifying thing, [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10826.82s)]
*  because like I was saying earlier, [[03:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10829.5s)]
*  that's the whole prospect for like, [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10830.859999999999s)]
*  oh, maybe we could actually save this whole thing [[03:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10832.26s)]
*  just because they've lost their grip on control. [[03:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10834.14s)]
*  So if you have that, then it's almost like [[03:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10836.18s)]
*  the First Amendment is meaningless at that point, [[03:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10839.42s)]
*  because if the government can control that, you're screwed. [[03:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10841.46s)]
*  So I'm sure he's a flawed person, [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10843.82s)]
*  but to the extent that he's rolled that back a little bit, [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10846.94s)]
*  I'm pretty grateful for that. [[03:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10849.9s)]
*  I'll say personally, I at least feel, [[03:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10851.34s)]
*  I felt like through 2020, 2021, 2022, [[03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10856.380000000001s)]
*  I felt like constantly, I was navigating through this fear [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10861.300000000001s)]
*  that I was gonna get shut down, [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10867.220000000001s)]
*  and I had to constantly be like, all right, man, [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10868.9s)]
*  how do I say this in the way that's best gonna navigate? [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10871.460000000001s)]
*  I mean, I can't tell you how many tweets, [[03:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10874.7s)]
*  I think I wrote back before Elon Musk took it over [[03:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10877.699999999999s)]
*  where I like wrote it and then went, [[03:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10880.06s)]
*  I need to delete it, dude, like, what am I doing? [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10881.699999999999s)]
*  Am I gonna risk everything over [[03:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10883.94s)]
*  because I wanna say this one thing? [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10885.58s)]
*  And like, even just getting people like me [[03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10887.26s)]
*  to make that calculation constantly, [[03:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10889.26s)]
*  like it's a real chilling effect, [[03:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10891.539999999999s)]
*  and I don't feel that way as much anymore. [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10893.42s)]
*  So maybe that's just my feeling about it, [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10896.06s)]
*  I don't know if that's right. [[03:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10898.619999999999s)]
*  No, I think it's probably a net positive, [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10899.46s)]
*  and I do think the free speech is important. [[03:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10900.779999999999s)]
*  I just don't necessarily trust his intentions [[03:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10902.58s)]
*  as he presented them. [[03:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10904.34s)]
*  Yeah, no, you might be right about that. [[03:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10905.42s)]
*  I mean, I think he's got people off still, [[03:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10907.74s)]
*  and there are people who still aren't left back out, [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10909.54s)]
*  which is almost like a weird thing [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10911.380000000001s)]
*  because he'll say constantly, [[03:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10913.18s)]
*  he does kind of contradict himself, [[03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10914.58s)]
*  he'll say, hey, look, as long as you haven't done [[03:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10916.380000000001s)]
*  anything illegal, then you're allowed to say it on X [[03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10919.220000000001s)]
*  because we're for free speech, [[03:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10922.060000000001s)]
*  but then Kanye tweets like a swastika flag or something, [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10923.380000000001s)]
*  and he bans him, and you're like, [[03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10927.54s)]
*  all right, well, which one is it? [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10929.1s)]
*  You know, like, I mean, I don't know, [[03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10930.66s)]
*  either you believe in this or you don't. [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10931.980000000001s)]
*  So he certainly hasn't been like 100% of what he said, [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10933.58s)]
*  and I think that's a little bit better. [[03:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10937.42s)]
*  And also, you know, the thing with Kanye, [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10939.34s)]
*  it's like he was just trying to get kicked off anyway. [[03:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10940.94s)]
*  I think that was gonna happen. [[03:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10943.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10944.86s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder if we need an adjustment period [[03:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10946.7s)]
*  for the fullest form of free speech. [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10950.38s)]
*  So I think like the knee-jerk reaction [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10955.38s)]
*  to what we're seeing on Twitter, even like this week, [[03:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10956.94s)]
*  is like, what the fuck is going on? [[03:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10959.22s)]
*  Maybe you can't let people just say whatever they want, [[03:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10960.66s)]
*  but I think that is what happens [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10962.98s)]
*  when you give someone a sports car, [[03:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10964.7s)]
*  and I think eventually it takes time, [[03:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10967.06s)]
*  but the people that are consuming this stuff [[03:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10969.58s)]
*  eventually start to weed it out. [[03:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10971.98s)]
*  We go, oh, this is just like. [[03:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10973.22s)]
*  It's a good analogy, man. [[03:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10974.9s)]
*  You're like, listen, we're gonna crash that first car, [[03:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10976.34s)]
*  all right, so we're gonna crash this first civilization. [[03:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10979.06s)]
*  That's it. [[03:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10981.9s)]
*  But if you give us a few. [[03:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10982.74s)]
*  Civilizations, we got this. [[03:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10983.58s)]
*  But like, I think, again, it's not like you give us [[03:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10984.9s)]
*  free speech and we're like, I'm gonna behave [[03:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10988.14s)]
*  with all this freedom that you're giving me. [[03:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10989.779999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna go do some wild shit. [[03:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10992.14s)]
*  It's spring break, you know, we're in Mexico, [[03:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10993.42s)]
*  something's gonna happen, and then after maybe, [[03:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10995.5s)]
*  I don't know, five years, 10 years, [[03:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=10998.78s)]
*  a few different election cycles, [[03:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11000.62s)]
*  when you start to realize the same pattern's happening, [[03:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11001.74s)]
*  maybe people are less manipulated by them. [[03:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11004.14s)]
*  I feel like right now, we're consuming content [[03:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11008.74s)]
*  like our parents respond to Nigerian credit card scams. [[03:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11011.9s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11016.94s)]
*  Like, I'm on the timeline, like, the Jews did what? [[03:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11017.78s)]
*  My parents are like, no, I just gotta pay the tax, [[03:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11021.34s)]
*  and then I get 10 million from this Nigerian print. [[03:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11024.1s)]
*  I am that susceptible to information. [[03:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11026.82s)]
*  And it's great. [[03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11028.86s)]
*  I intentionally don't click on things, [[03:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11029.7s)]
*  so I don't introduce any of that to my algorithm. [[03:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11032.140000000001s)]
*  So it's like, I almost have to buffer myself [[03:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11034.7s)]
*  from certain news or from certain free speakers, [[03:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11038.5s)]
*  just so it doesn't muddy up my timeline, [[03:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11041.02s)]
*  and it sucks, because I wanna see it all, [[03:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11043.82s)]
*  but then I don't wanna see. [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11045.380000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[03:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11046.34s)]
*  All that type of shit. [[03:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11047.18s)]
*  Did Ari ever tell you about the thing he did [[03:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11048.02s)]
*  when he took charge of his algorithm or whatever? [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11049.58s)]
*  Like Ari, it's such an Ari thing, [[03:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11054.26s)]
*  but he just did this experiment [[03:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11056.02s)]
*  where he wouldn't click or search anything [[03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11057.46s)]
*  except puppy videos for a month or something. [[03:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11060.38s)]
*  It was just all puppy videos, [[03:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11064.38s)]
*  and he actually got it to where the algorithm [[03:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11065.74s)]
*  was just showing him puppy videos, [[03:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11067.66s)]
*  and that's all it was. [[03:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11069.7s)]
*  And he was like, yeah, I was pretty happy for that month. [[03:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11071.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11073.3s)]
*  It was like, yeah, it had a good effect on me. [[03:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11074.14s)]
*  But it is a weird thing, too. [[03:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11076.38s)]
*  I don't believe that. [[03:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11077.5s)]
*  I believe it would be like puppies dressed as Hitler. [[03:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11078.5s)]
*  It's not all puppies. [[03:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11080.94s)]
*  It would be puppies, but it would be all the others [[03:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11083.14s)]
*  that Ari likes. [[03:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11085.1s)]
*  Well, I know just from doing such a deep dive [[03:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11086.46s)]
*  on the war in Gaza and just trying to keep up [[03:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11090.66s)]
*  with the news about it constantly at first, [[03:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11093.54s)]
*  it's like it was after a while [[03:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11095.46s)]
*  where I had to stop doing it on social media [[03:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11097.66s)]
*  because it's like, ah, dude, I can't watch. [[03:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11099.74s)]
*  Listen, I wanna be up on what's happening, [[03:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11101.9s)]
*  but I can't watch videos of me dying every day. [[03:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11103.78s)]
*  What am I doing to my soul right now [[03:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11106.86s)]
*  to just be constantly seeing this? [[03:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11108.5s)]
*  We all gotta figure out how to navigate this. [[03:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11111.18s)]
*  At least though, to your point though, [[03:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11113.140000000001s)]
*  it's like I think that, [[03:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11114.34s)]
*  with Candace and with that space particular, [[03:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11119.5s)]
*  the one thing I am grateful to her, [[03:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11122.82s)]
*  I've had so many people coming at me [[03:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11125.94s)]
*  for just being on there. [[03:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11129.460000000001s)]
*  And the crazy thing, and this is what bugs me, [[03:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11131.300000000001s)]
*  is it's not even the people coming at me [[03:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11133.380000000001s)]
*  are disagreeing with anything I said on there. [[03:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11135.86s)]
*  But the fact that you're associated with her. [[03:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11139.1s)]
*  They're just like, how could you be there [[03:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11139.94s)]
*  with this person? [[03:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11141.18s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, but I don't really do [[03:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11142.140000000001s)]
*  that guilt by association thing, man. [[03:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11143.42s)]
*  I don't believe in that. [[03:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11145.34s)]
*  And then also it's like, well, if we're gonna play this game, [[03:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11146.42s)]
*  then let's play it out. [[03:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11148.62s)]
*  Who do you have on? [[03:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11149.980000000001s)]
*  And what have they supported? [[03:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11150.900000000001s)]
*  And what have they, and it's like, okay, yeah, [[03:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11151.980000000001s)]
*  on the side that's critical of Israel, [[03:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11154.980000000001s)]
*  there are people who have said bad things about Jews. [[03:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11157.58s)]
*  On the side that's pro-Israel, [[03:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11159.980000000001s)]
*  there's a lot of people who have said [[03:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11161.34s)]
*  real bad things about Palestinians. [[03:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11162.18s)]
*  Okay, I can't not talk to anyone. [[03:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11165.019999999999s)]
*  I've talked to lots of people who are pro-Israel too. [[03:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11167.82s)]
*  But also, look, Candace does say over and over again, [[03:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11171.22s)]
*  maybe she's wrong on some of the conspiracies [[03:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11175.779999999999s)]
*  that she is talking about. [[03:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11178.019999999999s)]
*  But she does say over and over again [[03:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11179.34s)]
*  that she has no problem with Jewish people [[03:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11181.1s)]
*  and she doesn't hate Jewish people. [[03:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11182.98s)]
*  She loves, she has lots of Jewish friends. [[03:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11184.34s)]
*  She's always had lots of Jewish friends. [[03:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11185.98s)]
*  And I do appreciate that she's at least saying that. [[03:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11189.06s)]
*  And the way I look at it is it's always like, [[03:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11192.34s)]
*  oh yeah, you try to silence these people. [[03:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11194.46s)]
*  It's like some Freudian thing. [[03:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11197.3s)]
*  You repress something, it always kind of re-emerges [[03:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11198.779999999999s)]
*  in an uglier fashion and you're like, okay, [[03:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11201.74s)]
*  you try to suppress this one, watch it re-emerge [[03:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11204.74s)]
*  as someone who's not saying that anymore. [[03:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11207.3s)]
*  And now they're just like, no, like all of them. [[03:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11208.98s)]
*  And so- [[03:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11211.9s)]
*  I think that's part of what got Trump elected. [[03:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11212.74s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, maybe. [[03:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11214.38s)]
*  And so I think that the way it should be handled [[03:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11216.46s)]
*  is like if those guys are saying something [[03:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11222.779999999999s)]
*  that's so wrong and offensive, then it's like, [[03:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11224.74s)]
*  all right, so take them on and win the argument. [[03:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11226.779999999999s)]
*  If it's so wrong, it should be really easy [[03:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11229.58s)]
*  to just destroy their whole thing. [[03:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11231.619999999999s)]
*  And I'm not saying the marketplace of ideas is perfect, [[03:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11234.3s)]
*  but it's better than the alternative. [[03:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11237.46s)]
*  Which is the restriction of all. [[03:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11240.06s)]
*  Yeah, it's dictated from top down [[03:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11241.06s)]
*  what is the truth and what isn't. [[03:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11243.98s)]
*  This is the price we gotta pay for it. [[03:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11245.42s)]
*  Have you seen the people getting arrested in England [[03:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11247.38s)]
*  and I think even in Canada for the things [[03:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11249.859999999999s)]
*  that they've said, I don't remember the exact details. [[03:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11252.98s)]
*  Facebook posts or whatever. [[03:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11254.539999999999s)]
*  There's a guy recently just got arrested in- [[03:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11256.38s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know much more than that. [[03:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11257.859999999999s)]
*  Like I basically read that that was happening. [[03:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11259.38s)]
*  And that's the thing, like they have freedom of expression [[03:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11261.539999999999s)]
*  or whatever it is, but that's a bullshit way of saying, [[03:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11263.9s)]
*  you can't say what you want. [[03:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11266.22s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[03:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11267.3s)]
*  Yeah, go express it. [[03:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11268.46s)]
*  I am expressing with my words, well not that, you can't. [[03:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11269.38s)]
*  I think that's a really, really dangerous path to go down. [[03:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11271.939999999999s)]
*  Is that, and look, what happened in Canada, [[03:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11275.98s)]
*  I know this is, you said the Trump assassinations [[03:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11279.740000000002s)]
*  30 years ago, so this is like 500 years ago, [[03:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11281.94s)]
*  but it isn't actually, it's only a couple years ago. [[03:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11284.380000000001s)]
*  The way they cracked down on those trucker protests [[03:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11287.58s)]
*  was really insane. [[03:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11290.34s)]
*  Taking the credit cards and stuff. [[03:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11291.62s)]
*  Seizing bank accounts and then seizing the bank accounts [[03:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11293.060000000001s)]
*  of people who donated money to them. [[03:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11296.34s)]
*  Like not even like you were out there or did anything, [[03:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11298.54s)]
*  but you were just like, hey, I'm gonna throw a few bucks [[03:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11300.7s)]
*  to this cause, you're like, geez, this is freaking creepy. [[03:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11302.62s)]
*  We don't wanna go in that direction. [[03:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11305.980000000001s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[03:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11307.820000000002s)]
*  Are there any countries you feel are doing it, [[03:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11308.740000000002s)]
*  like any countries or governments you feel [[03:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11310.980000000001s)]
*  that are doing it right, that America would be like, [[03:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11312.460000000001s)]
*  yeah, we should maybe model ourselves [[03:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11314.5s)]
*  like what they're doing. Or the closest to right. [[03:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11316.58s)]
*  Closest to right. [[03:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11317.740000000002s)]
*  I'm a big fan of Liechtenstein. [[03:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11318.820000000002s)]
*  Really like what they're doing over there. [[03:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11321.94s)]
*  Very low taxes. [[03:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11323.78s)]
*  No, I don't know. [[03:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11324.86s)]
*  I mean, it's, all of them have their own problems. [[03:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11325.86s)]
*  I don't know that there's any country that I, [[03:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11329.7s)]
*  the country that I model that I'd like us to be a lot more [[03:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11332.060000000001s)]
*  is the United States of America. [[03:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11335.820000000002s)]
*  Like that's like what we were always kind of supposed to be [[03:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11338.58s)]
*  and what I think in many ways we did a better job [[03:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11341.539999999999s)]
*  of in the past. [[03:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11344.5s)]
*  And there's obviously certain things we didn't do a good job [[03:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11345.34s)]
*  of in the past, but I think that like, you know, [[03:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11348.22s)]
*  so I'm 41 and I just, I was born in a pre-War on Terror [[03:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11351.859999999999s)]
*  America, like a pre-911 America. [[03:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11357.019999999999s)]
*  Remember all those rom-coms where they would always end [[03:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11359.699999999999s)]
*  with the guy running up to the plane? [[03:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11361.9s)]
*  You could run up to a plane. [[03:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11364.939999999999s)]
*  You could just go in the air, [[03:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11366.58s)]
*  like we weren't all treated like terrorists and stuff. [[03:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11367.86s)]
*  And we didn't have this like these crushing deficits [[03:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11369.9s)]
*  and these endless wars and these like, you know, [[03:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11373.86s)]
*  like unprotected borders and all of this stuff. [[03:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11376.38s)]
*  And I think we could just go back to being like more [[03:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11378.9s)]
*  of a free country. [[03:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11381.78s)]
*  I think like, honestly, to me, I think the Declaration [[03:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11383.74s)]
*  of Independence is like the most amazing document [[03:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11386.94s)]
*  that's ever been written in the history of the world. [[03:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11390.5s)]
*  And like, that's our founding document. [[03:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11392.94s)]
*  Let's try to live up to that. [[03:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11394.82s)]
*  That's the example I'd like to follow. [[03:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11396.7s)]
*  Okay, last question. [[03:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11398.9s)]
*  How did the Jews kill JFK? [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11401.06s)]
*  Okay, so once you can control the weather, you say, [[03:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11403.539999999999s)]
*  everything else. [[03:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11408.539999999999s)]
*  Nice and sunny, we'll say. [[03:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11409.94s)]
*  You got magic bullet really. [[03:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11411.5s)]
*  A little fog would have rolled in. [[03:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11412.74s)]
*  No comment, but if you want to find out the answer, [[03:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11414.619999999999s)]
*  I'll be on a Spaces with Candace Owens. [[03:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11416.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11418.619999999999s)]
*  What was she saying? [[03:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11419.9s)]
*  And is that a real conspiracy? [[03:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11420.86s)]
*  Or is this like just trolling? [[03:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11423.58s)]
*  No, there's a real conspiracy that Israel was involved [[03:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11424.740000000002s)]
*  in the JFK assassination. [[03:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11427.980000000001s)]
*  Again, it all, like I do not, this is not a claim [[03:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11429.58s)]
*  I'm making at all, but there is a conspiracy out there [[03:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11432.7s)]
*  that that, I think there is evidence that the Israelis [[03:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11435.220000000001s)]
*  were attempting to blackmail Alan Dulles, [[03:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11439.140000000001s)]
*  as we said before. [[03:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11443.62s)]
*  That would be the connection there. [[03:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11444.94s)]
*  Alan Dulles was fired from the CIA by Jack Kennedy [[03:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11446.66s)]
*  because he was furious at him, [[03:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11451.980000000001s)]
*  because he was totally working against him. [[03:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11453.22s)]
*  And it was a big thing, but JFK fired the head of the CIA [[03:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11455.3s)]
*  and supposedly, and Bobby Kennedy told me this is true, [[03:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11459.46s)]
*  that he said he's gonna crack the CIA into a million pieces, [[03:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11465.3s)]
*  like that he was basically like, [[03:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11469.46s)]
*  I'm going to war with the CIA, [[03:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11470.939999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna like destroy this organization. [[03:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11472.779999999999s)]
*  And then he took a nice limo ride through Dallas. [[03:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11475.26s)]
*  And then on the Warren Commission, [[03:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11478.779999999999s)]
*  which was to investigate what happened [[03:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11482.02s)]
*  in the Kennedy assassination, [[03:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11484.58s)]
*  they put Alan Dulles on the commission. [[03:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11485.7s)]
*  Which is just like the biggest like signal of like, [[03:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11488.300000000001s)]
*  yeah, oh, we'll be looking into this, you know? [[03:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11491.34s)]
*  So I think the theory is extrapolated from, [[03:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11493.78s)]
*  oh, they had Alan Dulles blackmailed [[03:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11497.220000000001s)]
*  and therefore the Israelis. [[03:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11499.9s)]
*  There were issues between David Ben-Gurion [[03:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11501.060000000001s)]
*  and John F. Kennedy. [[03:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11503.380000000001s)]
*  He was very upset at them over like nuclear testing [[03:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11504.34s)]
*  or something. [[03:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11506.98s)]
*  I don't know that conspiracy that well inside and out, [[03:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11507.82s)]
*  but anyway, that's the theory. [[03:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11510.42s)]
*  Again, with all this thing, [[03:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11512.7s)]
*  I think the thing to keep in mind here, [[03:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11513.58s)]
*  and then by the way, [[03:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11515.62s)]
*  all the real hardcore like anti-Semites, [[03:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11516.460000000001s)]
*  this is where they'll say, [[03:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11519.5s)]
*  see, this is why Dave's working for the Jews too, [[03:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11520.62s)]
*  because he's just telling you [[03:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11522.78s)]
*  to tone down the temperature or whatever. [[03:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11523.74s)]
*  But even if the Israeli government was involved in that, [[03:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11525.94s)]
*  it's like, yeah, governments do evil things. [[03:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11529.62s)]
*  That's like all over the place. [[03:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11531.5s)]
*  It doesn't mean you gotta blame, you know, [[03:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11532.82s)]
*  Barry the dentist who lives on the block. [[03:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11535.18s)]
*  He didn't have anything to do with that, I promise you. [[03:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11537.78s)]
*  And he does really good work. [[03:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11539.980000000001s)]
*  He does. [[03:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11541.06s)]
*  But you're gonna pay for that work. [[03:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11541.9s)]
*  Dave Smith, ladies and gentlemen. [[03:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odkwbZ3lyc&t=11544.019999999999s)]
