*  What's up everybody welcome to Flaygrid and look the world is in chaos and there's only one man who can probably make sense of it all and we got Michael Mallis. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=0.0s)]
*  Hey! [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=7.0s)]
*  Thanks so much guys. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=8.0s)]
*  Michael thank you so much for coming here and being so opinionated about your musical taste. I walked back from the bathroom and there's like a there's a there's a there's a putty riot going on out here because Mark assumed you like Simon and Garfunkel. Why was this offensive? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=9.0s)]
*  Because it's like a blood libel like I mean Simon and Garfunkel. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=23.0s)]
*  You're a big old Jew! [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=26.0s)]
*  Yeah but I have good musical taste. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=28.0s)]
*  So do the Jews. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=30.0s)]
*  Yeah but I have good musical taste. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=32.0s)]
*  But you don't think the Jews have good musical taste? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=34.0s)]
*  I'm not here as the representative of the Jews. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=36.0s)]
*  Well then stop the pot. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=39.0s)]
*  This is what we need. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=40.0s)]

*  I don't think I listen to any music that's older than I am from 76. Anything before that I don't really like. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=45.0s)]
*  Just give us something. Give us something that you like. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=52.0s)]
*  I mean okay here's the thing. Here's the trick. I'm not even joking. Okay. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=54.0s)]

*  I'm just saying. There's a lot of explaining going on. I just asked for a group and you could just tell me. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=60.0s)]
*  Because you're not going to have heard of them. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=66.0s)]
*  How do you know I haven't heard of them? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=68.0s)]

*  Okay. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=83.0s)]
*  The point is the key to being a good hipster is listening to music other people have heard of. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=84.0s)]
*  Are you a hipster? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=90.0s)]

*  I need to understand what was happening before. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=104.0s)]
*  It was hard to find a shoe to match this retro print. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=105.0s)]
*  So you stole a homeless guy's shoe? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=108.0s)]
*  No I had these shoes for 20 years. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=110.0s)]

*  Do you think they have color in Russia? They have yellow shoes? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=119.0s)]
*  Yeah probably not. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=123.0s)]
*  Maybe okay. Maybe maybe not. Yellow shoes. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=124.0s)]

*  Okay listen. Can we make sense of the world now? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=135.0s)]

*  No but he wore a shiny suit for Diddy. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=139.0s)]
*  Oh hell yeah. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=142.0s)]
*  We had to explain that you wore Diddy to him earlier before the podcast. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=143.0s)]
*  Which some people could say is racist. I wouldn't say it is. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=147.0s)]
*  I still think you're trolling. I'm not really sure. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=150.0s)]
*  Do you think this is where Diddy's hiding? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=152.0s)]
*  The one place nobody will find him. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=153.0s)]
*  I'm gonna run right now. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=155.0s)]
*  He's Alex Media. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=156.0s)]
*  Listen he's either Diddy or Trudeau. It's one of the two. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=158.0s)]
*  The man is good. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=162.0s)]
*  I'm Trudeau. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=163.0s)]
*  The man is good. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=164.0s)]
*  He does both. He does both. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=165.0s)]
*  Malice can you make sense of the world? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=166.0s)]
*  No. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=168.0s)]
*  Come on. We brought you here to be completely serious and not use sarcasm at all. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=169.0s)]
*  Yes we did. That's all we want from you. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=173.0s)]
*  This is serious business. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=175.0s)]
*  Just give us back story. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=177.0s)]
*  Can I tell you a back story? This is actually really really funny. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=178.0s)]
*  So there's a difference between being angry and having your feelings hurt right? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=181.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=185.0s)]
*  So if I lend a friend money and they don't pay me back I'm angry. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=186.0s)]
*  But if I ask someone for a favor and they don't want to do it my feelings are hurt. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=190.0s)]
*  But like I get it. They don't owe me anything right? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=193.0s)]
*  So there were two shows that I wanted to do when I was doing the Roller for the White Pill. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=195.0s)]
*  People who I thought had a good relationship. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=199.0s)]
*  No one owes me to be on their show. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=200.0s)]
*  People ask me to be on my show all the time. I don't do it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=202.0s)]
*  No one owes me shit. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=204.0s)]
*  We had a good relationship. There's two people. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=205.0s)]
*  I reach out to you. I'm like hey I'd love to do the show. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=207.0s)]

*  There was a horrible terror attack. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=269.0s)]

*  Who does that serve more than China and Russia? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=288.0s)]

*  You're an Austin Texan. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=529.44s)]
*  That's the kind you are, which is not really, not really. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=530.96s)]
*  But you're here. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=533.96s)]
*  I know. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=534.96s)]
*  Oh, that was, that was, and you pronounce it differently. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=535.96s)]
*  You pronounce it Houston Street. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=538.96s)]
*  Whereas it's Houston Street. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=541.96s)]
*  No, you actually said it earlier as Houston Street. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=544.96s)]
*  Yeah, because I'm in New York. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=546.96s)]
*  Now that you're on camera don't chip it up. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=547.96s)]
*  Wait, you called it Houston Street? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=548.96s)]
*  Yeah, he tried to do a joke and he called it Houston Street. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=549.96s)]
*  Okay, okay, just making sure. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=552.96s)]
*  He was like, I've been in Texas so long I call it Houston Street. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=553.96s)]
*  I fucked it up off the camera, but I fixed it on camera. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=556.96s)]
*  You're a fraud, dude. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=560.48s)]
*  And I'm hugging you. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=561.48s)]
*  You're a fraud. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=562.48s)]
*  Damn, you really fucking riled Akash up. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=563.48s)]
*  I haven't seen him this riled up in ages. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=565.48s)]
*  Why do you rile everyone up? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=567.48s)]
*  Yeah, why do you rile everybody up? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=568.48s)]
*  What is the purpose of all this? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=569.48s)]
*  What are you seeking? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=570.48s)]

*  I'll see you out there. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=630.52s)]
*  AkashSingh.com. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=631.52s)]
*  What do you think about X? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=632.52s)]
*  What is the future of X? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=633.52s)]
*  I love X. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=634.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=635.52s)]
*  It lends itself to your skills, though. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=636.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=639.52s)]
*  I think the great thing about X is people always like, look, a majority of people don't agree [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=640.52s)]
*  with us. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=644.02s)]
*  And I go, you don't need a majority. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=645.04s)]
*  You need an alternative. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=646.04s)]
*  So if there had been one social media site, for example, during COVID, where scientists [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=647.04s)]
*  could be like, this isn't making sense. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=653.04s)]
*  I don't mean us randos. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=654.04s)]
*  I mean, people like Dr. Drew being like, I don't understand this. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=655.04s)]
*  And without having fear of being censored, right away, the whole dynamic changes. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=659.04s)]
*  Can you walk me through the logic? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=664.04s)]
*  OK, walk me through both logic. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=666.04s)]
*  Logics? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=669.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=670.04s)]
*  OK, walk me through both arguments, right? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=671.04s)]
*  Walk me through the argument that's like, hey, the Don Lemon argument, which is like, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=672.06s)]
*  hey, this platform should be responsible for the information on it. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=675.06s)]
*  And then walk me through the opposite. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=678.06s)]
*  I know it's an eye roll, but just take me through the thinking for both of them. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=679.06s)]
*  And if you could make your best argument for both. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=682.06s)]
*  I can steal that. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=684.06s)]
*  I just don't want to call it the Don Lemon argument because I think Don Lemon is like [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=685.06s)]
*  a soulless demon. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=688.06s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=689.06s)]
*  And who's just a very evil, malevolent person who's imminent, homeless. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=690.06s)]
*  In a rational society, he'd be living in fear for his life. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=694.06s)]
*  So let's not call it the Don Lemon argument. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=698.06s)]
*  Let's just call it the Blue Pill argument. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=700.06s)]
*  You're getting more Texan the more I listen to you. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=701.0799999999999s)]
*  You better run more. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=703.0799999999999s)]
*  You're not in a position to make jokes. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=706.0799999999999s)]
*  Just fucking dig in the grave, dude. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=711.0799999999999s)]
*  You've got to stand up for yourself, man. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=713.0799999999999s)]
*  I'm too much of a New Yorker now. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=715.0799999999999s)]
*  I can't stand up for myself. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=717.0799999999999s)]
*  I listen to you. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=719.0799999999999s)]
*  I can't stand up for myself. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=720.0799999999999s)]
*  That's so not New York. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=722.0799999999999s)]
*  I got a new booster. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=723.0799999999999s)]
*  I'll walk down. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=724.0799999999999s)]
*  OK, go, go, go, go. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=725.0799999999999s)]
*  So the argument is, it's a not complicated argument, that crazy ideas are often attractive [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=726.1s)]
*  to people because they're innovative, never heard it before. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=733.1s)]
*  And it's like smoking cigarettes in school. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=736.1s)]
*  You want to be the ones like, look at me, I'm smoking cigarettes in school and getting [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=738.1s)]
*  away with it. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=741.1s)]
*  So it can snowball and lead to crazy kind of consequences, which especially people who [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=742.1s)]
*  are marginalized in some way, they're the ones who are going to pay the price because [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=747.1s)]
*  they can't speak up for themselves. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=750.1s)]
*  Right? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=751.1s)]
*  That's the not Don Lemon argument. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=752.1s)]
*  That is the argument for some form of censorship. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=754.12s)]
*  Or some form of consensus. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=757.12s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=758.12s)]
*  The other argument is the person, and this isn't the arguments popularly made, but this [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=759.12s)]
*  argument I would make, the smartest person on earth is going to be ignorant of 99% of [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=764.12s)]
*  knowledge. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=769.12s)]
*  So even if you're brilliant, like I can know, I can be a very smart guy. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=770.12s)]
*  If I go to a farm, that farmer, let's suppose there's a farmer where the guy's really dumb, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=774.12s)]
*  he's going to run circles around me about the farming and produce and all these other [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=778.12s)]
*  things. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=781.12s)]
*  And it's not even going to be a question or any other circumstance where someone who may [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=782.14s)]
*  be not as bright as me can run circles around me in any field. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=785.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=788.14s)]
*  So when you have someone who's going to be the censor, how are they, like any filter, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=789.14s)]
*  you want to keep out stuff that you don't want and a lot of stuff that goes in. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=794.14s)]
*  But it's going to be really hard to set up that field to make sure what gets through [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=798.14s)]
*  is what should get through. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=802.14s)]
*  And how do you make sure those people aren't corrupt? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=803.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=805.14s)]
*  It's really this kind of very arrogant attitude that doesn't really work. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=806.16s)]
*  And the other thing is these people are living in a world where the internet doesn't exist [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=812.16s)]
*  because if you just control like four or five outlets, you can't just censor the internet. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=816.16s)]
*  Like if we could, we wouldn't have child porn. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=821.16s)]
*  That's a really obvious example. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=823.16s)]
*  There's a complete consensus or until five minutes ago that child pornography is an abomination. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=825.16s)]
*  We can't have it. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=829.16s)]
*  But the FBI doesn't have, I think it's the FBI, CIA, whatever group it was, they don't [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=830.16s)]
*  have enough agents to fight babies, videos of babies being assaulted. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=834.18s)]
*  So this is if you want to talk about free speech and like this is something we all agree on [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=839.18s)]
*  or most of us, the sane ones. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=844.18s)]
*  And yet we can't even control that. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=846.18s)]
*  So they think they have a monopoly on the mic and they don't. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=848.18s)]
*  So then just so I can clarify, the argument is essentially it is impossible to properly [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=851.18s)]
*  police speech. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=858.18s)]
*  Therefore, the better option is to not police it at all. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=860.18s)]
*  Well, especially when it comes to political discourse. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=863.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=865.1999999999999s)]
*  Got it. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=866.1999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=867.1999999999999s)]
*  So then it's not really this argument of or this discussion about. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=868.1999999999999s)]
*  And I'm also going to say we got to try what we can to fight. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=871.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm not saying we should have child porn. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=874.1999999999999s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=875.1999999999999s)]
*  I just want to be clear for everyone. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=876.1999999999999s)]
*  I didn't want to position it in terms of child porn. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=877.1999999999999s)]
*  I want to position it because I think a lot of people obviously are looking at this as [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=879.1999999999999s)]
*  a binary. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=882.1999999999999s)]
*  Censorship is only good if it actually works. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=883.1999999999999s)]
*  And it's impossible to get it to work. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=884.1999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=886.1999999999999s)]
*  And because it's impossible to get it to work, the lesser of these two, and I don't even [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=887.1999999999999s)]
*  want to call them evil. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=889.1999999999999s)]
*  Situations. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=890.1999999999999s)]
*  The lesser of these two situations is a complete lack thereof. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=891.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=894.22s)]
*  And that's assuming that. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=895.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=896.22s)]
*  I think that's a better argument. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=897.22s)]
*  And I think that's way more digestible because I think a lot of times the way it's positioned [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=898.22s)]
*  is this is this leads to all good and there are no problems with this at all. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=901.22s)]
*  And then people start chipping away and go, hey, there are some problems. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=905.22s)]
*  People don't understand tradeoffs in this country. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=908.22s)]
*  But the other thing is this is also assuming. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=910.22s)]
*  Is that an American cultural thing? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=912.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=913.22s)]
*  I think people also assume that's also what I just said, assumes that the people in power [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=914.22s)]
*  are genuinely good people who want everything well, as opposed to they should be hanging [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=918.24s)]
*  from lampposts. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=921.24s)]
*  Can you look up the C.S. Lewis quote, C.S. Lewis conscience? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=922.24s)]
*  If the worst thing about our government is that it's like people are getting bribes, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=925.24s)]
*  we'd be in a utopia. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=929.24s)]
*  Really? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=931.24s)]
*  People in power are so beyond depraved and exist on a level of evil that we can't wrap [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=932.24s)]
*  our heads around that if it was just like someone's hiring their brother-in-law and [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=937.24s)]
*  getting a kickback, this would be fine. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=941.24s)]
*  Can you read the quote? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=943.24s)]
*  Like, I want to get exactly right. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=944.24s)]
*  Of all tyrannies, the tyranny exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=945.26s)]
*  It may be better to live under robber barons, corrupt people, than under omnipotent moral [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=949.26s)]
*  busybodies. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=954.26s)]
*  The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, but those who torment us for our own good [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=955.26s)]
*  will torment us without end, for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=961.26s)]
*  So I don't think the people in government are corrupt. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=965.26s)]
*  I think they are fundamentally evil and depraved. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=967.26s)]
*  And it is the one of the things I talked about in my book, the white pill, that is the most [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=970.26s)]
*  I talked about in my book, the white pill, is they were covering up genocides. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=974.28s)]
*  And there's no question of like, let's suppose, God forbid, we did something where like millions [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=978.28s)]
*  of people died and we fucked it up. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=982.28s)]
*  We would be like, like even if we were just chefs, we undercook a chicken, someone dies. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=983.28s)]
*  For the rest of our lives, we'd be like, how did I fucking get this wrong? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=988.28s)]
*  The next day, we got to sit down. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=991.28s)]
*  This can never happen again. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=993.28s)]
*  But there's never this thing of how do we fuck it up? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=994.28s)]
*  They don't feel guilt. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=996.28s)]
*  They don't feel remorse. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=997.28s)]
*  They are fundamentally depraved. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=998.28s)]
*  And I think part of the work I've been doing is people in America who are naive about the [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1000.3s)]
*  nature of evil, who think it's a guy with a mustache banging his fist on the table when [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1005.3s)]
*  it's really that bureaucrat who won't give you medicine just because they have a little [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1008.3s)]
*  bit of power. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1012.3s)]
*  They're starting to realize, oh, it's not just fucking Hunter Biden getting a fucking [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1013.3s)]
*  job. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1017.3s)]
*  These people are fundamentally. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1018.3s)]
*  Here's another. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1019.3s)]
*  And you think sorry to interrupt, but you think it's because they've convinced themselves [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1020.3s)]
*  they're doing it for our own good. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1023.3s)]
*  Vivek said this about the man-gero class. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1024.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1027.3s)]
*  Here's like another example. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1028.32s)]
*  Let's talk about this, like the kiddie stuff. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1029.32s)]
*  I was thinking with like, OK, maybe it's like someone's got a crush on high school cheerleaders [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1032.32s)]
*  and there's a conversation about the sexualization of teens in America. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1037.32s)]
*  And then you see a CNN's producer was arrested because he was bragging on a message board [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1040.32s)]
*  and not even talking about how this message board exists about the infants he was assaulting. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1045.32s)]
*  And it's like, I tried to meet you halfway, but that is a level of evil that I don't think [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1049.32s)]
*  anyone in this room can wrap their heads around. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1054.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1056.32s)]
*  And I think most of us assume it just doesn't exist. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1057.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1059.34s)]
*  And it exists a lot. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1060.34s)]
*  And I think these people do it just because they can. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1061.34s)]
*  This Epstein Island shit. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1063.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1065.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1066.34s)]
*  Continue on this. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1067.34s)]
*  This is actually really interesting. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1068.34s)]
*  So you're saying that there's like there's a group of people and not a group of people [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1069.34s)]
*  that even know one another, but they all have that same lust for power and they have the [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1072.34s)]
*  same sociopathy that allows them to have no guilt or remorse. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1075.34s)]
*  And they do evil because they can and they enjoy getting off on it. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1080.34s)]
*  But is it pathological? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1083.34s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1084.34s)]
*  I don't think it can fix them. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1085.34s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1086.36s)]
*  So no, no, meaning, meaning the doing evil, does it in some way bring them joy or making [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1087.36s)]
*  the decisions? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1092.36s)]
*  It makes them feel powerful. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1093.36s)]
*  And they are powerful because if you commit, if I kill someone and I get away with it, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1094.36s)]
*  I'm at a whole other level than normal people. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1097.36s)]
*  Can you give us names of people that you think would fall under this description that we [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1099.36s)]
*  would be aware of? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1104.36s)]
*  Congress? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1107.36s)]
*  I think many people in Congress. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1109.36s)]
*  But I mean, I think a lot of times Congress is just the public face, don't you? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1111.36s)]
*  I think most of them are. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1114.36s)]
*  But I think that just because you're a public face doesn't mean that you don't have a lust [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1115.3799999999999s)]
*  for power. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1118.3799999999999s)]
*  I think, I think. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1119.3799999999999s)]
*  I think if you get into government, there is a lust for it. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1120.3799999999999s)]
*  If you, if you, I agree. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1122.3799999999999s)]
*  I think if you look at powerful names in Hollywood, some of these rumors get through, you know, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1124.3799999999999s)]
*  these names get named. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1130.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1131.3799999999999s)]
*  And I think that a lot of these people's faces we wouldn't know. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1132.3799999999999s)]
*  We wouldn't know. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1136.3799999999999s)]
*  Like I bet you they released Epstein's book. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1137.3799999999999s)]
*  We wouldn't know half of these names. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1139.3799999999999s)]
*  You're saying the true power brokers that we don't understand. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1141.3799999999999s)]
*  Because there's the power of like, look, I'm a celebrity, I'm famous. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1144.4s)]
*  Which is not what they're interested in. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1147.4s)]
*  Of course. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1148.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1149.4s)]
*  Because it's not real power. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1150.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1151.4s)]
*  That's. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1152.4s)]
*  Does anyone really think Biden's running the fucking federal government? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1153.4s)]
*  Who does run the federal government? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1154.4s)]
*  I don't fucking know. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1155.4s)]
*  Isn't that interesting? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1156.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1157.4s)]
*  Does anyone really think it's Biden? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1158.4s)]
*  No. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1159.4s)]
*  Like no one thinks it's with a straight face. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1160.4s)]
*  You could say Trump sucks, I want Biden, I want Sandy in the White House, but he's not [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1161.4s)]
*  making these fucking decisions. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1164.4s)]
*  So. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1165.4s)]
*  He's only deciding when to ring the bell when his diaper's full. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1166.4s)]
*  So again. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1169.4s)]
*  He's ringing it a lot. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1170.4s)]
*  I don't think anybody's making, even when Trump was president, I think that there are [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1171.42s)]
*  a bunch of people that are assisting him in making the decisions. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1175.42s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1178.42s)]
*  But I think that that would be the same case for any business, right? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1179.42s)]
*  You're going to have a board of executives that are going to help you make these decisions [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1181.42s)]
*  and ultimately you're going to have to make the fucking tough ones and that is the responsibility [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1185.42s)]
*  of the president. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1188.42s)]
*  I don't know if Biden is even doing it. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1189.42s)]
*  Sure. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1191.42s)]
*  He's a figurehead. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1192.42s)]
*  Fine. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1193.42s)]
*  The fact that we don't even know the people that are advising him is a little bit concerning. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1194.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1197.42s)]
*  I mean, would it make a difference if we did? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1198.42s)]
*  I think so. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1199.42s)]
*  I think so. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1200.44s)]
*  Because we could. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1201.44s)]
*  What power do we have? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1202.44s)]
*  Well, it's not about power. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1203.44s)]
*  It's about holding people accountable. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1204.44s)]
*  There's no accountability. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1205.44s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1206.44s)]
*  I'm saying us as voters. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1207.44s)]
*  Voted. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1208.44s)]
*  Oh God. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1209.44s)]
*  Voters. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1210.44s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1211.44s)]
*  Listen, listen, listen. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1212.44s)]
*  And some of this you have to submit to the illusion of the democracy. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1213.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1215.44s)]
*  If you're going to submit all you want. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1216.44s)]
*  No. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1218.44s)]
*  I'm the one getting the blow job. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1219.44s)]
*  Not, not, not submit, meaning you have to take part in it. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1220.44s)]
*  But in order to properly communicate with the people that are reading your books, they believe [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1224.44s)]
*  in a system. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1228.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1229.46s)]
*  So you have to at least meet them halfway at the system they believe in before you can [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1230.46s)]
*  tell them, hey, all this shit is bullshit. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1232.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1234.46s)]
*  Sure. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1235.46s)]
*  Sure. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1236.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1237.46s)]
*  No, I get you. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1238.46s)]
*  You're talking in their house. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1239.46s)]
*  Not your house. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1240.46s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1241.46s)]
*  And then once they understand your house, now you don't need to talk about your house at [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1242.46s)]
*  all. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1243.46s)]
*  You at least need to invite them in. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1244.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1245.46s)]
*  So the idea for a great way to explain persuasion of people. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1246.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1248.46s)]
*  So it's like superb. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1249.46s)]
*  So right now we have for this Biden situation, I think the average person is probably the [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1250.46s)]
*  closest they've ever been. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1254.46s)]
*  The average person that's in their house is the closest they've ever been to your house. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1255.46s)]
*  Meaning they're knocking on the door going, I'll tell them in one sentence, we're not [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1258.48s)]
*  voting our way out of this. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1262.48s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1264.48s)]
*  It means just think about it. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1265.48s)]
*  Like if you think that this choice you make in November, like if you make, you have to [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1266.48s)]
*  look at it really carefully. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1270.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1271.48s)]
*  And if you make that right choice, this problem is going to be resolved or even ameliorated. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1272.48s)]
*  If you stop and think about it for five minutes, I don't think anyone who's quasi rational [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1276.48s)]
*  with a straight face would be like, wait, that makes no sense. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1279.48s)]
*  But explain what you mean by that. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1282.48s)]
*  Meaning that if you have Biden again, or if you have Trump. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1284.48s)]
*  We're in the same predicament. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1286.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1287.5s)]
*  So you don't see Trump as this great escape, this great rescue from. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1288.5s)]
*  We ran that experiment. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1293.5s)]
*  Like I don't understand. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1294.5s)]
*  It's not like he wasn't president before. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1295.5s)]
*  So why do people see it as such? [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1297.5s)]
*  Because they're told that there's this binary. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1299.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1301.5s)]
*  And if you don't like this team, you just got to, you got to like the other one. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1302.5s)]
*  Like people were told with a straight face that if you vote for Jill Stein, you're a [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1305.5s)]
*  Trump supporter, like Green Party people. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1308.5s)]
*  So and you're what's his name? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1310.5s)]
*  Noam Chomsky, who's a Trump supporter. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1313.5s)]
*  Noam Chomsky, who's another anarchist who are waiting to die so I can climb the ladder [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1315.52s)]
*  and beat. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1319.52s)]
*  No, that's all that's standing in my way. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1320.52s)]
*  So it's Noam Chomsky, Russell and then me. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1323.52s)]
*  So at least I'm on the platform. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1325.52s)]
*  Noam Chomsky has this whole point about the way to control a population is to have a very [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1327.52s)]
*  intense debate, but within strictly delineated parameters. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1331.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1334.52s)]
*  So if the answer is always going to be between like five and six and one through five and [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1335.52s)]
*  it doesn't matter who wins. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1339.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1341.52s)]
*  Oh, it's a genius. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1342.52s)]
*  So give us an example. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1343.52s)]
*  I have a great guy on the show. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1344.54s)]
*  I had him on my show. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1346.54s)]
*  He goes, it's like you turn on CNN and the question is, do we bomb the fuck out of Syria [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1347.54s)]
*  or do we bomb the living fuck out of Syria? [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1351.54s)]
*  And that's the range. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1353.54s)]
*  The view, you know, the Karen mothership. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1355.54s)]
*  That's that was Jimmy's example that he put together. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1357.54s)]
*  The Syria. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1359.54s)]
*  But the view, let me talk about the view. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1360.54s)]
*  I was just going to give Jimmy credits. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1362.54s)]
*  Oh, Jimmy's great. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1363.54s)]
*  Yeah, Jimmy's amazing. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1364.54s)]
*  So on the view, Kurt Metzger, who I'm sure you've heard, he goes, there's a reason I [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1365.54s)]
*  call the views. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1369.54s)]
*  The view is you have whoopi and joy hard left on the on one side. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1371.56s)]
*  And the closest thing you had to a Trump supporter was Meghan McCain, who denounced Trump at [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1375.56s)]
*  her dad's eulogy. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1380.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1381.56s)]
*  But that's if you're watching this as a female, that's your range of acceptable opinion. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1382.56s)]
*  So the way my friend put it was CNN is what you're supposed to think and Fox is what you're [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1385.56s)]
*  allowed to think. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1389.56s)]
*  But other than that, like that's your little box. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1390.56s)]
*  And labeling these other sides as extreme left or extreme right. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1392.56s)]
*  Is this all part of that? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1396.56s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1397.56s)]
*  That's the end of the box. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1398.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1399.56s)]
*  So you know where the borders are. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1400.58s)]
*  So what are some solutions? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1402.58s)]
*  Because you sound very black pill. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1404.58s)]
*  No, I'm white pill. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1406.58s)]
*  This. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1408.58s)]
*  Well, the first step is diagnosis. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1409.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1411.58s)]
*  Once you realize a lot of this, you can't start treatment for the cancer if you don't [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1412.58s)]
*  admit you have it. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1415.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1416.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1417.58s)]
*  Or recognize you have it. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1418.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1419.58s)]
*  That's that's really interesting. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1420.58s)]
*  We're debating something in such close proximity that if there were a powers that be, they [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1421.58s)]
*  really wouldn't give a fuck which side it went to. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1426.58s)]
*  You guys know magicians, right? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1428.6s)]
*  So the guy's dangling his keys here while he's picking your pocket. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1429.6s)]
*  Well, look at these keys. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1432.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1433.6s)]
*  So do we not have a civic duty to vote? [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1434.6s)]
*  Come to our house. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1438.6s)]
*  Come to our house. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1439.6s)]
*  Come to our house first. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1440.6s)]
*  Come on. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1441.6s)]
*  You're just laughing at us. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1442.6s)]
*  We can't go into your house if you just laugh at us. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1443.6s)]
*  Come to our house. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1445.6s)]
*  There's some kid that's listening that just turned 18. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1446.6s)]
*  It's like, man, I can't wait to vote in this election. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1447.6s)]
*  He's involved in his community. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1449.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1451.6s)]
*  If he would just got the right not to go home. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1452.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1454.6s)]
*  Chinese vote now. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1455.6s)]
*  Come on. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1456.62s)]
*  But not in China. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1457.62s)]
*  Oh no, they can vote for Mao. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1458.62s)]
*  All right. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1459.62s)]
*  I would never tell. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1460.62s)]
*  I'm not even joking. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1462.62s)]
*  I would not tell someone, especially a black person not to vote because it does mean something [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1463.62s)]
*  for certain communities, like in all seriousness. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1466.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1468.62s)]
*  But the opportunity costs that time it spends you to vote. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1469.62s)]
*  You could be adopting a dog, reading to an old person. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1471.62s)]
*  Bombing a postal office. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1474.62s)]
*  Not the postal office. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1476.62s)]
*  I can't advocate like violence against the government on camera. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1478.62s)]
*  But I'd also don't know how to finish the sentence. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1482.6399999999999s)]
*  Post office boss. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1484.6399999999999s)]
*  Zero people dead. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1485.6399999999999s)]
*  Who bombs up fucking postal office? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1487.6399999999999s)]
*  Postal workers. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1489.6399999999999s)]
*  They don't go to work. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1490.6399999999999s)]
*  They go postal. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1492.6399999999999s)]
*  Have you ever heard of the special? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1493.6399999999999s)]
*  Imagine they went in there as just the co-workers. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1495.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but that's free Amazon. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1497.6399999999999s)]
*  That was when it was like big. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1499.6399999999999s)]
*  You got to bomb the Amazon. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1501.6399999999999s)]
*  Don't do it. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1502.6399999999999s)]
*  Don't do it. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1503.6399999999999s)]
*  It's not Michael Mouse's fans. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1504.6399999999999s)]
*  Don't do it. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1506.6399999999999s)]
*  In all seriousness, the alternative is to vote for the president. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1507.6399999999999s)]
*  The alternative is local and be the best person you can be. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1511.66s)]
*  Be an asset to your community. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1516.66s)]
*  Be a good dad or friend or whatever. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1517.66s)]
*  And that is the alternative to this facade. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1519.66s)]
*  And not buying in. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1522.66s)]
*  There's not that much. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1523.66s)]
*  The lie of democracy is this idea that like the president really cares about what you think. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1524.66s)]
*  Like this. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1528.66s)]
*  How can he care about 300 million people? [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1529.66s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1530.66s)]
*  So have the kind of surrender prayer. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1531.66s)]
*  Know what you have control over and maximize what you have control over to the best of your ability. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1533.66s)]
*  Tolstoy had a book. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1539.66s)]
*  He's also an anarchist. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1540.68s)]
*  Yeah, anarchist. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1541.68s)]
*  The kingdom of God is within you, which is we don't need government. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1542.68s)]
*  But essentially we all follow Christ's nonviolence. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1545.68s)]
*  And if everybody buys into that, then non-government is possible. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1548.68s)]
*  But you still have kind of some authority there, which is God, Christ, whatever. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1552.68s)]
*  This is how we should all act in a moral way. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1556.68s)]
*  And now we don't need government. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1558.68s)]
*  You don't seem to have that. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1560.68s)]
*  And I really do like what you're saying theoretically, but there's nothing higher that we are called to to act morally. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1562.68s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1568.68s)]
*  Exactly correct. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1569.7s)]
*  Well, I have it. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1570.7s)]
*  There's a Tolstoy essay in the anarchist handbook. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1571.7s)]
*  He was this garbage anyway. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1573.7s)]
*  He was a Christian anarchist. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1574.7s)]
*  Yes, he's a Christian anarchist. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1575.7s)]
*  And that's I remember reading that book and being like, you know, this is great. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1577.7s)]
*  And he also seemed to kind of solve the problem of what still ends up governing our authority, which is God. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1580.7s)]
*  But I mean, the other issue is government is doing a very good job, especially in cities, of protecting criminals from their consequences, not protecting law abiding citizens. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1585.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1594.7s)]
*  So as a Texan, one of the reasons I lived in, you know, in Texas now is if someone breaks into my house, I don't have to worry about protecting my home. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1595.72s)]
*  You can shoot them. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1604.72s)]
*  Where I could shoot them. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1605.72s)]
*  Whereas here, I'd be the one going to jail. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1606.72s)]
*  And that's a complete inversion of like a basic decency of any society. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1608.72s)]
*  I'm not questioning your disdain of the government. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1612.72s)]
*  I completely get that. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1614.72s)]
*  What I'm asking for is because I... [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1615.72s)]
*  No, I'm just saying we need security. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1617.72s)]
*  A lot of people think anarchism means if you abolish the government monopoly on policing. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1619.72s)]
*  I'm just clarifying for them. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1623.72s)]
*  That's like, oh, you think everyone's going to be nice and no one's going to be a criminal? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1624.74s)]
*  No, I'm just saying... [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1627.74s)]
*  I think it's important to clarify. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1628.74s)]
*  Yeah, it's just important to know that like, no, criminals aren't going to be able on the street every five minutes. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1629.74s)]
*  They're going to be dealt with. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1634.74s)]
*  My fear of what you believe is the more you dive into it, they're still like I've heard you say music is anarchy. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1635.74s)]
*  There is no governing body in music. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1641.74s)]
*  But the second you try to make money in music, the music industry is incredibly corrupt. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1643.74s)]
*  Diddy is being charged for unspeakable crimes. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1649.74s)]
*  You are? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1651.74s)]
*  Really? [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1652.76s)]
*  You're one of those... [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1653.76s)]
*  Don't put that Diddy jacket on me. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1654.76s)]
*  If the jacket don't fit, you must acquit yourself. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1659.76s)]
*  If the jacket don't fit. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1661.76s)]
*  But in a capitalist society... [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1663.76s)]
*  I'm too chibin', I'm white bronco. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1665.76s)]
*  In a capitalist society, especially once financial reward is there, everybody's very corruptible and local government even then can be just as corruptible as... [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1668.76s)]
*  Not for local government. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1677.76s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1678.76s)]
*  Or local governance or whatever. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1679.76s)]
*  Whoever is that power within that small tribe, whoever gets power is essentially a dictator. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1680.78s)]
*  I think he's saying no power. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1685.78s)]
*  I think he's saying be a good neighbor. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1686.78s)]
*  Let's talk about the music thing. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1687.78s)]
*  I'm saying that music is an anarchist system because you don't have to listen to any music. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1688.78s)]
*  You don't want to. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1692.78s)]
*  Anyone can create music. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1693.78s)]
*  No one's saying it has to have four-four time. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1694.78s)]
*  It has to have an F clef, whatever. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1696.78s)]
*  S clef, I don't fucking know. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1697.78s)]
*  So cuisine is another example. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1698.78s)]
*  These are systems where millions of people over centuries voluntarily interacted, each contributed. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1700.78s)]
*  You can take part in it. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1706.78s)]
*  You can not take part in it. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1707.78s)]
*  Cuisine is not completely anarchist. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1708.78s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1709.8s)]
*  How is it not? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1710.8s)]
*  Who's the government? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1711.8s)]
*  The FDA. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1712.8s)]
*  There's a difference between cuisine meaning recipes and you can create whatever you want. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1713.8s)]
*  The point is governments interject themselves, but they're not creators or the ones who are [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1719.8s)]
*  making the system thrive. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1724.8s)]
*  I thought you were talking about currently what is happening in the culinary arts in [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1725.8s)]
*  America. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1729.8s)]
*  There are things you just can't eat. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1730.8s)]
*  You can't have non-pasteurized cheese. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1731.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1734.8s)]
*  My point is, sure. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1735.8s)]
*  And there's that weird cheese from Italy with the baguettes. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1736.82s)]
*  Point being cuisine, how it was created, language, how it was created, music. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1739.82s)]
*  Historically, sure. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1744.82s)]
*  I thought we were talking about. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1745.82s)]
*  So people say where does anarchism exist? [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1746.82s)]
*  Anarchism is a type of government. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1748.82s)]
*  It is a relationship. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1749.82s)]
*  And the creation of these systems across time, across the world, across centuries are examples [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1751.82s)]
*  of anarchism in practice. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1755.82s)]
*  So for example, with food, if you sell people food that kills them, eventually people stop [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1756.82s)]
*  buying your food and then that restaurant, that food booth, whatever it is, no longer [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1762.84s)]
*  exists. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1767.84s)]
*  Sure. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1768.84s)]
*  But that's not really an example of cuisine. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1769.84s)]
*  I'm just talking about the way that French cuisine developed, the way that now I can [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1770.84s)]
*  cook French cuisine in America if I just follow these recipes. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1773.84s)]
*  No one's putting a gun to my head. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1776.84s)]
*  No one's forcing me to add eight sticks of butter if I want to make a croissant. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1778.84s)]
*  These were all developed voluntarily through mutual interaction over time. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1782.84s)]
*  So that is what anarchism means in practice. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1786.84s)]
*  People always say, well, it's never happened this way. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1788.84s)]
*  It's not a type of government. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1790.86s)]
*  It's not a type of country. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1791.86s)]
*  It's a type of relationship where there's no governing authority overseeing its development. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1792.86s)]
*  Language is another example of this. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1796.86s)]
*  And I'm not even trying to pick at you. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1797.86s)]
*  I'm actually trying to make the connection just for them also. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1799.86s)]
*  I don't disagree with what you're saying. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1801.86s)]
*  In my brain, I'm not struggling with the practical application, especially with capitalism. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1803.86s)]
*  With capitalism, doesn't there need to be some kind of governance? [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1807.86s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1811.86s)]
*  But the point is, security is far too important to allow it for any monopoly. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1812.86s)]
*  Especially a government monopoly. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1818.8799999999999s)]
*  It's absolutely insane that in 2020, the police said we're not protecting you. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1820.8799999999999s)]
*  And the people who did try to protect their communities were the ones who were arrested. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1824.8799999999999s)]
*  That's what happens when you have a monopoly on security. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1828.8799999999999s)]
*  If you have a monopoly on food, people are starving. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1830.8799999999999s)]
*  If you have monopoly on education, people don't know how to read. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1833.8799999999999s)]
*  So when you say cuisine, when you say music, you don't mean how they're distributed in a country. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1835.8799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1843.8799999999999s)]
*  You just mean the creation, the history of the country. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1844.8799999999999s)]
*  The creation, the history of these things. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1847.9s)]
*  Got it. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1849.9s)]
*  That's where I was a little bit confused. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1850.9s)]
*  Because within different countries, there are different rules about cuisine. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1851.9s)]
*  In Canada, you can't have a medium rare hamburger or something like that. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1855.9s)]
*  But anarchism teaches that these rules are not morally legitimate. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1858.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1861.9s)]
*  Got it. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1862.9s)]
*  Now I'm understanding. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1863.9s)]
*  So there are these things that exist within the pure anarchist system. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1864.9s)]
*  And then your argument would be governments corrupt them. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1867.9s)]
*  And even the most pure anarchistic things can still be corrupted by a monopolistic approach from the government. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1871.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1878.92s)]
*  Just like it's insane that in New York, I can't defend my own home against a violent intruder. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1879.92s)]
*  It's absolutely crazy. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1884.92s)]
*  And it's only government that can make that happen. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1885.92s)]
*  And give me the argument. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1887.92s)]
*  If you were to make the argument, I know this is an eye roll, but if you were to make the argument for the government, what would you say? [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1888.92s)]
*  My strongest argument for government is food standards. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1895.92s)]
*  In that specific one about defending your own home. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1898.92s)]
*  What would you? [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1900.94s)]
*  Okay, if I had to steal men. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1901.94s)]
*  So here's the other thing. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1903.94s)]
*  That's it. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1904.94s)]
*  I'm going to ask the question one second. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1905.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1906.94s)]
*  A good way to know if someone is full of shit or if they're someone we're talking to is can you give the opposing position as strongly as possible? [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1907.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1914.94s)]
*  And if they can't walk away. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1915.94s)]
*  Because they're full of shit. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1916.94s)]
*  Because they're either full of shit or they're in bad faith that their brain doesn't work that way. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1917.94s)]
*  I can make the case. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1919.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1920.94s)]
*  The case is we all know just walking around New York, there's lots of crazy people. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1921.94s)]
*  Yep. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1925.94s)]
*  There's lots of people who just broke up with their wife and they want to come back and do something about it. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1926.96s)]
*  There's lots of kids. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1930.96s)]
*  Do you want it to be the case where every crazy homeless person has access to a gun? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1932.96s)]
*  What? [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1937.96s)]
*  No one's going to get killed. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1938.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1939.96s)]
*  So that's the that's the steel man argument for that. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1940.96s)]
*  And then you would even acknowledge that there is some sense to that. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1941.96s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1946.96s)]
*  Like I don't want every little crazy person to be in a position where they can just go and shoot up a school with no repercussions. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1947.96s)]
*  Another example is in New York, for example, like building laws, right? [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1954.98s)]
*  Maybe I'm sure in Texas or other places where you just have your property, you can more or less build whatever you want on it. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1957.98s)]
*  I'm sure there's some bureaucracy you have to deal with. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1962.98s)]
*  But in New York, everybody, somebody's next door above you, below you. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1964.98s)]
*  You have to consider them a little bit more. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1968.98s)]
*  The fire department coming in, there might be a closet that you put, but it's not on the map, et cetera. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1970.98s)]
*  So there are other people that deal with the repercussions of your building negligence, if you will. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1974.98s)]
*  So you acknowledge that maybe in certain cities or certain places, do you think should have more regulation or how would you solve for that problem? [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1980.0s)]
*  I think the regulation is a big problem in terms of you're not allowing enough people to build. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1989.0s)]
*  So the rents are going to be artificially high. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1994.0s)]
*  And this fucks over poor people the most. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1996.0s)]
*  Oh, no, no, not in that regard. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1998.0s)]
*  Like how would you solve that problem? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=1999.0s)]
*  Like you have the gun one in the city where these crazy people could get guns. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2001.0s)]
*  So you want to limit guns in some way for your safety. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2004.0s)]
*  Would you just take the risk? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2007.0s)]
*  Well, no, I think the issue is you have to limit the crazy people. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2008.02s)]
*  So the fact that you have these public streets and these guys can walk around when nothing is being done to them is the problem. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2011.02s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2017.02s)]
*  OK, so that's that's what was the guy who got Jordan was in Jordan nearly who was the one who was like, yeah, he just punched an old lady in the face and broke her orbital socket. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2018.02s)]
*  And he's out in the street. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2025.02s)]
*  What the fuck are we talking about? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2026.02s)]
*  So who decides crazy and how long you should be locked down for being crazy? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2027.02s)]
*  Well, I don't know if he locked down. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2033.02s)]
*  I think it would be much more function of a society's private. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2034.04s)]
*  Then you just can't walk around wherever you want. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2037.04s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2040.04s)]
*  Meaning like public streets force you that literally anyone can do anything on the streets and you have to put up with their bullshit. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2041.04s)]
*  If that's if it's like a bar or if it's like Costco, you got to make sure you pass a certain criteria to be able to even step foot in here. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2048.04s)]
*  So exile would be a very good way. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2055.04s)]
*  So what would New York City look like in an anarchist ideal anarchist system? [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2056.04s)]
*  It would be a crater. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2061.06s)]
*  No, no, no. Break it down. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2064.06s)]
*  So like like New York, the thing is like I can't answer that question, but I'll answer in a way that you'll be happy with my non answer. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2065.06s)]
*  After communism fell in Eastern Europe, right? [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2072.06s)]
*  Let's suppose the capital of let's say Budapest, Hungary, right? [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2075.06s)]
*  All the restaurants had been government controlled, right? [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2079.06s)]
*  Then the free market came in. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2082.06s)]
*  If I asked you how many restaurants agree in Budapest, what cuisines, you would have no idea. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2083.06s)]
*  And neither would I. We don't know. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2088.06s)]
*  We know there would be restaurants and we diverse and maybe they'd be some Russian ones. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2089.08s)]
*  Maybe they'd be Chinese ones like you like, whatever. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2092.08s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2094.08s)]
*  The point is you can't if you could plan what people would decide to do, it would be a lot simpler, but we can't predict that. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2095.08s)]
*  You know, it's like it's like when you have sci fi and people go to other planets and it's like snake people and all their buildings look like scales and tails. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2102.08s)]
*  It's like we don't have buildings that look like hands and feet. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2109.08s)]
*  We don't know what that would look like in a society built by snake people because we haven't run the experiment. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2112.08s)]
*  So we don't know what in New York would look like were as far less regulated. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2116.1s)]
*  Yeah, that's my only use the term wrap your mind around. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2119.1s)]
*  That's my only struggle with this idea of anarchy is I can't wrap my mind around what it would look like. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2122.1s)]
*  And that is terrifying to me because it's so unknown and the anarchy could lead to. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2127.1s)]
*  And we can't wrap our. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2132.1s)]
*  But the thing is, you're concerned. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2135.1s)]
*  You're every what are presented as the strongest arguments about anarchy. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2137.1s)]
*  The strongest arguments about anarchism are inevitably descriptions of the status quo. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2141.12s)]
*  So the concern is that it might lead to anarchy where people are burning streets like cop stations down and burning down the street and no repercussions to them. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2145.12s)]
*  We saw that that happens now. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2153.12s)]
*  Yeah, so for me, it's not about what it looks like. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2155.12s)]
*  It's it's what it looks like privatized because I think that was the solution that you put forth. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2158.12s)]
*  So is Times Square essentially privatized? [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2163.12s)]
*  Yeah, and then sure. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2166.12s)]
*  Entrance to Times Square is decided by whoever owns Times Square. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2167.14s)]
*  Or it could be just like a Disneyland. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2171.14s)]
*  It could be the default as anyone can go. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2173.14s)]
*  But, you know, like a lot of these stores, you know, once you get arrested, you're trespassed. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2175.14s)]
*  You can't go to Walmart. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2180.14s)]
*  You break it once you're not going back. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2181.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2182.14s)]
*  Interesting. So it could be twice or it could be three times. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2183.14s)]
*  You know, whatever that group that lives in time. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2185.14s)]
*  OK, OK. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2188.14s)]
*  It's just it's these are one of those things where it's like you thought out these thought experiments and the average person has not considered it at all. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2189.14s)]
*  So I'm just trying to like build. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2196.16s)]
*  But I'll just give a very easy metaphor. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2197.16s)]
*  The places where we are least safe, all of us, are the places that are under government control. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2200.16s)]
*  The subways, alleys, public parks, whereas places like hotels where everyone is doesn't even live there. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2206.16s)]
*  Bars full of young drunken men full of alcohol are still safer than these places where the government has control over security. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2214.16s)]
*  Can you give us an example of a place that is frequented by as many people that is private that is not as dangerous as the subway? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2222.18s)]
*  Because I think that that's also just. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2232.18s)]
*  Yeah, there you go. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2234.18s)]
*  Burning Man. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2235.18s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2236.18s)]
*  Burning Man is amazing. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2237.18s)]
*  But it's still not even close to as many people as a subway. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2238.18s)]
*  I guess what I'm saying is these Walmart, these public places that you're mentioning are frequented by millions of people, whereas the private ones are mentioned. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2240.18s)]
*  McDonald's. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2249.18s)]
*  Hold on, hold on, hold on. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2250.2s)]
*  If McDonald's was allowed to have private security. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2253.2s)]
*  If you had, if restaurants were allowed to have bouncers who could actually do something, you wouldn't have any of this fucking craziness. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2258.2s)]
*  How about malls? [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2264.2s)]
*  Because malls have security and I think there's been shootings at malls and movie theaters. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2265.2s)]
*  What's the argument for them not having private security? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2269.2s)]
*  Because the government has a monopoly. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2272.2s)]
*  But what is the steel man for them in that situation? [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2274.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2276.2s)]
*  I don't have a good steel man on this one. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2278.22s)]
*  Maybe I'm full of shit, but I don't even know the argument about how, why it's not allowed. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2280.22s)]
*  Because bars have them? [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2284.22s)]
*  But they don't have security in the sense of arrest powers. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2285.22s)]
*  They could just kick you out. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2288.22s)]
*  Got that. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2290.22s)]
*  All they can do is control entrance. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2291.22s)]
*  They can't really, which you can do. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2292.22s)]
*  I don't know what the argument, I'm sure there is a fairly decent one. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2294.22s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2297.22s)]
*  That's interesting because that seems like an absolute no brainer. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2298.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2300.22s)]
*  Because we have versions of this, right? [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2301.22s)]
*  You have a doorman for a building. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2302.22s)]
*  The doorman, yes. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2303.22s)]
*  Well, I know what it is. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2304.22s)]
*  I think it's that. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2305.22s)]
*  The level of security, it's like if you just hire anybody off the street to be a security [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2306.24s)]
*  guard and then that power goes to their head. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2309.62s)]
*  Now it's like, oh, I'm shooting somebody just because they. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2312.12s)]
*  Oh, if you're giving them the authority to shoot. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2314.64s)]
*  But that's just describing the cops. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2316.64s)]
*  Yeah, but at least they go through formal training and even that sometimes lets them [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2318.64s)]
*  down. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2322.9599999999996s)]
*  Imagine if you go through zero formal training and then you're given the right to control [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2323.9599999999996s)]
*  it. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2328.0s)]
*  I would imagine they would have this kind of licensing, right? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2329.0s)]
*  Some private licensing. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2330.0s)]
*  So then that's. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2331.0s)]
*  That would be some criteria. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2332.0s)]
*  Now that's somebody controlling that thing is body. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2333.02s)]
*  No, but it's like the body. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2336.18s)]
*  But there's like ex-military people, right? [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2338.18s)]
*  There's a lot of them who could be doing great jobs in their communities. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2340.38s)]
*  Also trained by the government. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2343.74s)]
*  Sure. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2344.74s)]
*  But the point is they have the capacity to provide security. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2345.74s)]
*  I mean, I learned if somebody learns how to read in like a government school, it's not [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2349.26s)]
*  like everything that they write as a novelist is going to be a function of the government. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2354.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2357.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2358.3s)]
*  OK, OK. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2359.3s)]
*  No, this does make sense. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2360.3s)]
*  We need more security. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2361.32s)]
*  And I think it's the government's job to keep us insecure. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2362.32s)]
*  And that's something as a Texan I've appreciated that a lot of people I walk around are packing [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2365.6800000000003s)]
*  and I feel a lot safer in Austin than I do here. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2369.8s)]
*  Really? [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2372.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2373.48s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2374.48s)]
*  Do you feel culturally like when you're in Texas. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2375.48s)]
*  You don't feel safer in Texas? [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2377.6000000000004s)]
*  No. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2378.6000000000004s)]
*  Really? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2379.6000000000004s)]
*  There are more mass shootings and I'm an actual Texan and there are more mass shootings in [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2380.6000000000004s)]
*  Texas than most states. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2383.96s)]
*  Yeah, but day to day. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2386.0800000000004s)]
*  I do not feel like the same way on the subway here as opposed to walking around there. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2388.18s)]
*  But you're not even seeing close to as many people. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2393.18s)]
*  I see big guns on people's hips like that scares me. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2395.66s)]
*  OK. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2397.62s)]
*  That's not something I want to see. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2398.62s)]
*  Like go to the park and just see AK-47. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2399.62s)]
*  Like there's a shopping center in Allen I used to go to a lot as a kid. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2402.02s)]
*  There was a mass shooting there a year ago and it's crazy. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2404.7s)]
*  My parents lived five minutes from there. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2407.3799999999997s)]
*  And now I went back after we had to go do something. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2410.2599999999998s)]
*  We just went to the area. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2412.42s)]
*  It's a fucking ghost town now. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2413.42s)]
*  There was a place where everybody's allowed to have guns. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2415.1s)]
*  There was a mass shooting. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2417.68s)]
*  Now no one goes there. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2418.68s)]
*  All these businesses are suffering. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2419.68s)]
*  Even in kind of a you govern yourself type of place where it's like, you know, we all [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2421.04s)]
*  got guns open carry. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2424.7599999999998s)]
*  The idea is anybody pops off, there's going to be somebody here with a gun. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2426.7999999999997s)]
*  Something popped off. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2430.48s)]
*  Nobody was there. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2431.48s)]
*  And I'm not a super gun control guy. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2432.48s)]
*  So the subway station that was across from my house here in Brooklyn that I lived for [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2433.6s)]
*  like 17 years was the one that the guy shot up. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2439.04s)]
*  Like after I left and how you shoot up a subway station and not kill anyone. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2442.3599999999997s)]
*  Now you're a real fuck up. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2446.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2447.1s)]
*  Point being, I don't have a good answer for this. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2448.1s)]
*  And anyone who says they have an easy answer is full of it. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2451.1s)]
*  We have mass shootings in areas like that. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2453.42s)]
*  We have mass shootings in areas here where there is the strictest gun control. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2455.42s)]
*  And I don't have a good answer. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2459.06s)]
*  I don't think anyone does. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2460.54s)]
*  Your argument is I'd rather the freedom if it's going to happen in both places. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2461.7400000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2465.3s)]
*  Which I think is reasonable. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2466.3s)]
*  If we found out that it happened the same amount, if we found out that it happened way [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2468.02s)]
*  more on one side, let's say it happened way more here. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2472.02s)]
*  If we go, hey, we're doing something wrong, maybe we should let some people have guns. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2474.96s)]
*  I don't think people would. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2476.96s)]
*  I think people just double down. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2477.96s)]
*  Of course. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2478.96s)]
*  I'm not saying what they think is rational. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2479.96s)]
*  I'm just saying we could look at some data and then we could adjust it accordingly. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2480.96s)]
*  Yeah, this is interesting. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2484.58s)]
*  Okay, okay, okay. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2485.98s)]
*  I kind of want to learn more about this. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2486.98s)]
*  What are other, where do you come up with this? [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2488.98s)]
*  Like where do you come up with this, your ideas? [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2491.14s)]
*  Yeah, no, no, no. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2493.14s)]
*  I'm trying to like, how does this enter your brain? [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2494.14s)]
*  Like you're a kid who grows up in Brooklyn. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2495.86s)]
*  Sure. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2497.38s)]
*  There's no reason why you should hate bureaucracy if you're going through what everyone else [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2498.38s)]
*  is going through in the city. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2502.82s)]
*  Is it your ties to Russia and your parents being from there? [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2504.2799999999997s)]
*  No, it's from the side. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2506.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2507.6s)]
*  This is what Israel tells you. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2508.6s)]
*  No, I mean, it's like your parents leaving a place with tons of governing, government [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2509.6s)]
*  authority and then seeing how that went. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2513.4s)]
*  No, but I think there's plenty of Russians who left the Soviet Union who don't think [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2515.6s)]
*  like I do, so that's not really- [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2518.4s)]
*  Are you familiar with Cubans in America? [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2519.4s)]
*  Oh, of course, yes. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2521.04s)]
*  Okay, so Cubans, they're awesome, right? [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2522.04s)]
*  And they have this, obviously, they hear the tales of what happened in their country and [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2524.0s)]
*  because of that, they're usually very conservative, right? [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2527.8399999999997s)]
*  Is there anything even close to socialism, nexus, communism? [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2530.52s)]
*  Them were fucked, I remember exactly. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2533.7s)]
*  One of the greatest moments of my life was being able to tell my Cuban friend that Castro [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2535.14s)]
*  died. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2538.46s)]
*  It was a great day. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2539.46s)]
*  I'm like, dude, he's dead. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2540.46s)]
*  He's like, what? [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2541.46s)]
*  He didn't even know? [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2542.46s)]
*  He didn't know. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2543.46s)]
*  I was the first to- [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2544.46s)]
*  You gotta get on his WhatsApp, yeah? [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2545.46s)]
*  Okay, so is this the same for you or it enters you in a completely different way? [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2546.46s)]
*  It's a very boomer thing that this idea that socialism leads to communism. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2552.86s)]
*  That's only happened in Venezuela. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2556.98s)]
*  That's never happened anywhere else. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2558.72s)]
*  And communism always comes about as a result of revolution. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2560.48s)]
*  And it's kind of this Greta Thunberg hockey stick, like eventually socialism becomes communism. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2563.4199999999996s)]
*  That's never actually happened. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2568.04s)]
*  There's no examples of this. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2569.3199999999997s)]
*  It's always a revolution. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2570.3199999999997s)]
*  So that's not a big concern of mine. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2571.52s)]
*  But my big concern is a totalitarian mindset that is spread very consciously throughout [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2575.14s)]
*  the population. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2582.06s)]
*  And we saw it pretty much on COVID, where one of the things I learned when I was riding [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2583.52s)]
*  the White Hill is when you had these secret police in these countries, I would have thought, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2587.54s)]
*  okay, Andrew's arrested. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2591.98s)]
*  He's being held at gunpoint. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2594.3s)]
*  They're like, name names. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2595.88s)]
*  He's like, Malice. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2596.88s)]
*  He's like, I gotta name a name or else they're gonna kill me and my family. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2597.88s)]
*  It's not even hard. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2600.42s)]
*  I don't even blame you. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2601.42s)]
*  What I learned is people are tripping over themselves to snitch. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2602.42s)]
*  They couldn't wait. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2605.74s)]
*  They couldn't wait. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2606.74s)]
*  They weren't given a lot of money. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2607.74s)]
*  They wanted someone to, they wanted to feel important. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2608.74s)]
*  This surprised you about humanity though? [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2611.02s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2612.66s)]
*  And they wanted to feel heard. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2613.66s)]
*  Then when COVID happened, we saw it. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2615.88s)]
*  It's power. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2617.7200000000003s)]
*  People were bragging, oh, I got this person fired or kicked out of the store. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2618.7200000000003s)]
*  Put him on fucking social media. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2623.52s)]
*  They were ecstatic. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2625.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2626.04s)]
*  I think it's a couple of things. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2627.04s)]
*  I think they want to feel important. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2628.76s)]
*  They want to feel heard. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2629.76s)]
*  But I also think it's you've given power to a group of people that have had none. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2630.76s)]
*  And a lot of power. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2634.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2636.6800000000003s)]
*  Fire someone. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2637.6800000000003s)]
*  They finally feel important. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2638.6800000000003s)]
*  Cancel someone. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2639.6800000000003s)]
*  Destroy somebody. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2640.6800000000003s)]
*  That is intoxicating. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2641.6800000000003s)]
*  Especially for white women. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2642.6800000000003s)]
*  It's tied to an ideology of morality. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2644.02s)]
*  Yeah, you get to be a hero while you fire these people. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2647.02s)]
*  It's not just data. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2650.02s)]
*  It's like if you do this, you're a good person. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2651.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2653.02s)]
*  So they weaponized morality. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2654.02s)]
*  But I would say that this is just human instinct. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2657.02s)]
*  And they found a way to put the carrot in front of them. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2659.02s)]
*  And then they gave them the sticks. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2662.02s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2665.02s)]
*  We'll do it all. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2667.02s)]
*  You don't even need, like human beings will do everything. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2668.02s)]
*  It's not like you need to make all these things. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2671.02s)]
*  You need to make all these phone calls and have this like, people think that the CIA [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2673.36s)]
*  is tapped into every single school and every single country and there are all these computers [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2677.36s)]
*  and everything is no, no, no, you just need to put the carrot in front of them and we [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2681.8s)]
*  will walk towards that fucking carrot. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2685.7599999999998s)]
*  No dictatorship ever had like a huge percentage of the population as the police. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2687.36s)]
*  You can't afford it. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2691.7599999999998s)]
*  It's always going to be a small number than everyone else picks up the slack. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2693.5s)]
*  So even the Soviet Union where the idea is that everybody was listening on every phone [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2696.64s)]
*  call, it wasn't that way at all? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2700.4s)]
*  They were listening in. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2702.78s)]
*  But the point is, if this was the Soviet Union, one of us would be KGB. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2703.78s)]
*  Like they would, they would flip one of us. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2708.78s)]
*  And once you got one. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2710.78s)]
*  Yeah, or you're set. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2712.78s)]
*  Or what they would do in East Germany, the Stasi, they would put someone in here, some [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2713.78s)]
*  of that person be like, we should overthrow the government. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2717.78s)]
*  The rest of us were like, dude, you're crazy. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2719.78s)]
*  But then we're all arrested because we had someone in our group saying we should overthrow [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2721.78s)]
*  the government. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2724.78s)]
*  So it was intentional setups. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2726.78s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2727.78s)]
*  I talk about this a lot in the book. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2728.78s)]
*  All these tactics they use, they're very, very clever. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2731.1600000000003s)]
*  So were you not as cozy to anarchist ideals before COVID? [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2733.1600000000003s)]
*  No, I mean, the anarchist handbook came out before COVID. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2738.1600000000003s)]
*  COVID just demonstrated to what extent the hunk inside every slave beats the heart of [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=2741.1600000000003s)]

*  That's a lot of stress. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3132.56s)]
*  77. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3133.56s)]
*  77. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3134.56s)]
*  And what the stuff that they're putting him through and if Tish James starts taking his [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3135.56s)]
*  house, like, I don't know. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3138.28s)]
*  How do you feel about Trump? [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3141.08s)]
*  I know you're not necessarily saying can you can you expand on why? [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3142.08s)]
*  It's really kind of funny. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3145.2s)]
*  So if you what do you call someone who thinks Trump is dumb, doesn't have the temperament [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3146.2s)]
*  president and kind of sucked as when he was in the Oval Office? [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3151.7599999999998s)]
*  A Trump supporter. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3155.68s)]
*  Because unless you think he's the worst thing to ever happen to America, you're a Trump [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3158.68s)]
*  supporter. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3162.08s)]
*  Those are the two choices. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3163.08s)]
*  And if you criticize him in any way, you have TDS. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3164.08s)]
*  Like this is the fucking retarded binary. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3166.3599999999997s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3168.16s)]
*  This is this kind of binary we have where you either have TDS or you're a Trump supporter. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3169.16s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3173.56s)]
*  Trump's arrangement syndrome. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3174.56s)]
*  Like where it's just like, oh my God, I hate everything. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3175.56s)]
*  I'm going to wear a pussy on my head and show him. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3178.76s)]
*  Like, OK, yeah. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3181.2000000000003s)]
*  I think he's done a great, great job at radicalizing people. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3183.32s)]
*  I think he's done a great job at exposing the evil of the corporate press. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3187.8s)]
*  That was one of his greatest accomplishments. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3191.88s)]
*  But if people think that Trump's going to save them, like they're they're they're crazy. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3195.26s)]
*  And I don't think he's. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3200.6800000000003s)]
*  Do you think he's well-intentioned? [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3201.6800000000003s)]
*  No. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3203.44s)]
*  Who thinks he's well-intentioned? [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3204.44s)]
*  I just want to hear. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3205.44s)]
*  I mean, I think he loves America, but like he's looking out for number one, more power [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3206.44s)]
*  to him. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3209.68s)]
*  But we saw who he staffed. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3210.9199999999996s)]
*  Like this, like this idea that Trump at age, what was it? [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3213.48s)]
*  Seventy eight? [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3216.44s)]
*  Seventy seven is like learning from his mistakes. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3217.44s)]
*  The fuck? [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3219.64s)]
*  At what point do you stop getting do overs? [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3220.64s)]
*  Like no one made him hire John Bolton. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3223.08s)]
*  He hired Omarosa. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3225.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3226.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3227.08s)]
*  Like, OK, like what the like explain. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3228.08s)]
*  This woman on his own show, her whole shtick was like being a snake. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3229.92s)]
*  Why did you hire Omarosa? [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3235.5200000000004s)]
*  Who is her? [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3236.5200000000004s)]
*  It's not like she's strong in the black community. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3237.5200000000004s)]
*  It's like it was like little Kim or like Missy. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3240.5200000000004s)]
*  It's like, OK, I get it. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3242.5600000000004s)]
*  Like you're making outreach to people that people like. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3243.76s)]
*  Fucking Omarosa. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3246.28s)]
*  You're the only one that liked her. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3247.28s)]
*  You're the only one that liked her. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3249.5200000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3251.5200000000004s)]
*  So it's just like these. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3252.5200000000004s)]
*  And the thing is, your entire name was spent on 12 years firing and hiring the right people. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3253.6s)]
*  So how are you fucking hiring and firing John Bolton? [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3261.4s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3263.68s)]
*  So I'm but let's the other side. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3265.64s)]
*  It could be that at this point, like who wants to work for this guy? [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3269.44s)]
*  Because as soon as I leave, he calls on Twitter and calls me a fucking idiot. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3272.88s)]
*  So there's nobody willing to step up except for the crazies. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3276.6s)]
*  So you're left with the crazy. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3279.16s)]
*  But the crazies are the ones who get things done because the crazies don't give a fuck. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3281.36s)]
*  Can you explain why John Bolton was such a peculiar hire? [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3285.28s)]
*  We used to see Bolton at Fox all the time. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3288.06s)]
*  There's a picture of me sitting next to him giving the death glare. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3290.04s)]
*  OK, so explain Bolton. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3292.7200000000003s)]
*  The average. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3295.2400000000002s)]
*  OK, I'm getting triggered because one. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3296.2400000000002s)]
*  No, no. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3299.1200000000003s)]
*  Here's why. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3300.1200000000003s)]
*  I'll tell you why. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3301.1200000000003s)]
*  Because one of my books is about North Korea. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3302.1200000000003s)]
*  I'm like a North Korea guy. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3303.1200000000003s)]
*  And before he was hired in the Trump administration, he had an editorial in The Wall Street Journal, [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3304.1200000000003s)]
*  where he's like, if shit hit the fan between North Korea and South Korea, like America [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3310.44s)]
*  has the right to fucking bomb the fuck out of North Korea without even bothering to tell [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3315.64s)]
*  South Korea. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3319.32s)]
*  And he knows and he says in an article, there's nukes pointing from North Korea to Seoul. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3320.32s)]
*  Seoul is like 20 miles south of where some short distance. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3325.88s)]
*  You're willing to play roulette and kill in a minute millions of people. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3329.08s)]
*  And you're putting this in writing in the fucking Wall Street Journal. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3334.2400000000002s)]
*  So he never met a war he didn't like. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3337.16s)]
*  He just wants to bomb the hell out of everything. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3340.8399999999997s)]
*  I think that's the kind of thing that's got to be. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3343.24s)]
*  And he was Trump's secretary of state? [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3345.52s)]
*  No, he was a national security adviser. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3347.3199999999997s)]
*  It was secretary of state. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3351.16s)]
*  And he fired him or he left whatever. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3353.6s)]
*  And of course, John Bolton turned on him. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3355.7599999999998s)]
*  But it's just like, what the fuck do you expect? [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3357.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3359.44s)]
*  So the idea was that he's going to go out there and clean the swamp and he's going to [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3360.44s)]
*  take outsiders, etc. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3363.7999999999997s)]
*  And John Bolton is a pretty well known political insider. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3365.36s)]
*  How are you going to clean the swamp? [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3368.88s)]
*  And your secretary of state is the guy who run Exxon? [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3371.04s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about? [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3374.44s)]
*  Well, I guess the argument is like with that is you're taking guys from the private sector [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3375.44s)]
*  and putting them in these positions. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3379.76s)]
*  But Exxon, come on. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3380.76s)]
*  But Exxon is obviously lobbying government. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3381.76s)]
*  They're gigantic. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3383.56s)]
*  They have a bigger budget than most countries. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3384.56s)]
*  Government organizations here. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3387.96s)]
*  I think that's the other thing that Americans are now a little bit more aware of. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3389.6000000000004s)]
*  And maybe put him in the sector of commerce. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3392.1200000000003s)]
*  He was secretary of state, which is diplomacy. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3393.76s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about? [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3395.76s)]
*  And did he shrink government at all during his four years? [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3396.76s)]
*  No, he didn't even try it. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3398.76s)]
*  He didn't even try. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3399.96s)]
*  Why do they think they're going to do it again? [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3400.96s)]
*  So if these things don't matter to people, right? [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3402.96s)]
*  If the data or the facts don't matter to people. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3405.16s)]
*  One, why is that? [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3408.0s)]
*  Because people are interested in narratives, not the truth. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3409.64s)]
*  And what is the narrative on Trump? [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3412.12s)]
*  Preach. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3414.16s)]
*  That they're seduced by. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3415.56s)]
*  Which who? The Trump supporters? [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3417.8s)]
*  I'm sure there's different factions, but sure. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3419.32s)]
*  I think one of the big narratives is, and they're not wrong, is he's the only candidate [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3421.7999999999997s)]
*  out there who cares about us who have been ignored for a long time. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3426.56s)]
*  Which is valid. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3430.3599999999997s)]
*  That's valid. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3431.3599999999997s)]
*  That's perfectly true. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3432.3599999999997s)]
*  I think that's true. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3433.3599999999997s)]
*  And if he does care about us, they can look past these other shortcomings. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3434.3599999999997s)]
*  Before they see what's the alternative. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3438.24s)]
*  I'd rather have someone who cares about me than someone who doesn't, right? [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3440.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's a lesser of two situations, like what we were saying before. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3442.56s)]
*  So yeah, he might hire Bolton and he might put the Exxon guy in there for foreign affairs [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3445.48s)]
*  and that might help out all the oil companies and yada yada. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3449.64s)]
*  But he's going to actually do something for us. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3453.36s)]
*  No, I think people underestimate how for decades, the only thing conservatism care about is [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3455.7599999999998s)]
*  getting leftists upset. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3461.6s)]
*  And they consider that a win. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3463.48s)]
*  It's like, OK, I'm going to sterilize your kids. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3464.72s)]
*  You get to call me a moron. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3466.96s)]
*  Which one of us is winning? [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3468.12s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3469.12s)]
*  So the fact that he got people so upset is like, oh, I'm winning. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3470.12s)]
*  It's like, what's this happening? [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3473.44s)]
*  But you're not getting any wins, just getting people upset. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3474.44s)]
*  Where's the policy change? [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3477.2799999999997s)]
*  We're speaking to what people really want. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3478.32s)]
*  Like sometimes people don't want change. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3479.7200000000003s)]
*  They just want to dunk on you. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3481.2400000000002s)]
*  Yes, that's it. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3482.48s)]
*  Trump's the dunker. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3483.48s)]
*  And he's going to come in and he's going to do it. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3484.48s)]
*  He really is. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3486.76s)]
*  He's on the free throw line. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3487.76s)]
*  Is that a rapper? [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3488.76s)]
*  Close, he's a basketball player. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3489.76s)]
*  That's what I said. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3494.76s)]
*  Is that a euphemism, basketball player? [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3497.28s)]
*  But no, that's a great point. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3500.84s)]
*  Can I say one thing? [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3502.96s)]
*  I got to say one thing. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3503.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3504.96s)]
*  I was on the flight coming here. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3505.96s)]
*  I was asleep. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3507.0800000000004s)]
*  I was taking a right-eye-sick sleep. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3508.88s)]
*  The guy behind me wakes me up screaming, someone please help me. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3509.88s)]
*  He has his hands around the person next to his neck and I turn around and hand to God, [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3515.36s)]
*  I've been spending so much time watching airplane freakouts that I wasn't even scared. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3520.4s)]
*  I'm like, oh, cool. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3525.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm like, I'm having a story. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3526.7599999999998s)]
*  The first thought was, should I film this? [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3529.7599999999998s)]
*  I was already sure. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3532.2799999999997s)]
*  My first thought was, should I film this? [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3533.2799999999997s)]
*  I swear to God, my second thought was, should I yell out, world star? [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3535.4s)]
*  He's supposed to film that. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3540.08s)]
*  He's working on it. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3545.08s)]
*  It's a long story short, the guy's wife, mom, excuse me, was having a seizure. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3549.2400000000002s)]
*  She couldn't breathe. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3555.92s)]
*  I've never seen someone having a seizure in person. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3556.92s)]
*  There was no one there. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3559.4s)]
*  It was like a statue. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3560.7200000000003s)]
*  It was very, very scary. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3561.7200000000003s)]
*  So the hands around the neck were for? [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3563.4s)]
*  I think he was trying to shake her. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3564.52s)]
*  But is someone a doctor for the love of Jesus? [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3567.56s)]
*  He called that for Jesus and Jesus answered. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3569.6s)]
*  She's fine, I think. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3571.12s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3572.12s)]
*  That's my show. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3573.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3574.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3575.12s)]
*  Anyway, back to what people want from Trump. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3576.12s)]
*  I think that's a really great observation. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3577.12s)]
*  It's sometimes they want, they say they want all this change, but in reality, they just [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3579.0s)]
*  want revenge. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3584.4s)]
*  They feel like they've been dunked on for so long by media, different pundits, late [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3585.4s)]
*  night shows, and all of a sudden this guy comes out and he's shooting. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3589.24s)]
*  He's taken down everybody and he's the best at it. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3591.96s)]
*  So it's, yeah, you feel this sense of, I guess, it's victory, freedom, revenge. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3594.88s)]
*  But the thing is, if you're going to- [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3600.8s)]
*  Biden's the guy who comes in for garbage minutes and passes it up. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3601.8s)]
*  For real. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3605.36s)]
*  The problem with Trump is if you're going to storm their forts, you got to rape their [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3606.36s)]
*  women and kill their kids. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3610.36s)]
*  You don't just storm the fort and be like, you're a loser. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3611.48s)]
*  Okay, bye. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3613.7200000000003s)]
*  Like, what's the point? [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3614.7200000000003s)]
*  Maybe that was enough. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3615.7200000000003s)]
*  It wasn't enough. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3616.7200000000003s)]
*  Look where we are. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3617.7200000000003s)]
*  For what the people want. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3618.7200000000003s)]
*  It was enough for them. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3619.7200000000003s)]
*  It was their pound of flesh. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3620.7200000000003s)]
*  It wasn't even a pound of flesh, it was a picture. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3622.48s)]
*  That's all they cared about. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3624.12s)]
*  But that's all they cared about. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3625.12s)]
*  And imagine being in a situation where that's all you need. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3626.12s)]
*  That's a pretty dire situation where you're not even like, all right, fuck change. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3629.12s)]
*  I don't even need change. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3631.7999999999997s)]
*  There's no way that that's actually going to happen. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3633.12s)]
*  Just tell them they're fat. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3634.8399999999997s)]
*  So that's a pretty- [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3637.3599999999997s)]
*  Do you feel the same way about storming the Capitol? [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3638.3599999999997s)]
*  That was a symbolic victory, that people felt like they did something, but it was completely [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3640.52s)]
*  trivial? [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3644.3199999999997s)]
*  I mean, this is another argument against Trump. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3645.3199999999997s)]
*  These were your people, and you fucking let them sit in solitary? [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3648.4s)]
*  Fuck you. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3651.92s)]
*  I mean, what kind of man are you? [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3652.92s)]
*  What do you think should happen to them? [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3653.92s)]
*  They should be elected. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3655.52s)]
*  You've got the perfect answer for everything. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3656.52s)]
*  It's not a real answer, but it's a perfect answer. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3661.52s)]
*  You got a little Trump in you. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3665.6800000000003s)]
*  Perfect answer. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3667.6800000000003s)]
*  You're fired. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3669.0s)]
*  I think that when these people who didn't bring weapons were put in solitary confinement [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3671.42s)]
*  for a long time, and he did nothing for them except later, he's bringing their mantle, [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3677.8399999999997s)]
*  I think it's just absolutely fucking outrageous that they weren't charged for months at a [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3682.7999999999997s)]
*  time, that the book thrown at them is just absolutely crazy. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3686.9599999999996s)]
*  And I think it's a good thing when politicians are afraid. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3690.9199999999996s)]
*  I think that's a very healthy thing for America, for any country. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3694.24s)]
*  So you think our politicians have gotten a little too comfortable? [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3698.9199999999996s)]
*  Gotten? [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3701.48s)]
*  I mean, they've been that way for decades. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3702.48s)]
*  They're on planes, they're fucking teenagers on islands. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3704.7599999999998s)]
*  One of the best things Trump did, and this is one of the great moments, maybe you guys [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3707.2799999999997s)]
*  could play the clip, was a bunch of congressmen were going to Afghanistan, I think, to a military [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3710.72s)]
*  base and Trump, as head of the executive branch, pulled their permission slip. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3715.8399999999997s)]
*  He goes, you can't use a federal plane. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3720.6s)]
*  And they had to circle the bus around and they drove him back and they had to get off [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3722.7599999999998s)]
*  the fucking bus. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3725.68s)]
*  And they didn't know what to do. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3726.68s)]
*  And why did he do that? [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3727.68s)]
*  What was the purpose? [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3728.68s)]
*  Just to fuck with them. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3729.68s)]
*  Because Nancy Pelosi was like, you can't stay in the union while this shit's going on. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3730.68s)]
*  Well, then you can't get on a plane. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3734.7999999999997s)]
*  And they just, the bus ran around like half an hour. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3737.04s)]
*  Like, what do we do? [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3739.24s)]
*  And they all have to fucking get off the bus looking like assholes. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3740.24s)]
*  So here's a perfect example. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3741.7599999999998s)]
*  It was hilarious. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3742.7599999999998s)]
*  But who cares? [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3743.7599999999998s)]
*  But this is, you like it. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3744.7599999999998s)]
*  I like it. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3745.7599999999998s)]
*  You like to see them getting done though. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3746.7599999999998s)]
*  But I'm not a Trump voter. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3747.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm not saying you are, but it satisfied that little itch that you had, which is okay, check [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3748.7599999999998s)]
*  these fucking... [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3752.24s)]
*  That itch should be satisfied and I can't finish this. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3753.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I think. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3755.24s)]
*  But I hear what you're saying. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3756.24s)]
*  Okay, okay, okay. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3757.24s)]
*  And then now what do you think that, what do you think people on the left are feeling [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3758.24s)]
*  now or want now? [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3762.2s)]
*  I don't think the left is like a monolith. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3764.52s)]
*  I really don't like that characterization because I think there's a lot of, like, for [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3765.96s)]
*  example, I have a lot of friends who are lefties, like 2016, they hated Hillary. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3769.7999999999997s)]
*  Okay, let me, let me change the question. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3774.6s)]
*  The people that maybe voted for Biden last election. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3777.16s)]
*  The corpses. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3782.04s)]
*  Yeah, like the corpses or the people were like, I can't vote for this fucking Trump. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3783.04s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3787.2799999999997s)]
*  But they're not these purple haired lesbians. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3788.2799999999997s)]
*  Absolutely, there's lots of them. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3790.92s)]
*  Okay, what are they thinking now? [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3792.24s)]
*  What do they, what do they need now? [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3794.9199999999996s)]
*  Do they feel satisfied? [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3796.3199999999997s)]
*  Do you think that they're embarrassed? [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3797.3199999999997s)]
*  I think it's, I think it's a mix. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3799.3199999999997s)]
*  I think a lot of people aren't going to vote for someone who's got a mugshot. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3801.12s)]
*  I think a lot of people don't pay attention to politics. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3805.68s)]
*  They see a mugshot, they're like, all right, I can't do this. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3807.6s)]
*  So maybe they won't vote for Biden. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3809.8799999999997s)]
*  Maybe they'll sit at home. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3810.8799999999997s)]
*  That's a big issue. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3812.2s)]
*  So they sit it out. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3813.2s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of people, it's the supermarket. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3814.2s)]
*  And that's the power of the mugshot. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3816.2s)]
*  It is. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3817.2s)]
*  You fucking bring him in, get his picture taken, and that's enough for some people. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3818.2s)]
*  Yeah, and I don't blame him. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3822.76s)]
*  Like if I'm not paying attention to politics, I know a guy's got all these charges. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3823.76s)]
*  I'm like, fuck it. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3825.76s)]
*  I can't bring myself to vote for him. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3826.76s)]
*  Maybe this other guy sucks, but I can't do it. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3828.0s)]
*  So I can understand that. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3829.64s)]
*  Supermarkets a big thing. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3831.12s)]
*  The prices. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3832.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's just like a right. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3833.12s)]
*  Like this is a problem. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3834.56s)]
*  It was easier before. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3835.56s)]
*  So that's a big, those people are going to vote for Trump. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3836.56s)]
*  I don't think we're going to know what the, what I think, here's the thing. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3838.8s)]
*  And this is not a particularly bold thing for me to say. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3842.32s)]
*  I think shit's going to get crazy in a way we haven't seen before. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3845.24s)]
*  Because if he's where he is in the polls now, Trump, where he's leading, which he never [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3849.86s)]
*  led at all in any poll in 2020, it was like one poll. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3853.34s)]
*  He's leading in a lot of the polls. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3856.42s)]
*  Things are going to get nuts. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3858.3s)]
*  And one of the predictions I had is if they pull Biden, their plan B is going to be Hillary. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3859.3s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3865.54s)]
*  And she would probably win. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3866.94s)]
*  Really? [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3868.42s)]
*  Hold on, hold on. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3869.42s)]
*  She got millions more votes the last time. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3870.42s)]
*  Now that doesn't count in terms of electoral college. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3872.6600000000003s)]
*  But if I'm starting out with a faster time than you, you know what I mean? [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3874.56s)]
*  And I just got to switch a few thousand, a few states. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3878.08s)]
*  That's a really strong opening position. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3881.0s)]
*  She doesn't have to defend Biden. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3882.7999999999997s)]
*  She gets Newsom as VP. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3884.22s)]
*  So he gets the suburban white woman vote. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3885.68s)]
*  She would go on that debate stage, go, eight years ago, you said I'd be in jail. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3888.46s)]
*  You're the one with the mugshot. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3892.16s)]
*  Right? [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3893.16s)]
*  And you, even you laughed. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3894.16s)]
*  See? [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3895.16s)]
*  It's funny. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3896.16s)]
*  I just find herself wholly unlikable. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3897.16s)]
*  And I didn't, I don't know one thing or another about Trump. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3900.64s)]
*  I just thought 2016 to 2020, there was so much fucking debate and everything was such [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3903.12s)]
*  a thing. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3907.16s)]
*  I kind of enjoy the relative piece, even though I don't think Biden's a good president. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3908.16s)]
*  Hillary out though, I just find so Biden, corpse or not, relatively sweet old guy he [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3911.7999999999997s)]
*  seems. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3917.08s)]
*  So as an unformed guy who doesn't even really vote, to be honest with you, I would be, if [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3918.08s)]
*  I had to vote, I'd be like, all right, I guess just give me the fucking quiet corpse as opposed [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3922.14s)]
*  to the guy who's going to rile everyone up. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3925.72s)]
*  But Hillary, I don't, I'm not voting. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3927.2999999999997s)]
*  Can they even swap somebody in at this time? [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3929.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, if he dies, he's incapacitated, but he could just, they could just sit him down. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3931.7999999999997s)]
*  Mentally unfit. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3937.4s)]
*  In 2020, to have your name on the ballot. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3938.4s)]
*  I can explain what happened in 2020. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3941.4s)]
*  In other words, just shut up. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3944.4s)]
*  I'm not saying that. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3947.4s)]
*  I'm just implying it. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3948.4s)]
*  In 2020, there was something called Super Tuesday, which is a bunch of primaries in [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3953.4s)]
*  the same day. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3957.4s)]
*  And Klobuchar and Buttigieg got the phone call because Bernie Sanders was leading in [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3958.4s)]
*  every state. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3961.84s)]
*  They go, it's Biden. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3962.84s)]
*  They just quit. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3963.84s)]
*  They're like, you're supposed to trust Biden. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3964.92s)]
*  And Biden swept it the next day. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3965.92s)]
*  So I'm sure someone give Biden the call being like, dude, you're losing to Trump. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=3967.2400000000002s)]

*  Are there any people or who's the closest to someone who has ended up with power and [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4148.5599999999995s)]
*  maybe they seek that power but they are benevolent? [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4155.639999999999s)]
*  Oh, Gorbachev. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4160.04s)]
*  Wow. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4161.599999999999s)]
*  So, this was a big theme of my book, The White Pill, when I learned about it because all [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4162.599999999999s)]
*  these different countries in the Soviet E-Block were calling him. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4167.36s)]
*  They go, dude, shit's hitting the fan. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4172.24s)]
*  Send in the tanks or it's all going to hell. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4174.599999999999s)]
*  And he said, nope. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4176.599999999999s)]
*  And why? [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4177.84s)]
*  Because he's like, I'm not having the blood of all these people in my hands. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4178.84s)]
*  East Germany with the Berlin Wall where East Berlin was surrounded by concrete barricade [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4181.24s)]
*  and people were imprisoned. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4185.12s)]
*  They were having protests and they were saying, we need another Tiananmen Square here, like [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4187.88s)]
*  your favorite place. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4192.08s)]
*  And Gorbachev called the Russians in East Berlin and says, we're not using force under [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4193.6s)]
*  any circumstances. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4198.64s)]
*  Shit's going to play out on its own. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4199.64s)]
*  And he went to East Germany and said in front of Hunnaker, who was the dictator, he goes, [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4201.08s)]
*  you're not a man of, some people get lost in the past and some people move forward. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4205.6s)]
*  So he was an example. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4209.16s)]
*  And I'm not saying everything is, people have mousetraps in their head. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4210.8s)]
*  When you say someone is an example, like, oh, he's probably saying he's Jesus. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4213.72s)]
*  I'm not saying he's Jesus. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4216.48s)]
*  I'm not saying he was a king of any kind. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4217.48s)]
*  My point being, to me, it's true though. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4219.799999999999s)]
*  When people have power and don't take their hands off the gun, that to me is, there's [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4223.639999999999s)]
*  a great story that I learned in this book. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4228.799999999999s)]
*  So Reagan was taken down to the bunker and walked through a nuclear attack and he goes, [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4231.099999999999s)]
*  you're telling me that Russia's throwing nukes at us and I press these buttons. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4237.4s)]
*  I'm killing like millions of people in minutes. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4242.16s)]
*  They're like, yeah. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4244.12s)]
*  He's like, uh-huh. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4245.12s)]
*  And he's like, I'm fucking putting a stop to this shit. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4246.12s)]
*  Gorbachev was taken down to the bunker as well. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4248.84s)]
*  And he goes, I'm not pressing this button even in a simulation. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4251.12s)]
*  If we're getting nuked when you're nuked, I'm not fucking retaliating. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4254.4s)]
*  Neither knew this. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4257.0s)]
*  So in the 80s, they're playing poker with all these fucking nukes. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4258.0s)]
*  But both of them had committed internally, like, I'm not fucking fighting back. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4261.0s)]
*  I'm not going to read this story. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4264.76s)]
*  Where is this from? [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4267.24s)]
*  I mean, it came out like one was Reagan's aid. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4268.24s)]
*  The other Gorbachev said it, not publicly, but said it. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4270.599999999999s)]
*  He said it explicitly. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4273.04s)]
*  I mean, what a cool piece of history. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4274.04s)]
*  How do you de-mousetrap people? [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4276.96s)]
*  I want mousetraps. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4279.56s)]
*  Oh, you mean like, oh, you can't. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4280.56s)]
*  And how do we get mousetraps in there in the first place? [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4283.8s)]
*  And just so everybody knows what we're talking about, the mousetraps are the trigger words [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4287.44s)]
*  that immediately shift someone's thinking and make them- [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4292.28s)]
*  Stop their critical thinking. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4296.08s)]
*  Yeah, immune to logic. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4297.08s)]
*  So the second you say- [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4299.08s)]
*  Trump. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4300.08s)]
*  Trump. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4301.08s)]
*  They've got a bunch of speeches. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4302.08s)]
*  Ivermectin. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4305.12s)]
*  You know what the speeches are? [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4306.12s)]
*  We already know. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4308.12s)]
*  So how do you de-mousetrap people? [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4309.12s)]
*  Or why are people so prone to mousetraps? [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4312.04s)]
*  This is one of the reasons I'm not a Christian. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4316.84s)]
*  Don't you fucking start with me. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4319.44s)]
*  I don't think human beings are all fundamentally the same. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4321.2s)]
*  I think some people, there's no one there. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4325.08s)]
*  And I don't think you can make it that there's someone there. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4328.04s)]
*  Do you think, sorry, with the mousetrap people, there's no one there? [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4330.28s)]
*  For many of them, yes. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4333.16s)]
*  I think this is their analog for thought. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4334.24s)]
*  But if you take out the mousetraps, it's not like you can build a house in there. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4337.24s)]
*  I would think it's a coping mechanism for the fact that there's so much to think about, [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4340.24s)]
*  so much to care about, quote unquote. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4343.24s)]
*  So we're just looking for the exit ramp to borrow terminology. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4345.24s)]
*  So like humans in general, a lot of times- [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4349.24s)]
*  See, again, I'm not generalizing. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4352.24s)]
*  I'm sorry to interrupt you. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4353.24s)]
*  No, that's fair. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4354.24s)]
*  But I think there's a large swath of humanity that is like, there's a lot to digest, [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4355.24s)]
*  a lot to think about. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4359.24s)]
*  If you can give me anything that gives me an exit ramp to not having to care about this issue, [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4360.32s)]
*  because my brain goes, well, that's what they are, then I'm going to take it. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4365.32s)]
*  Because we are wired to not exert too much energy thinking. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4368.32s)]
*  So there's two things with that. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4371.32s)]
*  One option, one reaction to that could be, I don't know, man. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4373.32s)]
*  I just don't know. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4380.32s)]
*  There's a lot I don't know yet. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4381.32s)]
*  Right? [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4382.32s)]
*  The other reaction is, I need to say the thing that does not ostracize me from my in-group. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4383.4s)]
*  Here is the thing. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4391.4s)]
*  Now that reaction, there's a neediness in that reaction. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4393.4s)]
*  There's an insecurity in that reaction. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4396.4s)]
*  It's a rational one. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4398.4s)]
*  Pardon? [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4399.4s)]
*  It's rational. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4400.4s)]
*  It's rational in that the importance of the in-group for your survival is crucial. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4401.4s)]
*  This is baked into us primarily on that. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4405.4s)]
*  Yes, very much so. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4406.4s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4407.4s)]
*  But it is different than, man, I don't know. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4408.4s)]
*  I just don't know enough. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4411.4s)]
*  Do you hate Trump? [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4412.48s)]
*  I don't really know enough about it. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4413.48s)]
*  You're a Trump supporter. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4414.48s)]
*  You should be a Trump supporter, right? [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4415.48s)]
*  If you say I don't know, you're a Trump supporter. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4418.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4420.48s)]
*  According to those people. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4421.48s)]
*  Yes. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4422.48s)]
*  OK. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4423.48s)]
*  So then I guess what we have to figure out is, what is the difference between the I don't [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4424.48s)]
*  know enough people and the people who are hyper concerned about being part of the in-group? [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4427.48s)]
*  And you think it's just an emptiness? [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4433.48s)]
*  Do you think it's an IQ thing? [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4435.48s)]
*  I don't think they have souls. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4437.48s)]
*  Come on. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4440.48s)]
*  I'm serious. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4441.5599999999995s)]

*  No. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4449.5599999999995s)]
*  Really? [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4450.5599999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4451.5599999999995s)]
*  Are you being genuine? [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4452.5599999999995s)]

*  Why is that? [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4457.5599999999995s)]
*  OK, so I can kind of... [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4458.5599999999995s)]
*  Do you have a piece of paper? [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4460.5599999999995s)]

*  Of course I had a pen. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4470.64s)]
*  No other way to write shit. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4473.64s)]
*  I haven't written a book with a pen in 20 years. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4476.64s)]
*  Of course I have a pen. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4479.64s)]
*  I got fancy pens and I have nothing to do with them, so I got to carry them around. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4480.64s)]
*  OK, go, go, go. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4483.64s)]

*  Did you text him? [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4498.64s)]
*  OK, is it crazy to draw on like that right there? [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4499.72s)]
*  Because you're going to leave these for us anyway. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4502.72s)]
*  Oh, you want me to? [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4504.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'd love to. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4505.320000000001s)]
*  And I wanted to sign it. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4506.320000000001s)]
*  He just stole his book, dude. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4507.320000000001s)]
*  OK, let's do this. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4508.320000000001s)]
*  I mean, if you have to take them to your next thing, then... [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4509.320000000001s)]
*  No, there's no next thing. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4510.92s)]
*  OK. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4511.92s)]
*  Here comes the paper. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4514.92s)]
*  I got it, I got it. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4515.92s)]
*  No, no, we got it. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4516.92s)]
*  This is even better. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4517.92s)]
*  This book is worth... [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4518.92s)]
*  No soul's... [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4519.92s)]
*  Once I... [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4520.92s)]
*  You'll hear, once I say it, then you'll be like, OK. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4521.92s)]
*  OK, so can we... [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4525.92s)]
*  Where's the camera? [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4526.92s)]
*  We got it on his phone. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4527.92s)]
*  OK, I think we're OK. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4529.2s)]
*  We got it. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4530.2s)]
*  Thank you, Tonya. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4531.2s)]
*  So what's this a picture of? [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4533.2s)]
*  That is a... [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4536.2s)]
*  That's Michael Malus. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4537.2s)]
*  Michael Malus. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4538.2s)]
*  That's right. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4539.2s)]
*  So point to him here. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4540.2s)]
*  And not point to him in real life. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4541.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4542.2s)]
*  And what's this? [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4543.2s)]
*  That's Andrew Schultz. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4544.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4545.2s)]
*  So, and what's this? [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4546.2s)]
*  That's a house. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4547.2s)]
*  Point to the house. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4548.2s)]
*  Where else is the house in real life? [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4549.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4551.2s)]
*  So these are 2D representations of 3D beings, but this house only exists in 2D. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4552.2s)]
*  So I think a lot of people who exist in 3D don't exist in 4D where the souls are. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4558.48s)]
*  So we're talking about one more dimension. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4565.48s)]
*  Yes. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4567.48s)]
*  He's using this as an example. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4568.48s)]
*  It's like an allegory of the cave type situation. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4569.48s)]
*  Not really. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4571.48s)]
*  Some people are just shadows. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4572.48s)]
*  Yes. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4573.48s)]
*  But they're not actually the form that creates the shadows. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4574.48s)]
*  Yes. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4576.48s)]
*  Brilliant. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4577.48s)]
*  Yes. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4578.48s)]
*  You thought he wasn't gone now? [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4579.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4580.48s)]
*  I thought he met the people in the cave. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4581.48s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4582.48s)]
*  This is good. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4583.48s)]
*  Yes. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4584.48s)]
*  OK. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4585.48s)]
*  I understand. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4586.48s)]
*  Do you think most people are worthy of human consideration? [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4587.759999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4589.759999999999s)]
*  I mean, I'm not in favor. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4590.759999999999s)]
*  No one believes that buildings don't have souls, right? [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4593.759999999999s)]
*  So I'm not saying, if someone says a building doesn't have souls, oh, you're saying we should [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4596.599999999999s)]
*  break down every building? [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4599.5199999999995s)]
*  That makes no sense, right? [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4600.5199999999995s)]
*  No one believes buildings don't have souls. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4602.139999999999s)]
*  No one believes buildings have souls. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4604.599999999999s)]
*  He mispoke. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4605.599999999999s)]
*  Or trees. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4606.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, you think trees don't have souls? [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4607.599999999999s)]
*  Or you're saying burn down all the forest? [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4609.599999999999s)]
*  That's completely not sequinary. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4611.16s)]
*  Right. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4612.599999999999s)]
*  But you're not going to negotiate with a building. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4613.599999999999s)]
*  You're not going to have an argument with them. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4615.48s)]
*  You're not going to debate them. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4616.98s)]
*  And you're not going to care about that building. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4617.98s)]
*  And the differentiator. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4619.7s)]
*  We wouldn't let buildings vote. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4620.7s)]
*  I don't believe in voting. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4621.98s)]
*  That's fair. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4622.98s)]
*  Well, that's just, I believe voting for anybody. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4623.98s)]
*  So to clarify, sorry, the differentiator between the soul having people and not is critical [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4626.98s)]
*  thinking essentially and not having those. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4632.48s)]
*  I think this, I don't know what it looks like in there, but I think the more you go down [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4634.7s)]
*  these kind of rabbit holes and people without inner monologues, people who are incapable [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4639.66s)]
*  of any kind of steel manning, incapable of literally any empathy. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4644.78s)]
*  I'm really glad that you steel manned. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4649.18s)]
*  It's annoying when people come on with arguments and they're not willing to justify the opposition. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4651.38s)]
*  There's also nothing wrong with saying I don't know because I'd rather someone think I'm [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4655.58s)]
*  honest than think I'm smart. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4659.099999999999s)]
*  It also makes me. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4660.74s)]
*  Because I'd rather talk to someone who's honest than somebody smart. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4661.74s)]
*  Because then like, okay, I don't agree with you, but I know you can be my friend. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4664.7s)]
*  I can rely on you. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4667.54s)]
*  Also makes me. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4668.54s)]
*  I know you come from place of truth. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4669.54s)]
*  Who the hell are these smart people? [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4670.54s)]
*  When you're around yourself, as obviously you've demonstrated. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4671.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4674.9s)]
*  So, so, so, I don't know why I'm like this. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4675.9s)]
*  I don't know why I'm like this. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4680.9s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4683.9s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4684.9s)]
*  I love it. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4685.9s)]
*  Never going to compliment you again. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4686.9s)]
*  I was excited about this. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4687.9s)]
*  Okay, okay, okay. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4688.9s)]
*  So, so then the question is, if you can be benevolent, right? [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4689.9s)]
*  Let's say you're in this position of power. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4696.38s)]
*  I'm not saying that you would want this position of power, but if you could be as benevolent [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4697.74s)]
*  as possible to these people who are soulless, according to you, how would you help them [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4701.26s)]
*  understand what is and can you even know what's best for them? [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4709.74s)]
*  Maybe what's best for them is to just wrap themselves around an ideology. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4714.5s)]
*  And like Akash said, it's like way less intellectual heavy lifting. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4718.46s)]
*  They get to be part of the group. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4721.5s)]
*  And yes, maybe that is the best life for them. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4722.5s)]
*  Not only the best, it's also unavoidable. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4724.5s)]
*  I think to your point, we're taught in elementary school that it's really important for everyone [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4726.38s)]
*  to be an involved citizen and be informed on current events. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4732.9800000000005s)]
*  That makes that's ridiculous. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4737.06s)]
*  But then, so that's part of it. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4738.66s)]
*  Now you created a problem in the minds of literally everybody. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4741.0s)]
*  And then the corporate press comes in and they're like, here's an issue. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4744.42s)]
*  And here's how you should feel about it. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4748.06s)]
*  So right away, they give them a solution to the problem they've created. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4749.78s)]
*  And I'll give you a very easy example. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4753.18s)]
*  So when you have a play, at the beginning of the play, you have a cast of characters [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4754.9s)]
*  like Mercutio, Romeo's friend who's got whatever, a Lotharibabla, and you describe who they [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4761.299999999999s)]
*  are. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4766.86s)]
*  So if you're reading the play, you can go back to the beginning, who's this guy again? [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4767.86s)]
*  When the corporate press introduces a character into a story, they'll right away tell you [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4770.139999999999s)]
*  whether you should like this person or not. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4775.78s)]
*  So if we were describing Joe Rogan, we'd say an objective description, like Joe Rogan, [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4778.58s)]
*  popular podcast host, or Joe Rogan, king of the bro, something like that, right? [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4783.06s)]
*  They'll say Joe Rogan, comma, who has a history of trans jokes, comma, that's the most important [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4786.740000000001s)]
*  thing to define Joe fucking Rogan. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4796.46s)]
*  So any article, when they bring a character onto the stage, they immediately tell the [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4799.22s)]
*  reader how they should feel about either the person or the event. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4803.740000000001s)]
*  So they create the problem in school where like, I have to care about everything. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4807.660000000001s)]
*  No one has the capacity to learn about everything or to know about everything. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4811.78s)]
*  So when they write the article, like, here's the facts, but here's right away how you should [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4815.0199999999995s)]
*  feel about it. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4818.139999999999s)]
*  And right away, everyone reading this be like, I can pass because not only am I informed [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4819.7s)]
*  in terms of I know the facts, I also have an opinion about it now. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4823.7s)]
*  Have you, you're probably familiar with Jonathan Haidt. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4826.78s)]
*  Oh, I think he's the most profound thinker nowadays. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4829.139999999999s)]
*  You can't, once you read him, you can't go back. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4832.78s)]
*  It's really interesting. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4834.7s)]
*  This theory of like a logic and reason. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4835.7s)]
*  He's got a new book out. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4836.98s)]
*  Are you going to have him on? [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4837.98s)]
*  I think he'd be a really good guest. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4838.98s)]
*  You love him. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4840.259999999999s)]
*  I spoke to him at the, at the cellar. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4841.74s)]
*  He was doing Gnome, the guy who owns the cellar. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4842.74s)]
*  Yeah, he was doing his pod. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4844.820000000001s)]
*  Gnome is a great part. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4846.1s)]
*  You guys have great conversations. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4847.1s)]
*  We went head to head. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4848.1s)]
*  It was really fun. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4849.1s)]
*  Was it good? [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4850.1s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4851.1s)]
*  Not really. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4852.1s)]
*  Okay. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4853.1s)]
*  Damn. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4854.1s)]
*  Well, he's, he's a sharp guy. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4855.1s)]
*  He's in it. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4856.1s)]
*  But he is like a boomer con. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4857.1s)]
*  Maybe, but he's, he's, he's well read. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4858.1s)]
*  I like him. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4859.1s)]
*  I like them. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4860.1s)]
*  We're kind of talking past each other. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4861.1s)]
*  Anyway, but so, so Jonathan, Jonathan was talking about the, he had that original book, [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4862.1s)]
*  The Righteous Mind. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4867.38s)]
*  Yes. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4868.38s)]
*  Everyone reading this should read that book. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4869.38s)]
*  It's a fantastic book. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4870.5s)]
*  And even before my books. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4871.5s)]
*  And you could probably articulate this better, but then I can, but it was this idea of, of [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4872.5s)]
*  logic and reason and what is being used and what is it? [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4876.78s)]
*  It's an elephant with a rider and a rider. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4879.9800000000005s)]
*  Yes. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4882.7s)]
*  And an interesting component, I think that he's added to in the most recent book is the [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4883.7s)]
*  first emotional reaction that you have for something ends up becoming, I think the elephant. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4887.22s)]
*  So the idea is you basically use reason to come to your conclusion and logic to justify [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4894.5s)]
*  it afterwards. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4900.820000000001s)]
*  So wherever you feel about something initially is what you're going to try to retroactively [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4901.820000000001s)]
*  justify. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4906.14s)]
*  Just rationalize. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4907.14s)]
*  I'll give you two examples. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4908.14s)]
*  One that just happened to me. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4909.14s)]
*  Okay. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4910.14s)]
*  One, he, so he ran these tests and he'd be like, okay, here's a scenario, by the way, [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4911.14s)]
*  another good way to know if someone's worth talking, talking to you is you give them a [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4915.14s)]
*  hypothetical. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4917.900000000001s)]
*  They're like, this would never happen. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4918.900000000001s)]
*  It's like, okay, great. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4919.900000000001s)]
*  Like, so you don't like fun. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4920.900000000001s)]
*  Like Einstein figured out one of his experiments. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4922.900000000001s)]
*  He's like, what would happen if you're running at the speed of light and you turn on a flashlight? [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4926.3s)]
*  And you know, some people be like, you can't run the speed of light. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4929.7s)]
*  It's like, okay, great. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4931.7s)]
*  Great. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4932.7s)]
*  Great. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4933.7s)]
*  Great. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4934.7s)]
*  Einstein's an idiot here. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4935.7s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4936.7s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4937.7s)]
*  What would happen? [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4938.7s)]
*  Nothing would happen. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4939.7s)]
*  Well, that's what he's like, started to figure. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4940.7s)]
*  I was like, okay, what if you're running at the speed of light in a truck and like, [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4941.7s)]
*  how can you figure out this? [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4942.7s)]
*  That's you turn on that flashlight, the speed of light. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4943.7s)]
*  It's just a light hovering at the tip of the flashlight because you're moving at the same [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4944.7s)]
*  speed as the projection of the light. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4950.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4952.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4953.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4954.38s)]
*  This guy's pretty smart. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4955.38s)]
*  This guy, right? [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4956.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4957.38s)]
*  Height had these moral questions. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4959.06s)]
*  What if brother and a sister had sex once, they used the condom, they had a fun time, [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4961.06s)]
*  they never did it again. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4967.58s)]
*  Is that wrong? [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4968.9400000000005s)]
*  And a lot of people would say yes. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4969.9400000000005s)]
*  And he goes, why? [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4970.9400000000005s)]
*  And then people like, and they start spazzing out. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4971.9400000000005s)]
*  And sometimes they'd be like, what if they had like fucked up kids? [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4975.86s)]
*  Well, they had a condom. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4978.06s)]
*  But we know they didn't have fucked up kids. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4979.06s)]
*  We set up the scenario. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4980.82s)]
*  We know everything that happened because this didn't really happen, but they'll still try [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4981.900000000001s)]
*  to find rationalizations to make it work. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4985.02s)]
*  And this just happened to me. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4987.62s)]
*  I have six. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4988.9s)]
*  And she said we shouldn't have kids. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4989.9s)]
*  And I'm like, you're right. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4994.9s)]
*  You waited until she went through medical. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4995.9s)]
*  So I have six light bulbs in my bedroom. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=4998.0599999999995s)]
*  One of the light bulbs is out. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5001.74s)]
*  And part of me is like, I need to replace this bulb. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5003.94s)]
*  I can't think of a good reason. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5006.86s)]
*  Who cares? [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5009.14s)]
*  There's only five light bulbs. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5010.14s)]
*  It's not like it's fucking dark. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5011.26s)]
*  There's no loss of utility. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5012.54s)]
*  But my brain is telling me you should replace that bulb. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5014.0599999999995s)]
*  I like the look of all the light bulbs. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5015.94s)]
*  Aesthetically, one being off. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5017.219999999999s)]
*  Do I really care? [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5018.219999999999s)]
*  Symmetry? [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5019.219999999999s)]
*  I guess symmetry. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5020.219999999999s)]
*  But I mean, yeah, I think you clearly care about aesthetics. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5021.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean, the lights aren't off and on in the bedroom anyway. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5025.139999999999s)]
*  My point is my feeling is stronger than the rationalization for the feeling. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5028.82s)]
*  So a lot of times people have a very strong moral opinion, but their moral reasoning is [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5034.74s)]
*  very, very weak. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5039.66s)]
*  Because a lot of times you don't need strong, you don't need, wait, what was the back end [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5042.18s)]
*  of that? [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5046.62s)]
*  Rationalization. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5047.62s)]
*  You don't need strong rationalization if you're in a group that all agrees with you. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5048.62s)]
*  Yes. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5052.18s)]
*  You don't need steel, man. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5053.18s)]
*  You're done. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5054.18s)]
*  Isn't the illusion of power a little bit better than not having your voice felt at all? [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5055.18s)]
*  Take it down. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5059.1s)]
*  Because now it's like every time I disagree with something, it's going to be January [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5060.1s)]
*  6th or it's going to be. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5064.9400000000005s)]
*  What's the guy in the Matrix who was red-pilled and took the blue pill so he could go back? [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5067.3s)]
*  That's you. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5071.34s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5072.34s)]
*  The great actor, Joey Pants, Joe Pant. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5073.34s)]
*  That's you. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5077.18s)]
*  Yes, you're saying I want to go back and eat the steaks. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5078.18s)]
*  You would go back. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5081.02s)]
*  I would go back. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5082.02s)]
*  You would go back. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5083.02s)]
*  If I'm Neo, I'm not Neo. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5084.02s)]
*  Joey Pants. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5087.02s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5088.02s)]
*  I don't even do Morpheus. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5089.02s)]
*  But yeah, you're right. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5092.02s)]
*  It's like everybody wants to be Neo in the Matrix. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5094.54s)]
*  Everybody else in the Matrix sucks. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5096.74s)]
*  Driving that stupid spaceship around the fucking sewage system. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5098.139999999999s)]
*  They don't suck because they're in their jobs. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5101.139999999999s)]
*  They have families. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5103.86s)]
*  They have happy lives in the Matrix. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5104.86s)]
*  Their lives are great. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5106.74s)]
*  No, everybody outside the Matrix is what he meant to say. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5107.74s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5110.139999999999s)]
*  No, I'm saying in every... [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5111.139999999999s)]
*  Oh, no, no, sorry. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5112.139999999999s)]
*  Outside. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5113.139999999999s)]
*  Everybody in the movie that has already taken the pill, they're driving around these stupid [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5114.139999999999s)]
*  spaceships. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5119.139999999999s)]
*  They're away from their families that are in this underground dungeon. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5120.139999999999s)]
*  They're just fucking miserable. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5121.94s)]
*  Eating sludge. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5122.94s)]
*  Eating sludge. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5123.94s)]
*  The one guy goes back. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5124.94s)]
*  The other guy gets to be fucking Superman every once in a while when he walks into the [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5126.139999999999s)]
*  room. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5129.139999999999s)]
*  But every other red pillar is miserable. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5130.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but H.L. Menken, the great newspaper man for the 20th century, he has this great [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5131.139999999999s)]
*  quote. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5135.419999999999s)]
*  He goes, the average man does not want to be free. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5136.419999999999s)]
*  He simply wants to be safe. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5137.62s)]
*  And this is why we trade our freedom for security all the time. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5139.299999999999s)]
*  We don't say we. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5141.94s)]
*  Okay, the average person. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5143.259999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5145.139999999999s)]
*  And I don't think it's just those people that you were talking about. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5146.139999999999s)]
*  It's not at all. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5147.66s)]
*  We saw it during COVID. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5148.66s)]
*  It's a huge... [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5149.66s)]
*  It was a huge percentage. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5150.66s)]
*  And frankly, I don't blame a lot of them. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5151.66s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5152.66s)]
*  Like I was saying earlier with my fans, if you're someone with a family and you're [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5153.66s)]
*  raising kids, like it's really, I'm not going to sit here and tell you stick your neck out [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5155.9s)]
*  and put their fucking livelihood in danger. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5159.339999999999s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5161.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5162.299999999999s)]
*  The... [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5163.299999999999s)]
*  Martyrdom is overrated. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5164.299999999999s)]
*  That's another reason I'm not a Christian. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5165.78s)]
*  I don't think martyrdom is always a good answer. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5166.78s)]
*  I think it's often a bad answer. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5168.78s)]
*  Yeah, I can tell you even just getting married, my risk aversion has gone down. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5169.78s)]
*  The idea of safety has become, as a father, I'm thinking about both of you one day. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5172.86s)]
*  And safety becomes paramount. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5177.259999999999s)]
*  Yes, and that's appropriate. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5178.62s)]
*  This is my freedom at this point, honestly. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5180.219999999999s)]
*  So let's protect that. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5182.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5183.58s)]
*  And this is what these countries did very well. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5185.0599999999995s)]
*  They know if they get your kids, you're going to do whatever they want. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5188.14s)]
*  So which countries did that? [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5191.3s)]
*  Eastern Europe. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5192.9s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5193.9s)]
*  Like they, when what became the KGB, they would arrest people and there would be your [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5194.9s)]
*  kids' death warrant signed on your desk. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5200.94s)]
*  Wow. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5203.14s)]
*  And it's like, let's name names. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5204.14s)]
*  And this is because Stalin legalized the death penalty to like 12 or 14. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5205.42s)]
*  So right away it's like, if it's not you, it's going to be your kids. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5209.5s)]
*  What's it going to be? [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5212.66s)]
*  Right? [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5214.54s)]
*  You're going to talk. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5215.54s)]
*  Oh yeah, I did 9-11. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5216.54s)]
*  You're singing. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5217.54s)]
*  Whatever you want me to sign. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5218.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5219.54s)]
*  So this is, so the great human experiment of the West or of America. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5220.54s)]
*  Well, one more thing. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5225.62s)]
*  They did this with Canada. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5226.62s)]
*  So the corporate press, who are literal demons, when those truckers were, I'm not kidding. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5228.42s)]
*  No, the truckers. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5232.82s)]
*  When the truckers were having their protests, there were all these articles saying the police [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5233.82s)]
*  should come and take their kids away because these protests aren't safe places for kids. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5238.26s)]
*  There was no violence. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5242.98s)]
*  There was no threats of violence. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5244.299999999999s)]
*  There were a lot of honking and they were advocating and the cops were saying it. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5245.299999999999s)]
*  We might have to come take their kids. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5249.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5251.099999999999s)]
*  You're telling me these people are demons? [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5252.099999999999s)]
*  The idea that they were all white supremacists, like as a guy who knows a lot of Punjabis, [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5254.099999999999s)]
*  I guarantee you a lot of them. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5257.58s)]
*  Listen, I would. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5258.58s)]
*  Listen, you're 100% right. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5259.58s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5260.58s)]
*  No, seriously. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5261.58s)]
*  If your choice is being called a white supremacist or having your kids taken away, I mean, this [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5262.58s)]
*  is. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5267.179999999999s)]
*  It's not even a question. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5268.179999999999s)]
*  I guess what you're trying to say is the way that they were making them radioactive [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5269.179999999999s)]
*  is that they were calling them Nazis or white supremacists. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5272.54s)]
*  And what people don't realize is the truckers in Canada, a large percentage of them are Indian. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5274.58s)]
*  Punjabis in particular often go into trucking and there's tons of them. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5280.26s)]
*  It's got to be the racism or climate change. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5283.3s)]
*  Of course. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5284.9800000000005s)]
*  If it's not climate justice or racism. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5285.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5286.9800000000005s)]
*  Should the state have any role in child rearing at all? [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5287.9800000000005s)]
*  God, no. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5291.66s)]
*  Are you kidding? [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5292.66s)]
*  Really? [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5293.66s)]
*  No. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5294.66s)]
*  Like if there's a. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5295.66s)]
*  Child rearing? [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5296.66s)]
*  Or like, I guess, child protection. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5297.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5298.86s)]
*  Well, that's the big issue. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5299.86s)]
*  There's like a faith healer, like a, like a fundamentalist religious family and their [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5300.86s)]
*  kid has cancer and they're saying, we're going to pray this away. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5304.299999999999s)]
*  We're not going to take them to a doctor. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5306.86s)]
*  So let's talk about this because this is a problem. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5307.86s)]
*  This is a nice tree that we've got a lot of branches. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5310.42s)]
*  This is, this is a, this is something I take very seriously. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5312.66s)]
*  I talk about a lot and I really hate when people politicize like stuff with kids because [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5315.0599999999995s)]
*  they're like, oh, all these people are Democrats. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5321.339999999999s)]
*  We're molesting kids. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5322.94s)]
*  Give me a break. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5324.66s)]
*  So the big problem biologically is that a lot of people who have kids shouldn't have [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5325.66s)]
*  kids. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5331.139999999999s)]
*  I don't mean the sense that they're bad parents. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5332.139999999999s)]
*  I mean that they're doing horrific things to kids that none of us in this room can imagine. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5333.139999999999s)]
*  And a friend of mine named Matt, and he told me to use his name when I was on Rogan came [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5337.38s)]
*  out to me as a child, a victim of childhood sexual abuse. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5340.7s)]
*  I talked about it and I said, people shouldn't have to keep themselves quiet. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5343.94s)]
*  Right? [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5347.3s)]
*  If someone had a dad who was like an alcoholic 50 years ago, you couldn't talk about it. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5348.3s)]
*  Now if that happened to you, Andrew, it would suck. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5351.9s)]
*  I wouldn't look at you any differently. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5353.62s)]
*  The victims of this, they feel like they're embarrassed to say something. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5355.78s)]
*  They shouldn't have to carry that burden their whole lives. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5358.34s)]
*  They should be comfortable to say it and be like, dude, that sucks for you. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5359.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm still going to make rape jokes around you. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5362.62s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5364.06s)]
*  And when I talked about it in Rogan, a bunch more of my friends told me and a bunch of [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5365.5s)]
*  strangers reached out to me. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5370.1s)]
*  And I'm like, holy shit, this is a big fucking huge problem. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5371.78s)]
*  And the thing is I don't have any answer. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5374.3s)]
*  And if anyone tells you the answer is voting Republican or having this kind of system or [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5376.66s)]
*  that kind of system, the problem is it's in the family. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5380.42s)]
*  And there's no system where people who have families have access to those kids. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5383.72s)]
*  And also these predators know how to pass. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5388.12s)]
*  They know where the prey is. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5389.68s)]
*  Any animal must have. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5391.08s)]
*  So this is something I think about a lot. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5392.08s)]
*  I talk about a lot. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5393.64s)]
*  And I really hate these kind of glib, you just got to do this. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5395.08s)]
*  There's not one easy answer for this. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5398.96s)]
*  And I really hate these claims that this is all tinfoil hat paranoia. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5400.68s)]
*  And you guys are making, if you're going to overreact about something to me, this is what [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5404.96s)]
*  this is. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5408.4800000000005s)]
*  This is another reason why I never identify as libertarian because libertarians think [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5409.4800000000005s)]
*  it's just the government or many of them do. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5413.52s)]
*  This has nothing to do with the government. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5415.76s)]
*  This operates independently of the government and the system works very effectively and [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5417.160000000001s)]
*  efficiently and you just nailed it completely. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5420.52s)]
*  The example I was talking about earlier with Roseanne is when I did my book on the New [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5423.200000000001s)]
*  Right, I'd never met Holocaust deniers before. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5426.84s)]
*  And what was fascinating to me as a Jewish person is that all these people who were saying [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5430.360000000001s)]
*  the Holocaust never happened were all saying it should have. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5433.56s)]
*  And I told that to Roseanne, she's like, oh my God, so funny. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5436.240000000001s)]
*  So she's on Theo Von, comedy podcast, Theo Von, who runs a popular comedy podcast, that's [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5439.76s)]
*  how an article should be. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5445.52s)]
*  And she's talking about things like, yeah, you can't say, you know, the vaccine, whatever, [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5446.96s)]
*  and you can't say buying at anyone and knowing votes and the Holocaust never happened. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5450.96s)]
*  So she's using examples of things that are like absurdities that you're not allowed to [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5454.38s)]
*  say. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5457.76s)]
*  They clip it. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5458.76s)]
*  Jewish Roseanne, who identifies as a rabbi, I never said I was a good one. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5459.76s)]
*  That's her line. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5464.280000000001s)]
*  And Roseanne Barr Holocaust denier. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5465.360000000001s)]
*  And it's just like you people. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5468.32s)]
*  And the thing is, it's not possible to look at that whole clip and not realizing she's [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5470.48s)]
*  being sarcastic. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5475.5599999999995s)]
*  It's not possible. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5476.5599999999995s)]
*  Another lefty example, Cenk Uygur, who runs the Young Turks. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5477.88s)]
*  Who? [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5480.92s)]
*  Cenk Uygur? [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5481.92s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5482.92s)]
*  That's how you pronounce the last name. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5483.92s)]
*  He runs the Young Turks. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5484.92s)]
*  He had David Duke on his show, former Klansman David Duke. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5485.92s)]
*  And David Duke is saying, I don't hate Jews. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5488.5599999999995s)]
*  And Cenk Uygur goes, no, of course not. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5490.28s)]
*  New York Times. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5493.5199999999995s)]
*  Cenk Uygur had David Duke on his show. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5494.5199999999995s)]
*  And David Duke said, I don't choose. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5496.88s)]
*  Cenk agreed and said, no, of course not. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5499.36s)]
*  You can't watch that clip. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5502.0s)]
*  This leftist is agreeing with David. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5504.12s)]
*  You cannot honestly think this. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5506.68s)]
*  But when you read it, the transcript, it sure looks that way. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5508.12s)]
*  This is my point about how it is often manipulated. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5511.16s)]
*  And some people are lazy, but a lot of times they know what the fuck they're doing. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5515.28s)]
*  And sometimes both of them are the exact same thing. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5518.56s)]
*  Correct. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5521.68s)]
*  The parameters create the laziness. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5522.68s)]
*  Because if you have parameters, I don't have to do anything. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5524.84s)]
*  The people that will work there and work within these parameters are inspired really just [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5528.84s)]
*  by the carrot. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5532.72s)]
*  And once I have those perfect people that are inspired just by the carrot, they don't [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5533.72s)]
*  give a flying fuck how the art comes out. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5537.08s)]
*  And now you've got control. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5539.400000000001s)]
*  Now here's the problem. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5540.400000000001s)]
*  Who the fuck is creating the parameters? [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5541.400000000001s)]
*  Are multiple people creating them? [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5544.320000000001s)]
*  Are multiple interest groups creating them? [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5545.96s)]
*  Like how? [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5548.320000000001s)]
*  We'll tie this in a second. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5550.68s)]
*  The parameters of Me Too, for example, have been so bastardized. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5553.16s)]
*  Can we talk about Me Too? [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5559.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, well, because the Huberman article, the hit piece came out. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5560.76s)]
*  And here's the thing. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5564.8s)]
*  I feel right now that we're at the point that people immediately rejected it. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5565.8s)]
*  They're just like, another one of these hit pieces. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5570.84s)]
*  This is clearly just a hit job. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5574.48s)]
*  I met one person, and I might talk about the people that I hang out with, but not one person [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5576.84s)]
*  that actually was like, oh, this is a serious piece and we should look into this. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5582.72s)]
*  When I say these people are, these corporate journalists are literal demons, by which I [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5587.16s)]
*  mean entities which are only biologically human. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5591.08s)]
*  Andrew Huberman's entire schtick is helping people with free information, which means [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5594.04s)]
*  it helps poor people more than people have money, how to succeed, how to be better human [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5599.400000000001s)]
*  beings, how to sleep, how to be better neighbors, just thrive. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5604.44s)]
*  It's all positive, no politics, and this is your villain. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5608.84s)]
*  So the hatred I have. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5615.599999999999s)]
*  And what are they accusing him of? [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5617.92s)]
*  Just dating four girls? [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5619.04s)]
*  Yeah, he slept around. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5620.04s)]
*  The hatred I have for these. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5622.04s)]
*  The incredibly handsome rich guy, got some pussy. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5624.44s)]
*  Is that the shocking information? [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5630.679999999999s)]
*  I get why you're laughing, but my thoughts are with this guy whose entire career has [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5632.84s)]
*  been about giving people free information to become better human beings. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5637.72s)]
*  And now in this major piece, he has to know that everyone around him is reading about [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5641.52s)]
*  him hoeing around and looking at him differently. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5645.24s)]
*  And it's just like, it makes me so angry. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5648.56s)]
*  I don't like that argument only because somebody can live their life in the most positive way, [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5650.360000000001s)]
*  but still do nefarious shit. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5655.68s)]
*  But I don't think this is nefarious and it's not my business. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5657.88s)]
*  No, I don't even know the story. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5659.76s)]
*  Well, you're saying just because you do good doesn't mean you can't do bad. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5661.92s)]
*  I agree with that, but he's not doing bad. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5664.24s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5666.0s)]
*  One thing, I don't think he's doing bad. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5667.0s)]
*  And two, I think that people are eye rolling these pieces because they become so frequent. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5668.68s)]
*  It's almost like... [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5674.8s)]
*  Karenism. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5675.8s)]
*  It's Karenism. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5676.8s)]
*  No, Karen isn't. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5677.8s)]
*  Oh, Karen isn't. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5678.8s)]
*  Because there's plenty of uninformed people, like we talked about earlier. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5680.12s)]
*  It's also Karenism. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5682.96s)]
*  Where if you say Andrew Huberman, oh, he's the guy who raped a bunch of women. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5683.96s)]
*  Even though it was a say that in an article, that's what they're hearing. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5686.76s)]
*  I think those pieces, I think those days are done. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5690.12s)]
*  I think there was a time where... [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5692.2s)]
*  I think what often happens though, and this is not to just... [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5693.8s)]
*  Not to say that these people aren't soulless demons or whatever words you're using, but [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5696.68s)]
*  what often happens now, I think, is what I think you're going to find with Huberman is [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5700.16s)]
*  he's going to get more popular. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5703.08s)]
*  Because the people who are eye rolling at these articles who do exist are going to go, [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5704.4s)]
*  oh, they don't like him, so I like him. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5707.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't redistribute through the slightest. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5709.76s)]
*  My point is there's going to be plenty of people now in their head when they hear Andrew Huberman. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5711.16s)]
*  They're going to... [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5716.12s)]
*  All they know about him is like, out. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5716.96s)]
*  Here's the thing, I think there was a time that we... [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5718.84s)]
*  Because that's what happened with Rogan. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5720.72s)]
*  Yeah, but I... [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5721.88s)]
*  I had a friend from college who's like, oh, I hate that guy. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5722.72s)]
*  He could think of a reason. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5724.4800000000005s)]
*  But here's... [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5725.64s)]
*  But I think that was a different time. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5727.16s)]
*  I think there was a time that we grew up in where we didn't know that there was a thing [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5729.12s)]
*  called a hit piece, we just thought it was information. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5732.56s)]
*  Now we know there are things called hit pieces. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5736.68s)]
*  Who's we? [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5738.92s)]
*  Who's we? [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5739.64s)]
*  Yeah, I'm telling you, there's a lot of people that still don't really... [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5740.320000000001s)]
*  We're debating the numbers here, right? [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5743.16s)]
*  You guys think that that number is higher, I think that number is lower. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5745.76s)]
*  I'm not saying that there are no people. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5748.36s)]
*  I think it's a majority are... [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5749.799999999999s)]
*  I think 10%. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5751.839999999999s)]
*  10% taking the face value? [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5753.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5754.639999999999s)]
*  It's like 60. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5755.0s)]
*  I think it's 60. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5755.799999999999s)]
*  I think it's closer to 60 than 10. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5757.639999999999s)]
*  60 is conservative. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5759.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5760.0s)]
*  I think the number is growing. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5760.44s)]
*  I think when we were younger, it was a lot. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5761.799999999999s)]
*  Now I think... [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5764.12s)]
*  Maybe it's less now. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5764.5599999999995s)]
*  But when you see what happened with Rogan, when you see what's CNN... [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5765.799999999999s)]
*  I'm not talking about some fucking online magazine, I'm talking about CNN changes the [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5769.08s)]
*  color of his skin in a picture. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5772.32s)]
*  When you see that CNN can do that, and then you see this... [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5774.12s)]
*  When you see what's happened with Portnoy, when you see this happen over and over again, [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5777.4s)]
*  you're like, oh, this is a trick. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5780.799999999999s)]
*  Andrew, people think Kyle Rittenhouse killed black people. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5782.5199999999995s)]
*  People think Kyle Rittenhouse shot black people. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5785.719999999999s)]
*  I thought that at first. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5788.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5789.5199999999995s)]
*  I thought that until they told me, then I thought I needed a hero. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5790.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5792.28s)]
*  Ah! [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5793.32s)]
*  Fucking hero. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5794.4s)]
*  Yeah, true. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5795.44s)]
*  Fucking Antifa kissing Portnoy or whatever it was. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5796.839999999999s)]
*  G's up. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5799.599999999999s)]
*  G's is up. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5801.44s)]
*  Malice. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5802.48s)]
*  So... [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5805.32s)]
*  He's saying what we're all thinking. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5805.92s)]
*  That's good. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5807.36s)]
*  I feel like the whole... [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5808.64s)]
*  I'm gonna text him again, maybe I'm gonna text him. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5810.32s)]
*  He's back. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5813.4400000000005s)]
*  I think the whole right has a distrust of the media, though. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5814.4400000000005s)]
*  So I think that they can look at this with skepticism. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5816.96s)]
*  There's no one on the right that doesn't believe it. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5818.68s)]
*  No, no, they believe in Fox. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5819.68s)]
*  A lot of the boomers believe in Fox. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5820.68s)]
*  They think Fox is like the, you know what I mean? [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5821.68s)]
*  Sure. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5823.56s)]
*  But Fox isn't putting out the article. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5824.56s)]
*  My point is a lot of the Fox... [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5826.64s)]
*  The New Yorker is. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5828.12s)]
*  Correct, but my point is that a lot of the right do have a trust of some aspect of the [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5829.12s)]
*  media. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5833.12s)]
*  Fair, but that's fair. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5834.12s)]
*  The left-leaning media, I don't think that they trust. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5835.36s)]
*  So I don't think anybody on the right is reading this article and believing it. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5837.92s)]
*  So that's 50%. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5841.0s)]
*  No, it's not 50%, because there's a huge percentage of the population that doesn't care. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5842.0s)]
*  And they're kind of floating around. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5846.72s)]
*  And they're the ones who are now in their head, oh, Andrew Hubert, oh, he's a bad guy. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5848.44s)]
*  And then I think he's saying the majority of people don't dive deeper than the sources [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5851.4s)]
*  they trust at large. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5855.44s)]
*  Also, CNN, Fox, and the New Yorker. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5857.2s)]
*  The New Yorker punches voters culturally. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5859.76s)]
*  Do you see how long the fucking article is also? [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5860.76s)]
*  No, I don't want... [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5862.76s)]
*  The article is so long that you'd never read it. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5863.76s)]
*  So, and I think it's by design. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5866.320000000001s)]
*  I think that they're just like, here's the headline, look at all these, oh, the cursor [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5868.24s)]
*  is still this small, is it going down? [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5871.280000000001s)]
*  So I couldn't believe how much... [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5872.68s)]
*  I had scrolled so much and this on the side, it's barely going down. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5874.2s)]
*  All that to say you got some posts. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5877.76s)]
*  My hope, and I don't think it's much of a hope, and I'm sure I'll be in a room with [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5878.8s)]
*  him at some point, is that this, like with Elon, really radicalizes Andrew Huberman and [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5882.96s)]
*  he realizes the depravity of the enemy class. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5887.92s)]
*  Because with Elon, it was like, oh, Elon's from South Africa. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5890.88s)]
*  You know they had apartheid there. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5893.56s)]
*  And it's like, what the fuck are you talking about? [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5894.56s)]
*  Just complete shamelessness. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5897.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5898.0s)]
*  Yeah, what do you think about Elon's very open political opinions on X? [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5899.0s)]
*  I love it. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5905.2s)]
*  I'm pretty sure he's read The White Pill, which is really cool. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5907.4800000000005s)]
*  I wish he'd tweet about it. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5909.76s)]
*  He followed me, which is really, really exciting. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5911.96s)]
*  I'm waiting to slide into his DMs. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5914.28s)]
*  I'm like waiting for that fucking opportunity. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5916.4800000000005s)]
*  I almost did the Jew hands. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5918.28s)]
*  I almost did, I caught myself. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5919.679999999999s)]
*  When I'm at home and from the mirror thinking about it, I do it. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5928.679999999999s)]
*  It's not like I cast a reflection, but I do it. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5931.679999999999s)]
*  Malice, we have books that you need, that people need to read, many of which that you [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5936.679999999999s)]
*  have written. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5942.24s)]
*  These ones are true. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5946.08s)]
*  Try that sentence again, dude. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5947.08s)]
*  Well, there are books that people need to read, many of them you've written, but there's [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5950.08s)]
*  also books you haven't read that they should read. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5953.5599999999995s)]
*  He said Jonathan Heineck, you should read first. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5955.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5956.5599999999995s)]
*  I thought that was all. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5957.5599999999995s)]
*  Okay, I'll take it back. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5958.5599999999995s)]
*  I'll take it back. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5959.5599999999995s)]
*  Which one should we read first? [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5960.5599999999995s)]
*  Who's we? [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5961.5599999999995s)]
*  Us, here at this table. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5962.5599999999995s)]
*  Whichever interests you more. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5964.36s)]
*  If you want a collection of essays, it's an Anarchist handbook, but I think The White [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5965.84s)]
*  Pill is the one, it's my greatest achievement. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5968.599999999999s)]
*  That's the one everyone should read. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5971.88s)]
*  And it is about the rise and fall of the Russian Empire? [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5972.88s)]
*  And it's also about the victory of good over evil. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5976.48s)]
*  Wow. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5978.44s)]
*  And that's something that I think all of us can be motivated by and take. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5979.44s)]
*  And the fact that it's happened in our lifetimes, you know what I mean? [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5982.839999999999s)]
*  You're saying the Russia, the fall of the Soviet Union and the rise of Russia. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5985.04s)]
*  No, the rise and fall of the Soviet Union. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5989.639999999999s)]
*  Oh, got you. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5991.639999999999s)]
*  The triumph of good over evil. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5992.639999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5993.88s)]
*  And it's a very dark but very beautiful story. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5994.88s)]
*  Okay, I'm going to indulge in this. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5997.24s)]
*  And then you have another thing you're working on. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=5999.639999999999s)]
*  Can you talk about it at all a little bit? [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6001.66s)]
*  I do. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6003.36s)]
*  You were talking about the case for civil war. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6004.36s)]
*  Oh, can we not talk about that? [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6008.36s)]
*  It's not called the case for civil war. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6010.679999999999s)]
*  You were like, put black people back in the... [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6012.36s)]
*  They were happier. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6016.36s)]
*  They were singing their songs. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6018.36s)]
*  They got jobs. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6020.36s)]
*  Sometimes they're in the house. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6022.36s)]
*  Did you know much Disney, Song of the South? [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6024.36s)]
*  They sing with the animals, birds talking to them, except for that rabbit. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6028.36s)]
*  Fucking rabbits, dude. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6033.36s)]
*  Here's what's going to happen. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6034.36s)]
*  When the book's done, I will text you and you'll say, what's it about? [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6035.36s)]
*  And I'll tell you, you'll go, wow. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6038.36s)]
*  And then a year later, you'll have me on the show. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6040.36s)]
*  That'd be perfect. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6042.36s)]
*  And that other person will tell you about it in a second. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6043.36s)]
*  But I have heard you talk about this a little bit. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6045.36s)]
*  I think you might need to clarify it a little bit. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6048.36s)]
*  Share the story. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6050.36s)]
*  America's in need for a national divorce. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6051.36s)]
*  National divorce, how do you want to say it? [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6055.36s)]
*  I'm actually doing a crowdfunding for a graphic novel I'm doing. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6057.36s)]
*  That's the kind of a pet project. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6061.36s)]
*  But yeah, I'm going to be trying to get together my book about national divorce, [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6063.36s)]
*  which I started that whole bandwagon when I run. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6066.36s)]
*  2016, I think. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6069.36s)]
*  And you believe that that should happen? [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6070.36s)]
*  It's going to happen. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6072.36s)]
*  Based on? [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6073.36s)]
*  I don't think there's any mechanism in place other than extreme violence, [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6074.36s)]
*  which I'm desperately hoping to avoid, to bring America closer together as a country, [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6080.36s)]
*  as opposed to further separating apart. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6086.36s)]
*  And I think that's kind of indisputable. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6089.36s)]
*  I don't think anyone... [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6091.36s)]
*  And do you think Americans are so young and unaware of history [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6092.36s)]
*  that we believe that that's not just something that happens to a country every few hundred years? [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6095.36s)]
*  If you look at the size of the nations in Europe, they've changed drastically over time. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6100.36s)]
*  I just think the difference is, especially because of social media, [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6105.36s)]
*  it's harder and harder to find a reason to talk to people whose worldview you disagree with. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6108.36s)]
*  And when that's the case, what is the argument for having kind of this, [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6113.36s)]
*  at least two, if not more, cultures under one roof? [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6117.36s)]
*  Especially cultures who genuinely despise each other. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6119.36s)]
*  Yeah. I guess the reason would be safety, [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6122.36s)]
*  but I think that Americans are just so far removed from the idea of a water border and why that's valuable. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6125.36s)]
*  Yeah. I'm also much more worried about being invaded by Washington than Beijing. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6130.36s)]
*  Yeah. And also, the invasion wouldn't be with personality. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6134.36s)]
*  Invasion would be with culture. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6138.36s)]
*  So the idea of having protection from invasion because you have water on both sides [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6139.36s)]
*  doesn't really give you the same advantage as it did back in the day. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6144.36s)]
*  Yeah. This boomer argument that if America split up, then China's going to invade tomorrow. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6147.36s)]
*  What do they want? [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6151.36s)]
*  And how? And Canada and the rest of the world's going to be like, [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6153.36s)]
*  well, they're divorced now, so I guess we're just going to let this happen. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6156.36s)]
*  I'm going to talk about that in the book. It makes no sense to me. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6159.36s)]
*  OK. I want to hear more about it. You're a fascinating dude. Thank you so much for... [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6162.36s)]
*  I really appreciate you coming, but I also appreciate you. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6165.36s)]
*  And I say this again, the steelman arguments I think are really valuable, [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6168.36s)]
*  and I think that they pacify anybody who's consuming this bit of information [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6172.36s)]
*  that they might completely disregard and disagree with. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6178.36s)]
*  All of a sudden, you hear the perspective that they feel, and you're like, [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6181.36s)]
*  OK, so that does make sense, and he sees my point of view. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6184.36s)]
*  But this other thing is pretty interesting as well. I think it's really effective. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6186.36s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6190.36s)]
*  And I'm glad that you shared that, man. Thank you so much. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6191.36s)]
*  Thank you. You are welcome. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6193.36s)]
*  Yeah. Fuck your shoes, bro. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6194.36s)]
*  Thank you, bro. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6196.36s)]
*  That's the closing. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6199.36s)]
*  His shoes are sick. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG27ZQQaunE&t=6201.36s)]
