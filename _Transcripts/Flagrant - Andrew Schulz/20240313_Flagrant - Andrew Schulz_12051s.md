# CIA Spy on Killing Kennedy’s, China’s Takeover, & Israel-Palestine
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [March 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk)
*  Is it part of your jurisdiction working for CIA to put holes in Kennedys? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=0.0s)]
*  First of all, we don't call them jurisdictions, we call them authorities. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4.72s)]
*  What a strong denial! [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8.0s)]
*  I wanted to tell you why I think you're still part of the CIA. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10.0s)]
*  I am not a part of CIA, it's not true. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=12.0s)]
*  It's not called the CIA, it's just called CIA. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=14.0s)]
*  I'm gonna get you to call it the CIA, then I win, then I'm the super spy. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=16.8s)]
*  There's a presidential election coming up in November. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  There is no good outcome. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Trump said, you guys are a bunch of idiots who keep calling me a Russian spy. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  All of a sudden that called into question whether CIA even knew what they were doing. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=26.2s)]
*  He chooses not to use CIA? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=29.2s)]
*  Private intelligence can do things that national security can't do. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=31.2s)]
*  Aliens, UFOs, real or not? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=34.2s)]
*  UFOs are real, but they're not aliens. It's us. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=36.2s)]
*  Did you ever kill somebody? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=39.2s)]
*  I cannot answer that question in great detail. I can't say that I've never intimately killed anybody. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=40.2s)]
*  What I think is gonna happen is Zelensky, Netanyahu are gonna get political sanctuary asylum in the United States. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=44.2s)]
*  The United States can't let Zelensky die. Everybody knows Putin wants to kill him. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=48.2s)]
*  What do you think happens? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=51.2s)]
*  In Israel, Palestine? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=52.2s)]
*  Alex thinks Chinatown is a cell. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=53.2s)]
*  You're right. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=56.2s)]
*  What the f***? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=57.2s)]
*  Chinatown is a diaspora of Chinese immigrants, so the intelligence community plants its own operatives inside that community. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=59.2s)]
*  But keep in mind that the CIA... [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=64.2s)]
*  The what? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=66.2s)]
*  God! [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=67.2s)]
*  He's my asset! [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=68.2s)]
*  This is my asset! [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=69.2s)]
*  What's up everybody and welcome to Flagrant and today I'm very excited because we're gonna expose... [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=71.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=78.2s)]
*  That's a good YouTube title you got it right. Expose... [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=79.2s)]
*  Reveal. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=81.2s)]
*  Reveal. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=82.2s)]
*  Secrets. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=83.2s)]
*  Secrets. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=84.2s)]
*  CIA operative. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=85.2s)]
*  Who's still working for the CIA as I say, but we'll get to that in a little bit. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=86.2s)]
*  We got Andrew Bustamante. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=90.2s)]
*  Hey! [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=91.2s)]
*  Every day was fine. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=92.2s)]
*  Thank you so much for coming in. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=93.2s)]
*  Okay, we have to do this thing which you've said this on every podcast that you've been on. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=94.2s)]
*  But I do want to just set a baseline understanding. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=98.2s)]
*  What is... [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=101.2s)]
*  Are you wearing leather? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=102.2s)]
*  It's fake leather. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=104.2s)]
*  Yo! [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=105.2s)]
*  It's leather. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=106.2s)]
*  That was crazy Al. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=107.2s)]
*  I didn't even notice that. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=108.2s)]
*  You know a little something. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=109.2s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=110.2s)]
*  I had to guess. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=111.2s)]
*  Fair enough. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=112.2s)]
*  Look how casual his... [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=114.2s)]
*  I know what I was gonna say. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=115.2s)]
*  I'm rocking some Tiger Strayed sweatpants. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=116.2s)]
*  You didn't get the memo man. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=118.2s)]
*  I'm wearing leather today bro. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=120.2s)]
*  Alright, alright. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=122.2s)]
*  We do have to understand a few things here, right? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=123.2s)]
*  What the fuck is going on? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=126.2s)]
*  That threw me for a loop. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=128.2s)]
*  Okay, you dress like Janet Jackson dude. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=130.2s)]
*  Okay, we need to know what is the CIA? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=134.2s)]
*  I know you've answered this on every single podcast, but I do think it's important. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=137.2s)]
*  What is the CIA? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=139.2s)]
*  CIA, the Central Intelligence Agency. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=141.2s)]
*  Yeah, and why do you say CIA? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=144.2s)]
*  You never go the CIA. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=145.2s)]
*  So the CIA is something that is commonly... [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=146.2s)]
*  It's a misconception by the American public. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=150.2s)]
*  It's not called the CIA. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=152.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=154.2s)]
*  When you talk about it as an acronym, it's just called CIA, Central Intelligence Agency. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=155.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=158.2s)]
*  The CIA is... [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=159.2s)]
*  It's silly grammatical stuff, but then it makes it sound like CIA itself is a word. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=161.2s)]
*  It's not. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=165.2s)]
*  It's an acronym. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=166.2s)]
*  So if you're trying to act like you're not part of the CIA, you call it the CIA? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=167.2s)]
*  Bingo. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=170.2s)]
*  But if you're casting one slip and then you know they're a fucking spy, die. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=171.2s)]
*  Correct. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=174.2s)]
*  I'm nice dude. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=175.2s)]
*  I'm fucking nice. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=176.2s)]
*  If you want to know if somebody is part of the Brotherhood, then you call it the Agency. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=177.2s)]
*  Oh. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=182.2s)]
*  Because there's only one. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=183.2s)]
*  Different Brotherhood. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=184.2s)]
*  So you just call it the Agency. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=189.2s)]
*  You're part of the Agency. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=190.2s)]
*  There's only one CIA though, so it is the CIA. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=191.2s)]
*  I mean, I'm not going to argue with you if you want to keep calling it the CIA. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=194.2s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=198.2s)]
*  That was a good trick right there. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=199.2s)]
*  I know. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=200.2s)]
*  I changed levels on you real quick. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=201.2s)]
*  When I talk to somebody and I want to see if they actually know what they're talking [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=202.2s)]
*  about, they say the Agency. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=204.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=205.2s)]
*  So, okay. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=206.2s)]
*  CIA, what is it? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=207.2s)]
*  CIA is the national security arm for the United States that collects foreign secrets. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=208.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=213.2s)]
*  So we don't collect domestic secrets, which means secrets inside the United States. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=214.2s)]
*  We are charged with only foreign secrets. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=217.2s)]
*  The FBI, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, collects secrets inside the United States. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=219.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=224.2s)]
*  So is it part of your jurisdiction when you're working for CIA to put holes in Kennedys? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=225.2s)]
*  Because that doesn't feel international. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=232.2s)]
*  That feels like really national. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=236.2s)]
*  So you bring up a great point right out of the gate. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=238.2s)]
*  So first of all, we don't call them jurisdictions. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=240.2s)]
*  We call them authorities. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=241.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=242.2s)]
*  So inside. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=243.2s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=244.2s)]
*  That's what you're wrong. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=245.2s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=246.2s)]
*  What a strong deny. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=247.2s)]
*  This is good. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=248.2s)]
*  This is good. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=249.2s)]
*  We don't call them Kennedys. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=250.2s)]
*  We call them Jelly. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=251.2s)]
*  I hate what you just said. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=252.2s)]
*  It's so... [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=253.2s)]
*  We have authorities, and authorities define what we can and can't do. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=254.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=257.2s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=258.2s)]
*  That's what makes us different than, say, police jurisdictions. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=259.2s)]
*  What can you not do? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=261.2s)]
*  Because it feels like you guys can do... [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=262.2s)]
*  We can do a lot. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=263.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=264.2s)]
*  Central intelligence can do a lot because the agency is charged with foreign secrets. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=265.2s)]
*  And foreign secrets don't violate American citizen rights. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=268.2s)]
*  Which is why when you hear about like, oh, you guys sell drugs in the Middle East, and [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=272.2s)]
*  you guys do this, and you guys do that, and you don't know what you're doing, and you [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=276.2s)]
*  And you run cocaine like, fuck yes, we'll do whatever we need to do if it keeps Americans [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=280.2s)]
*  safe. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=286.2s)]
*  Gotcha, but you can't do any of that stuff here. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=287.2s)]
*  Correct. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=288.2s)]
*  Now, there's also an important divide that happened in 2001, 9-11. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=289.2s)]
*  I mean, right here we're in New York, so we all know, we all remember that day well. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=291.2s)]
*  Prior to 9-11, you had a very different CIA than what you had after 9-11. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=296.2s)]
*  How so? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=301.2s)]
*  Because of the 9-11 commission. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=302.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=303.2s)]
*  Keep in mind that 9-11 happened because CIA fucked up. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=304.2s)]
*  CIA and FBI dropped the ball. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=306.2s)]
*  You know what we're talking about, right? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=308.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=309.2s)]
*  Why would he know? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=310.2s)]
*  Why would he know? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=311.2s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=312.2s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=313.2s)]
*  He knows because he's saying yes. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=314.2s)]
*  Now I'm nervous. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=317.2s)]
*  I thought that too. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=318.2s)]
*  Did you know about it? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=319.2s)]
*  Yeah, well, I didn't know about it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=320.2s)]
*  I wasn't in CIA. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=323.2s)]
*  But they had leads that there were people planning an attack on the World Trade Center. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=324.2s)]
*  They had information and they just chose not to act on it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=328.2s)]
*  Whether it was they didn't think it was serious or whether it was maybe this will help us [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=331.2s)]
*  get power, who knows? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=334.2s)]
*  Let your own theories run wild. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=335.2s)]
*  Exactly right. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=336.2s)]
*  But that is exactly right. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=337.2s)]
*  Yep, it's exactly right. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=338.2s)]
*  And he even said he's not too far. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=339.2s)]
*  He's a little too much on that. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=340.2s)]
*  He even said it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=341.2s)]
*  You can't be 100% right on that one. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=342.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=343.2s)]
*  What the hell? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=344.2s)]
*  It feels like you would need insider information to be 100% right on that one. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=345.2s)]
*  That's the inside information. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=346.2s)]
*  They knew what was happening. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=347.2s)]
*  I know CIA. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=348.2s)]
*  He looks like them too. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=349.2s)]
*  All I'm saying is you have now referenced CIA twice without using the. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=350.2s)]
*  So power. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=351.2s)]
*  I did that for you. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=352.2s)]
*  I appreciate you. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=353.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=354.2s)]
*  So the 9-11 commission, the September 11 commission, the 9-11 commission, the 9-11 commission, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=355.2s)]
*  the 9-11 commission, the 9-11 commission, the 9-11 commission, the 9-11 commission, the [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=356.2s)]
*  which was published in 2003 was written at the behest of Congress and it was in that [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=357.7s)]
*  very public report where all of what you're saying was referenced. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=373.65999999999997s)]
*  The FBI and CIA, you read, power to you, man, FBI and CIA separately had all the information [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=377.28s)]
*  they needed to prevent 9-11. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=384.64s)]
*  And? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=386.09999999999997s)]
*  share the information with each other, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=387.1s)]
*  which meant that they couldn't put all the pieces [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=388.94s)]
*  in the right order. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=390.46000000000004s)]
*  But isn't that the CIA's fault? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=391.28000000000003s)]
*  Nope. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=392.18s)]
*  That is a failure of what the 9-11 Commission identified [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=393.06s)]
*  as no overarching national intelligence directive. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=396.3s)]
*  I thought that's what the CIA is. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=399.66s)]
*  CIA is, technically it's the Central Intelligence Agency, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=401.34000000000003s)]
*  which means it is the hub of intelligence. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=404.58000000000004s)]
*  It was never the hub of decision making [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=407.14000000000004s)]
*  for where intelligence goes. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=408.88s)]
*  Ah, so it collects all the intelligence. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=410.46000000000004s)]
*  It collects from the FBI, it collects from the NSA, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=412.46000000000004s)]
*  it collects from all these other different organizations, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=414.78000000000003s)]
*  but it doesn't disseminate it to the people that need to. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=416.7s)]
*  And it doesn't, it used to, prior to 9-11, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=419.26s)]
*  it did not prioritize it correctly either. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=421.58s)]
*  So you're part of CIA, you're part of FBI, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=423.3s)]
*  who do you as CIA think has the best information? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=426.21999999999997s)]
*  You think you do. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=430.09999999999997s)]
*  So when he sends you a report that says [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=430.98s)]
*  some shit's gonna happen, you're like, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=432.46s)]
*  ah, shit's not gonna happen. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=434.3s)]
*  So I got my intel, my intel's better. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=435.41999999999996s)]
*  I wanna get into, that's something I wanna get into, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=437.41999999999996s)]
*  but continue on this real quick. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=439.53999999999996s)]
*  Continue making this point. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=441.14s)]
*  Okay, so what changes after 9-11? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=442.41999999999996s)]
*  So what I wanna get into. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=443.78s)]
*  After 9-11, Congress basically comes in and says, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=444.62s)]
*  CIA, the blood's on your hands. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=446.7s)]
*  FBI, the blood's on your hands. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=449.38s)]
*  You both failed America because you are continuing [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=451.18s)]
*  to prosecute intelligence like it's the Cold War. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=453.9s)]
*  And you've ignored terrorism, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=457.26s)]
*  you've ignored the development of authoritarian regimes. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=458.7s)]
*  You've dropped the ball, so now we are gonna step in [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=462.82s)]
*  and force you to evolve. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=465.98s)]
*  So then from there, they, was the birth [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=467.9s)]
*  of the National Director of Intelligence. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=470.44s)]
*  And an overarching authority [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=472.36s)]
*  for all the intelligence community [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=474.24s)]
*  that now does have the jurisdiction [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=476.4s)]
*  or the responsibility of saying, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=479.44s)]
*  CIA, you must listen to FBI, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=481.0s)]
*  you must prioritize this, you must do that. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=482.71999999999997s)]
*  So now instead of kicking information to each other [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=484.12s)]
*  and ignoring it, they have to go to this overseeing board [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=485.8s)]
*  and an overseeing board dictates what actions they need to. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=488.04s)]
*  Correct. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=490.12s)]
*  That's the National Director of Intelligence. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=491.12s)]
*  Who appoints that person? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=492.96s)]
*  Are they appointed? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=495.03999999999996s)]
*  The president. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=496.28s)]
*  And can the president appoint a new one? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=497.52s)]
*  Every new president? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=500.08s)]
*  Correct. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=500.92s)]
*  I don't believe it. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=501.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=502.76s)]
*  I don't believe that we are going to allow a new dude [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=503.59999999999997s)]
*  to come in, set up shop every four years, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=508.59999999999997s)]
*  maybe every eight years, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=511.64s)]
*  and expect that company to function properly. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=513.28s)]
*  That's not how companies function properly. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=516.4399999999999s)]
*  McDonald's wouldn't function like that, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=518.4s)]
*  Exxon wouldn't function like that. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=519.92s)]
*  He could be a figurehead. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=521.16s)]
*  Well, that's what I'm trying to say. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=522.88s)]
*  You need long-term vision. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=524.24s)]
*  This is what I hoped the CIA was doing. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=526.24s)]
*  I hoped that the president of the United States [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=528.08s)]
*  was a figurehead and that you guys [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=529.92s)]
*  were actually keeping the fucking train on the tracks. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=531.8s)]
*  So you're thinking about CIA as a company. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=533.8s)]
*  CIA is a federal. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=536.56s)]
*  I'm gonna get you to call it the CIA today. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=537.64s)]
*  CIA. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=539.4399999999999s)]
*  And I win, then I'm the super spy. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=540.28s)]
*  CIA is a federal government organization. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=542.76s)]
*  So stop thinking of them like Exxon [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=545.4399999999999s)]
*  and think of them more like the local DMV. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=547.0s)]
*  When was the last time you went to the DMV? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=549.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=551.24s)]
*  That's terrifying. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=552.08s)]
*  And that's what people need to understand, right? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=552.92s)]
*  It is a well-intentioned institution, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=555.24s)]
*  but it is still a government organization. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=557.84s)]
*  It's run like the DMV. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=559.56s)]
*  It is not run like Shell. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=560.92s)]
*  Because we think of them as not even having [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=562.28s)]
*  the best intentions, but incredibly effective, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=564.92s)]
*  nefarious intentions, hoarding power, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=566.9599999999999s)]
*  and you're saying they're kind of just [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=569.16s)]
*  a bumbling government organization. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=570.4799999999999s)]
*  Look at the larger government overall right now. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=572.4799999999999s)]
*  See, I don't subscribe to this. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=575.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm really glad you don't subscribe to this. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=578.2399999999999s)]
*  I don't believe it. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=579.92s)]
*  Because could you imagine the chaos [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=580.76s)]
*  if Americans actually were like, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=581.92s)]
*  what do you mean CIA is just like the presidential elections? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=584.16s)]
*  If people actually understood. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=587.4399999999999s)]
*  I don't think it would cause any more chaos. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=588.8399999999999s)]
*  To me, like the CIA, Americans watch Homeland. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=590.5999999999999s)]
*  They're like, yeah, that's what they do. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=593.4799999999999s)]
*  And then they stop terrorism. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=594.4s)]
*  And I don't think they actually really care. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=595.3599999999999s)]
*  You are, you know, you're deep in. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=596.88s)]
*  You're entrenched. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=600.04s)]
*  So I think that you inflate its importance [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=600.88s)]
*  to the average American. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=603.04s)]
*  I think we think it's important, and then we check out. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=604.3199999999999s)]
*  No, but we need to feel safe. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=606.3599999999999s)]
*  We need to feel safe if we feel. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=608.04s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not saying it doesn't make us feel safe. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=609.88s)]
*  What I'm saying is we don't think about it. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=611.52s)]
*  No. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=613.28s)]
*  It's never on, the average American spends [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=614.12s)]
*  20 seconds of their years thinking about the CIA [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=617.28s)]
*  outside of a TV show. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=619.68s)]
*  A very powerful tool for any politician to be like, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=620.52s)]
*  yo, you know you guys aren't safe. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=622.52s)]
*  The CIA, CIA, whatever, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=624.24s)]
*  they're actually kind of bumbling idiots. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=625.9599999999999s)]
*  I can come fix that. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=627.36s)]
*  You have no idea how shoddy things are. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=628.68s)]
*  I've been there. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=630.28s)]
*  That is a super- [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=631.12s)]
*  Do you really think they're bumbling idiots? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=632.0799999999999s)]
*  I mean, you work though. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=633.68s)]
*  No, I don't think they're bumbling idiots. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=634.52s)]
*  I think they're a well-intentioned government organization. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=635.56s)]
*  I think that the challenge that CIA has [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=637.68s)]
*  is that it has a lot of very smart, very hardworking, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=640.3199999999999s)]
*  very dedicated heroes who work as worker bees. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=643.08s)]
*  And then you have political appointees [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=649.0s)]
*  and career-seeking guvies [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=651.0s)]
*  who become the senior level managers. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=655.88s)]
*  So when you are in government, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=658.0s)]
*  you only have one track to promotion, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=660.6800000000001s)]
*  and that is to further entrench yourself in government. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=662.64s)]
*  When you're in the commercial sector, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=665.96s)]
*  when you're like a corporate executive, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=667.36s)]
*  you actually want to broaden and challenge a status quo [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=669.84s)]
*  because you might work for Shell this year, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=672.2s)]
*  but then next year you might get hired by Exxon, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=673.88s)]
*  and then next year you might get hired by Amazon, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=675.72s)]
*  and then next year you might get hired by Google. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=677.4000000000001s)]
*  So you want to constantly broaden [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=679.88s)]
*  and challenge a status quo, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=681.48s)]
*  whereas in government, you have one way to promotion. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=682.5600000000001s)]
*  Entrench yourself in the status quo. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=685.36s)]
*  And deeper. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=687.1600000000001s)]
*  And so bureaucracy inevitably just takes over [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=688.0s)]
*  and clogs it up. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=690.08s)]
*  Correct. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=690.9200000000001s)]
*  So that's what ends up happening, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=691.76s)]
*  and those are the people who are in charge. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=692.84s)]
*  And then you've got this whole workforce at the bottom [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=695.0400000000001s)]
*  that has to decide what is my career path going to be? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=697.96s)]
*  Do I entrench to try to climb, or do I bail the fuck out? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=701.36s)]
*  And what you've seen ever since the Trump election in 2016 [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=705.12s)]
*  is a mass exodus of people in the intelligence community [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=709.08s)]
*  because Trump challenged the intelligence community, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=712.88s)]
*  just like you said, right? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=715.84s)]
*  And once he challenged it and said, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=717.36s)]
*  "'You guys are a bunch of idiots. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=718.48s)]
*  "'You keep calling me a Russian spy,' [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=719.32s)]
*  all of a sudden that called into question [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=722.4s)]
*  whether, see, I even knew what they were doing. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=723.96s)]
*  Okay, I want to talk about the Trump thing. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=725.9200000000001s)]
*  Trump steps in and he chooses not to use CIA [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=728.8399999999999s)]
*  for his intelligence? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=733.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=734.9599999999999s)]
*  He openly says that? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=735.8s)]
*  Correct. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=736.8s)]
*  And then who does he use? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=737.64s)]
*  He commercializes, he hires commercial intelligence. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=738.92s)]
*  Wow, that was good. For example, like, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=741.52s)]
*  do you know James Baker? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=743.5999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=745.0s)]
*  So James, who used to work for the CIA, like you, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=745.8399999999999s)]
*  used to work, and now he has his own [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=750.5999999999999s)]
*  private intelligence firm. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=752.16s)]
*  So would Trump, I love James, by the way, great guy, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=753.4799999999999s)]
*  we call them for the Netflix show, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=756.6s)]
*  100% still works for the CIA. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=757.76s)]
*  1,000%. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=759.4s)]
*  I love you, he's so fucking talented, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=760.9200000000001s)]
*  like he can host a comedy show, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=762.8000000000001s)]
*  he'll be on Fox News hosting a show, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=764.28s)]
*  but 100% still works for the CIA. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=765.96s)]
*  And that's like the best position, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=767.72s)]
*  which I think you also do, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=769.84s)]
*  but we'll get to that in a second. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=770.96s)]
*  Now, he would hire him and then get his intelligence [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=772.0s)]
*  from him and his company. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=775.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=777.24s)]
*  So the reason that that works, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=778.28s)]
*  the idea of commercialized intelligence, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=780.24s)]
*  or private intelligence is what it's called on the inside, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=782.8000000000001s)]
*  private intelligence is a successful business model, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=785.4s)]
*  because private intelligence can do things [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=788.24s)]
*  that national security governance can't do. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=789.92s)]
*  For example? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=792.3199999999999s)]
*  The war on drugs. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=793.36s)]
*  It's very difficult for you to get congressional funding [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=794.88s)]
*  to fight the war on drugs, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=797.56s)]
*  doing things as inefficiently [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=799.56s)]
*  as the federal government does them. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=800.9599999999999s)]
*  You gotta send troops, you gotta get orders approved, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=802.8s)]
*  like there's a huge cost that comes [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=805.16s)]
*  with all the administrative stuff [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=806.52s)]
*  of getting the government to do something. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=807.4399999999999s)]
*  In the commercial sector, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=808.84s)]
*  you basically write them a check for $2 million [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=810.3199999999999s)]
*  and say, hey, we need secrets about cocaine drug lords. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=812.4s)]
*  And then the company does whatever they need to do [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=815.6s)]
*  to get those secrets. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=818.28s)]
*  So maybe they hire five former SEALs, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=819.12s)]
*  two former Colombian special forces, two former Mossad, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=821.6800000000001s)]
*  and they go in and maybe they do good things, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=825.8000000000001s)]
*  maybe they do bad things, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=828.08s)]
*  but they definitely deliver secrets. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=828.92s)]
*  Right? Wow. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=831.16s)]
*  And that's where private intelligence becomes powerful. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=832.0s)]
*  And Donald Trump- [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=833.92s)]
*  It's the efficiency of privatization. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=834.76s)]
*  Donald Trump knew that and took advantage of that. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=836.6800000000001s)]
*  And as a result of that, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=838.6800000000001s)]
*  he essentially showed in four years [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=840.2s)]
*  that CIA was super powerful, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=843.32s)]
*  but can be replaced by private intelligence. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=845.96s)]
*  Wow. Wow. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=848.84s)]
*  Okay, so then you, I think it was on LexusPod, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=849.6800000000001s)]
*  you were speaking about this a little bit. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=851.72s)]
*  And then he also limited something. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=853.36s)]
*  He limited security clearance [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=856.36s)]
*  for people who would leave CIA. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=858.5200000000001s)]
*  This is important. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=859.96s)]
*  This is important because this was one of the things [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=860.8000000000001s)]
*  that Trump did very well that he never got credit for. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=862.72s)]
*  The way that you make money [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=867.5600000000001s)]
*  when you're a federal government employee [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=868.58s)]
*  is not being a federal government employee. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=870.0s)]
*  Like 30 years and you're a senior ranking officer [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=872.7199999999999s)]
*  and you're making $160,000 a year. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=875.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. No. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=877.7199999999999s)]
*  That's not what people wanna do with their life, right? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=878.8s)]
*  A junior salesperson can make 250. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=880.52s)]
*  So what ends up happening is you work those 30 years [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=883.0799999999999s)]
*  so that you can build a network [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=885.7199999999999s)]
*  and so you can have very high level clearances. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=887.5999999999999s)]
*  And those clearances don't expire the day you resign. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=889.88s)]
*  They expire with time. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=892.12s)]
*  So when you have a top secret clearance or a secret clearance, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=894.0s)]
*  the thing that makes it expire is either you break a law [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=896.48s)]
*  and they pull it from you, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=899.16s)]
*  or you don't engage in activity. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=900.0s)]
*  You don't engage in a job where you use that access. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=903.2s)]
*  As long as you keep using that access, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=906.28s)]
*  it keeps being valid. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=907.88s)]
*  The job is for the government or can it be any job? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=909.48s)]
*  It's a job for the government [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=912.36s)]
*  because the government is what defines classification. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=913.4s)]
*  Got it. Right? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=915.48s)]
*  So now you're a senior intelligence officer [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=916.32s)]
*  making $160,000 a year. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=919.92s)]
*  You retire from government. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=921.84s)]
*  Well, now you have all the contacts [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=923.56s)]
*  of all the other offices inside the agency. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=925.2s)]
*  You have contacts with FBI, NSA, DIA, NGA, right? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=927.1999999999999s)]
*  You're connected to everybody. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=930.7199999999999s)]
*  So then Booz Allen Hamilton or Khaki or Mantek [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=932.36s)]
*  or any one of the big national security [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=936.76s)]
*  intelligence contractors, they can hire you, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=939.0s)]
*  make you a executive vice president, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=942.24s)]
*  pay you $400,000 a year. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=944.36s)]
*  And they're essentially paying for your clearance. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=946.16s)]
*  And what they're paying for is for your access [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=947.6s)]
*  to all these other agencies because of your network. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=950.0799999999999s)]
*  So Trump shut that down because he was, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=952.04s)]
*  there was like a brain drain, if you will. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=953.92s)]
*  People are leaving the agency to go work [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=955.6s)]
*  in the private sector and go make money. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=957.84s)]
*  And he was like, you're not gonna leave the agency [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=959.48s)]
*  and take your clearance. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=962.0400000000001s)]
*  So you can either stay here or you can leave, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=963.28s)]
*  but you're not gonna take that. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=966.88s)]
*  And there was a second reason to doing it. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=968.12s)]
*  The other reason he was doing it was because [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=970.4s)]
*  he wanted to limit the competition [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=972.2s)]
*  of private intelligence firms outside of the firms [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=975.4s)]
*  that he was using. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=977.5600000000001s)]
*  Oh, so he was doing it to scratch their backs. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=978.52s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=980.12s)]
*  So he was doing it to scratch their backs. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=980.96s)]
*  Oh my God, this is next level shit. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=982.12s)]
*  And then. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=984.68s)]
*  Good reason. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=985.52s)]
*  I was ready. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=986.36s)]
*  I was like, finally. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=987.1999999999999s)]
*  He had one thing to do. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=989.0s)]
*  Okay, so he's scratching the backs of his friends. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=990.92s)]
*  His friends, allegedly, let's just say, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=992.92s)]
*  have these intelligence companies. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=994.92s)]
*  What would you call them, firms? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=996.64s)]
*  Yeah, private intelligence firms. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=997.76s)]
*  Private intelligence firms. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=998.6s)]
*  And he's, so they already have these employees [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=999.92s)]
*  that have clearance? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1003.4399999999999s)]
*  Yes, and there's also employees [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1004.84s)]
*  that don't have clearance, right? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1007.4399999999999s)]
*  But it's all about, at the end of the day, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1008.64s)]
*  I know this might shatter your trust [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1011.3199999999999s)]
*  in the federal government. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1012.88s)]
*  It's still a good old boys' network. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1015.1600000000001s)]
*  It's still, who do you know, who do you trust, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1016.0s)]
*  and who's gonna be loyal to you when people turn on you? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1018.4000000000001s)]
*  That's still very much how the government works. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1020.96s)]
*  And that's just because it's hard [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1023.32s)]
*  for the government to evolve. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1024.92s)]
*  It's not like the commercial sector [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1026.44s)]
*  that can evolve very quickly. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1027.76s)]
*  It has to. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1028.6000000000001s)]
*  You said there was a mass exodus [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1029.44s)]
*  when Trump came into office. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1030.6000000000001s)]
*  Is it the older people that are, like, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1032.88s)]
*  the older rules or the younger? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1036.04s)]
*  It's the younger generation. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1037.04s)]
*  And why? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1037.88s)]
*  They were leaving. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1038.72s)]
*  The younger generation's leaving [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1039.56s)]
*  because they're asking themselves the question. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1040.38s)]
*  What's my future? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1042.24s)]
*  And my future's in the private sector. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1043.32s)]
*  I'm out of this. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1044.9199999999998s)]
*  I can make more money. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1045.76s)]
*  I'm not gonna be able to take my clearance with me. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1046.58s)]
*  I'm gonna make no money for 30 years [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1048.72s)]
*  and then not even have the balloon when I retire [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1050.72s)]
*  of private security. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1052.8799999999999s)]
*  And what does their career look like? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1054.52s)]
*  Their career looks like serving a federal government [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1055.8799999999999s)]
*  that can't tell its ass from its elbows. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1059.36s)]
*  And don't forget, too, that from 2016 to 2020, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1061.6399999999999s)]
*  during that Trump administration, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1064.04s)]
*  he didn't trust the CIA. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1065.76s)]
*  So when he doesn't trust the CIA. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1067.52s)]
*  For good reason? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1068.84s)]
*  For mixed reasons. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1069.6799999999998s)]
*  Some were good, some were bad. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1070.76s)]
*  But keep in mind that the CIA falls under the executive. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1072.52s)]
*  What'd you say? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1075.28s)]
*  The what? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1076.1200000000001s)]
*  Got him! [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1076.96s)]
*  Got him! [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1077.8s)]
*  Well done. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1079.72s)]
*  He's my asset now. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1080.56s)]

*  Let's go, keep going. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1083.44s)]
*  That's all it is. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1084.76s)]
*  He's like a Pokemon. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1085.6000000000001s)]
*  All it is, bro. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1086.44s)]
*  You slowly get them to, what does it get on board? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1087.64s)]
*  What does it do? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1089.76s)]
*  There you go. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1090.6000000000001s)]
*  Fuck, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1091.44s)]
*  I got worn down. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1092.26s)]
*  I got worn down. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1093.1000000000001s)]
*  That's it, that's it. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1093.94s)]
*  But you keep in mind that the CIA. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1094.76s)]
*  CIA. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1096.24s)]
*  Right, CIA falls under the executive branch. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1097.08s)]
*  There's three branches of government, right? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1099.24s)]
*  The executive branch, the boss is the executive, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1101.12s)]
*  the president. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1103.44s)]
*  So when the CIA. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1104.32s)]
*  When CIA can't. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1105.52s)]
*  Isn't listening to the boss. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1106.36s)]
*  The boss doesn't fund them. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1107.94s)]
*  So when the boss says, I don't need you, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1109.86s)]
*  I'm gonna cut your funding, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1112.08s)]
*  now all of a sudden your operations get cut. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1113.04s)]
*  Everybody who's working there [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1115.1599999999999s)]
*  can't get those sexy operations that they need [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1116.52s)]
*  in order to get their promotions. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1118.5s)]
*  Now is that system. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1119.96s)]
*  This sucks. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1121.8799999999999s)]
*  Built. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1122.72s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1123.56s)]
*  Because like in 20 years time, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1124.3999999999999s)]
*  all the government agencies are gonna be shit [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1125.76s)]
*  because we're not getting any of the best young talent. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1127.52s)]
*  Think about real quick, real quick. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1130.04s)]
*  The system then is set up not to bring forth [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1131.88s)]
*  the best data and intelligence. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1136.0s)]
*  It's built to satisfy the boss. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1138.66s)]
*  And satisfying the boss might not keep America its safest. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1142.72s)]
*  Because sometimes what the boss wants to be true is not. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1146.28s)]
*  If there's an imminent threat [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1149.7s)]
*  and the boss doesn't care about it. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1150.72s)]
*  But the CIA or CIA is like, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1151.88s)]
*  yo, this is what it is and you need to fucking listen [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1154.1200000000001s)]
*  and you need to fund this. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1156.52s)]
*  This is a big problem. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1158.32s)]
*  And now the CIA fucks up [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1159.18s)]
*  when you lose the confidence of the boss. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1161.14s)]
*  So this is a huge issue. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1163.9s)]
*  It's a massive issue. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1165.38s)]
*  This is why you hear so many people, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1166.22s)]
*  every election cycle you will hear people [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1168.42s)]
*  talk about intelligence reform. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1171.18s)]
*  This is what they're talking about. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1173.3400000000001s)]
*  Question though, sorry. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1175.0600000000002s)]
*  Can you just finish that idea though? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1176.66s)]
*  The intelligence reform and what that means. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1178.3000000000002s)]
*  So intelligence reform is the idea [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1179.74s)]
*  that we need to reform the way that we do intelligence. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1181.42s)]
*  Everything from our promotions process [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1184.5s)]
*  all the way through to our sharing process [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1186.98s)]
*  to our analytical process. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1189.74s)]
*  Because what the American people trust [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1190.5800000000002s)]
*  to be a functioning, efficient vehicle, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1193.8200000000002s)]
*  we actually call on the inside, we call it a sandbox. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1198.06s)]
*  A sandbox. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1200.78s)]
*  Because when you put kids into a sandbox, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1201.7s)]
*  the most important thing [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1205.8600000000001s)]
*  is that they play nice with each other. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1206.98s)]
*  It's more important than them being creative. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1209.06s)]
*  It's more important than them doing anything else. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1210.98s)]
*  And if you guys aren't getting along, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1213.5800000000002s)]
*  then we get 9-11. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1215.54s)]
*  Right, that's right. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1217.1000000000001s)]
*  And the whole getting along thing [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1218.26s)]
*  becomes a cultural challenge. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1219.94s)]
*  Because now if you're a 27-year-old go-getter [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1222.54s)]
*  and you don't get along with the old guard, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1225.82s)]
*  then they're gonna start holding you back [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1227.82s)]
*  and then you never develop until you just punch out. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1229.86s)]
*  And that's good for them [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1232.3799999999999s)]
*  because they want more of the old guard. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1233.5s)]
*  Right, real quick. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1235.34s)]
*  On this reform, how would you reform it? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1236.18s)]
*  And this might be a longer question, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1239.1s)]
*  but how do you create a system [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1240.22s)]
*  that puts forward the most efficacious data and intelligence [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1242.3s)]
*  while at the same time doesn't alienate [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1245.54s)]
*  the boss of the organization, which is the president? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1247.46s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1250.3400000000001s)]
*  So there has to be, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1251.18s)]
*  there's checks and balances already in place. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1252.6200000000001s)]
*  That's how the federal government, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1254.94s)]
*  that's how our democracy works with checks and balances. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1255.8600000000001s)]
*  Being able to institute checks and balances [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1259.02s)]
*  where let's say you're a junior officer, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1261.06s)]
*  you make a recommendation, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1263.66s)]
*  your senior officer doesn't accept your recommendation, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1265.02s)]
*  but there is some kind of documented process [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1267.46s)]
*  that you made what you said what you said, right? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1269.46s)]
*  Then no matter how the intelligence plays out [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1272.98s)]
*  in the future, it can actually be audited back [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1275.18s)]
*  to what the junior officer said. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1278.22s)]
*  Then you end up having this thing, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1279.98s)]
*  you have an incentive for junior officers to say, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1281.8600000000001s)]
*  this is what I'm assessing. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1284.98s)]
*  And you have an incentive for senior officers [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1286.8600000000001s)]
*  to listen to them. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1288.6200000000001s)]
*  Because it's documented. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1289.94s)]
*  But what happens now instead is literally [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1292.0600000000002s)]
*  senior officers change junior officer reports. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1294.5s)]
*  So I will write a report, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1297.9s)]
*  I will send it to my middle manager, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1299.46s)]
*  my middle manager will rewrite my report [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1301.3000000000002s)]
*  with what he thinks is important on top of what I did [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1303.7s)]
*  before it goes to you. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1306.1000000000001s)]
*  And what's the justification for that? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1307.14s)]
*  Because there must be. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1308.46s)]
*  Because the idea is that the more touch points, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1309.3000000000002s)]
*  the more it will be refined by people [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1311.66s)]
*  who have more experience. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1313.18s)]
*  So they think it's refined, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1314.02s)]
*  but in reality it's a game of telephone. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1314.8600000000001s)]
*  And what happens with the game of telephone [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1316.94s)]
*  is the information changes by the time it reaches that. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1318.38s)]
*  And there's no accountability at the top. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1320.22s)]
*  And then you remember there was the divide in culture. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1321.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1323.9s)]
*  So once you get to like a senior level officer, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1324.74s)]
*  they were raised in the school of Cold War. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1327.02s)]
*  So now we're talking terrorist reports, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1329.98s)]
*  it gets passed to a middle manager [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1332.26s)]
*  who's got a little bit of terrorism experience, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1333.58s)]
*  a little bit of Cold War experience, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1335.42s)]
*  but it ends up in the hands of a senior manager [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1336.66s)]
*  who's really only cold war. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1338.3s)]
*  Can you tell us? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1339.14s)]
*  Can you tell us, in 2000 when you're getting this information, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1339.98s)]
*  we're not thinking terror's a real threat. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1341.7s)]
*  That's over there. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1343.14s)]
*  Can you tell us what's Cold War? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1343.98s)]
*  Now here's what, sorry, I need to ask this. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1344.82s)]
*  But real quick, just Cold War, what does that mean? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1345.66s)]
*  Cold War. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1347.58s)]
*  The difference between Cold War intelligence [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1348.42s)]
*  and terrorism intelligence. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1349.66s)]
*  When you remember the Soviet Union, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1351.58s)]
*  and you remember it was America versus Russia. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1353.78s)]
*  Of course. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1355.98s)]
*  That's Cold War. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1356.82s)]
*  No, no, I understand the period, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1357.66s)]
*  but like why would there be a different way [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1358.48s)]
*  of interpreting intelligence for the Cold War [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1360.14s)]
*  versus terrorism? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1362.82s)]
*  Because people weren't dying in the Cold War. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1363.66s)]
*  In the Cold War, it was cold. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1365.06s)]
*  There was no war. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1366.62s)]
*  There was no conflict. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1367.46s)]
*  So there's not an imminent threat. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1368.46s)]
*  So you're learning about, hmm, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1370.58s)]
*  gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1374.26s)]
*  Imminent threat, those are the two words. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1375.78s)]
*  Yeah, so with terrorism, we're immediately reacting, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1377.26s)]
*  or 9-11, we're immediately reacting, bomb goes off. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1379.9s)]
*  Whereas Cold War, these are nations jockeying for position [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1382.78s)]
*  via, I guess you would say, hmm. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1387.58s)]
*  Economic and military growth. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1391.5s)]
*  That's it, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1392.7s)]
*  It's economic growth. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1393.98s)]
*  Yep. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1395.1s)]
*  I guess and military growth too. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1395.94s)]
*  Ah, so you can be a little bit more relaxed [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1397.1s)]
*  during a Cold War, because you're not protecting [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1399.38s)]
*  your people in that instance. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1402.02s)]
*  We call it strategic, not relaxed. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1404.66s)]
*  You can be more strategic because things don't happen [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1406.5s)]
*  at a tactical pace. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1409.5s)]
*  It's a little more chess. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1410.46s)]
*  It's more chess. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1411.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1412.46s)]
*  Got it, okay, sorry, go. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1413.3s)]
*  My overarching question, what I'm hearing [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1414.12s)]
*  is this is very scary. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1417.46s)]
*  To me, privatizing intelligence probably will be [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1419.14s)]
*  a better solution in general, and this ties back [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1423.14s)]
*  to what we had Vivek Ramaswamy on the podcast, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1425.22s)]
*  and he basically was like, I just wanna cut [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1427.5400000000002s)]
*  a bunch of government jobs. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1429.26s)]
*  People who I think are small-government, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1430.98s)]
*  they might have distrust. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1432.66s)]
*  For me, it's just, government has no incentive [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1433.5s)]
*  to be efficient. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1435.68s)]
*  There is no profit margin, whereas a private organization, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1436.5600000000002s)]
*  we always gotta be efficient, we always gotta be the best, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1439.5s)]
*  our business is literally on the line, we will go broke. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1441.9s)]
*  I don't see a real problem, and you can tell me [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1445.0600000000002s)]
*  if I'm wrong, I don't see a real problem with, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1447.58s)]
*  let's just privatize intelligence because that's probably [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1450.22s)]
*  gonna run the most efficiently. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1453.5s)]
*  The real problem with privatizing intelligence [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1454.8s)]
*  is then you open intelligence up to marketing. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1456.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1459.1399999999999s)]
*  Marketing are promises with no meat. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1459.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1462.06s)]
*  So really what needs to happen is checks and balances, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1462.8999999999999s)]
*  like we were saying before, where there's a government [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1465.74s)]
*  held accountable for the intelligence, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1468.06s)]
*  but the highest performing bidder is the private [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1470.22s)]
*  intelligence firm. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1473.86s)]
*  Think of it like a plumber. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1474.6999999999998s)]
*  The reason you don't do the plumbing in your house, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1475.62s)]
*  I assume, is because you can send out a request [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1478.1s)]
*  to five different plumbers, you can get five different [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1480.1799999999998s)]
*  estimates, you can have them come in and make five [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1482.1799999999998s)]
*  different assessments, and the one that you trust the most [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1484.1399999999999s)]
*  is the one that you try, and if he fucks up, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1486.34s)]
*  you never hire him again. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1487.82s)]
*  That's essentially how it should work, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1489.02s)]
*  because you're the boss, it's your house, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1490.34s)]
*  so we need an intelligence organization that is federally [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1492.6599999999999s)]
*  controlled to say the quality of intelligence [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1496.04s)]
*  has to meet this standard. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1500.1799999999998s)]
*  And you think if we privatize, it becomes more about [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1501.02s)]
*  marketing than quality? [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1503.12s)]
*  If you go 100% privatized. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1504.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, look at news. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1506.02s)]
*  Like you privatize news, you're not getting the real news, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1506.9s)]
*  you're getting the most monetizable news, right? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1509.54s)]
*  And the exact same thing would happen with intelligence. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1511.6200000000001s)]
*  They're like, what does the president wanna hear? [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1513.46s)]
*  Okay, we're gonna go find it. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1515.14s)]
*  It's like- [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1516.74s)]
*  It's WMDs. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1517.58s)]
*  We're like, oh. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1518.4s)]
*  We're gonna find the WMDs. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1519.24s)]
*  It's like, there's certain news organizations that are like, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1520.08s)]
*  hey, there's some racism out there, find it. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1522.06s)]
*  I don't wanna harbor this too long, but again, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1524.18s)]
*  that is exactly what the government did. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1525.38s)]
*  The government said there's WMDs, there were no WMDs. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1526.8600000000001s)]
*  I just don't think that this is as scary as we're making it. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1529.76s)]
*  Well, now I wanna get into that point, which is, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1532.38s)]
*  how do you tell, or maybe the better question is, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1536.7800000000002s)]
*  is it possible, because this is what you always hear, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1541.98s)]
*  that there are corporations that are using the CIA [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1543.6000000000001s)]
*  almost as like a private military for their interests. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1546.66s)]
*  Is there any truth to that? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1549.7s)]
*  I wouldn't say that, so, the fact that private agencies [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1553.7s)]
*  are using CIA resources like a private army, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1557.2600000000002s)]
*  there's no direct evidence that that is what's happening. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1560.1399999999999s)]
*  Hey, I got a banana factory in Nicaragua. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1564.26s)]
*  Go start a coup, because the current administration [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1566.6999999999998s)]
*  is not letting me sell my bananas. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1569.6599999999999s)]
*  So that's not the corporation that makes that decision, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1571.1s)]
*  but that is the lobbyists who can lobby the policymakers [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1574.1s)]
*  who are federally appointed or voted in. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1577.1599999999999s)]
*  They're the ones that can then direct the CIA. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1580.24s)]
*  And they're lobbying whom? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1582.6599999999999s)]
*  They're lobbying the director that was appointed [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1584.7199999999998s)]
*  by the president, or they're lobbying the president [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1586.4399999999998s)]
*  and the congressman, and then, oh my God. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1588.86s)]
*  The president and the president's advisor panel, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1590.7s)]
*  because here's the other thing to keep in mind. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1593.3s)]
*  Presidents. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1594.82s)]
*  So the CIA is getting all this shit, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1595.6599999999999s)]
*  and they're just doing what they're told. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1597.24s)]
*  So it's really the politicians [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1599.46s)]
*  that should be getting the shit. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1600.9199999999998s)]
*  I thought the CIA was acting on their own. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1602.5s)]
*  Well, they did in certain circumstances. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1605.5s)]
*  Pre-911, pre-911, they had a lot more autonomy [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1607.54s)]
*  than they do now, because the 911 commission came out [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1610.74s)]
*  and said, you guys have way too much autonomy. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1613.3s)]
*  So going back to your whole point about, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1615.1399999999999s)]
*  did they shoot JFK? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1616.94s)]
*  Nobody really knows, nobody really knows, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1618.14s)]
*  because they had so much autonomy. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1620.18s)]
*  You fucking know, dude. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1621.74s)]
*  Did they do it or what? [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1623.14s)]
*  If I knew, I would be a lot richer than I am right now. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1623.98s)]
*  Why, what would you do with that information [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1626.74s)]
*  to make so much money? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1629.46s)]
*  I would find a way to prove it, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1630.3000000000002s)]
*  and I'd be the first person to ever expose the truth [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1632.02s)]
*  with the proof. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1634.74s)]
*  What about Abraham Lincoln? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1635.8200000000002s)]
*  Another president that got shot, you got a thing for this. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1639.8600000000001s)]
*  C Marion. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1643.22s)]
*  I only knew one so slow that I was going to kill him, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1646.22s)]
*  because I never really watched a once in a lifetime [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1648.5400000000002s)]
*  man, зн 잡rey, and Dane and Nguyen, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1650.98s)]
*  and I found lukewarm shots. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1653.78s)]
*  It sounds, I don't know what this is, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1656.0400000000002s)]
*  maybe [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1658.14s)]
*  them cops. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1670.24s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't have gaydar. Yeah, we need that they have gaydar because they're recruiting for gay right now [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1671.2s)]
*  What does that mean there they want to diversify into? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1676.5s)]
*  LGBTQ plus all the various they want that kind of diversity because the government is trying to bring back young people and [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1680.02s)]
*  Because they lost all their young people from like to yeah young people [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1687.06s)]
*  Get it. Yeah young people are gay, but now isn't there an advantage in having some gay [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1690.26s)]
*  Operatives because the Middle East exactly. Yeah [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1695.54s)]
*  No for real you can see that [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1698.8600000000001s)]
*  I [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1701.2s)]
*  Turns out we can't fly it's a good experiment [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1706.38s)]
*  No, no, but maybe you could use them as I know that you say that in the CIA [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1709.1000000000001s)]
*  You guys don't use the honeypot thing [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1712.54s)]
*  But like that would be advantageous you go to the Middle East you you're like hey like I'm kind of half gay [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1714.26s)]
*  And if there is some check out there that is a little bit gay [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1719.14s)]
*  He might feel a little bit more safe getting his cheeks rinsed by and you know a guy who's not from there [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1721.72s)]
*  He's not gonna tell anybody right so here's here's the he's an asset. Here's the interesting [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1726.52s)]
*  Here's the interesting thing that people don't understand about CIA. Yeah, see I has always been one of the most diverse workforces in [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1730.54s)]
*  Need to always getting intelligence from out there that helped you get hired correct. I'm a brown dude [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1737.6s)]
*  Yeah, you're you could be you're actually good. I'm [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1743.5s)]
*  Ambiguously brown. Yeah, so nobody knows where I'm from. I mean I I did not have good grades in college [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1747.1s)]
*  I was I was a bad officer in the Air Force like I am NOT your Ivy League [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1752.72s)]
*  White guy that was pre 9-eleven you know [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1757.44s)]
*  And and that's just me I mean there are there are thousands of people that were recruited with me [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1760.88s)]
*  Diverse in every possible way the thing was it wasn't front and center CIA recruitment marketing that you have to be diverse [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1765.68s)]
*  Right so what ended up happening was they would find people the way they find people they would run them through a [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1773.5600000000002s)]
*  psychological profiling as part of your recruitment, and then they would find out like oh [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1780.1200000000001s)]
*  You're gay or you're straight or you're this or that or whatever else right you believe in in two gods or whatever might be [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1784.48s)]
*  But they would run you through a profile and the profile would tell them [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1790.68s)]
*  That you're crazy in a spurt in a specific kind of way. That's very useful for collecting intelligence like for example [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1794.6000000000001s)]
*  So the you the reason I'm here today is because you were referencing something I mentioned once about [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1801.92s)]
*  Psychological high-performance trauma. Mm-hmm, right people who have a certain amount of trauma when they're kids [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1808.64s)]
*  Become high performers later in life. Mm-hmm that what that's really saying is that we're a little bit crazy [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1813.56s)]
*  But we're crazy in a useful way versus a person who has so much trauma that they end up being like [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1819.28s)]
*  rated sex or whatever [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1825.4s)]
*  Even that's still useful crazy [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1828.24s)]
*  But I'm talking about the kind of crazy that ends up with somebody shooting to people like somebody who goes in and starts shooting up a grocery [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1831.08s)]
*  Store somebody who that's too much crazy. So they're trying to find the right amount of crazy, right? [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1836.76s)]
*  Okay, and when you and that's useful so it used to be that they could bring in people who looked normal [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1840.6s)]
*  Right who looked like they blended in and then find the ones that were useful crazy now [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1846.6799999999998s)]
*  They're basically advertising like hey, we want you if who's gay. Yeah [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1850.9599999999998s)]
*  Are you are they are they going? Hey if you're gay you had enough trauma in your life that you might be crazy enough to be [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1856.84s)]
*  In the CIA. I mean, that's maybe that's the sure that might be part of their strategy [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1861.9599999999998s)]
*  But if you if you see them, they are openly advertising to [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1865.26s)]
*  Diverse group I would assume that is the world is more openly you're more comfortable being openly gay openly whatever so [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1868.96s)]
*  That person will fit in better with those groups whereas before in the 50s [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1875.72s)]
*  Maybe being gay was something you probably hid from in the 90s man. We hit from yes, but then there's also don't forget [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1878.98s)]
*  It's a federal organization. So guess what federal organizations have to mandate [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1884.0800000000002s)]
*  diversity [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1888.44s)]
*  So you have to have this many women you have to have this many gay people you have to have this many people who identify [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1889.96s)]
*  as females but are actually [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1895.3200000000002s)]
*  Have male sex organs and you have to like there's all these government regulations, especially in a [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1898.16s)]
*  democratically controlled executive right that whenever you they dictate the requirements to see a [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1904.52s)]
*  Okay thing or bad thing for CIA. What do you think? I think it's a horrible thing for CIA [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1910.2s)]
*  I mean let let CIA hire what they need to hire to execute the operations [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1913.88s)]
*  They need to execute for the threat of the day. Mm-hmm, right because the threat of the day changes [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1919.3000000000002s)]
*  Okay, you I want to get back to this second but you met your wife on the job, correct [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1924.2800000000002s)]
*  How hard is it to sleep with a CIA operative? [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1930.92s)]
*  I mean are you talking about how to actually sleep with the CIA operative or like when we say sleep with the same? [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1934.18s)]
*  No, I mean like she sees all your fucking tricks. Yeah, she's trained in the exact same way that makes it really easy [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1939.5600000000002s)]
*  What that makes it super easy because? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1945.8000000000002s)]
*  The hardest thing to do is lie and hide [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1948.4s)]
*  So that's what I think about how much effort we all put into that in my marriage that efforts gone [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1950.6000000000001s)]
*  There's no reason to even try and even worse than that is my wife can read my body language [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1955.0s)]
*  So she knows when you're lying. So she knows when I'm uncomfortable. She knows when I'm sad [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1960.68s)]
*  She knows I'm stressed out like she actually knows it because she can actually read it [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1963.92s)]
*  So it makes the fact that I'm like an open book to her super super easy [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1967.1200000000001s)]
*  And the fact that she's open book to me is no CIA marriages tend to last longer [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1971.24s)]
*  They last until the job starts to interfere with the marriage [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1975.64s)]
*  CIA has one of the highest divorce rates in all federal government [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1980.52s)]
*  Because when CIA officer when they marry each other they reach that point in their career where it's like are you gonna choose? [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1984.24s)]
*  Career or marriage and that usually for those people they choose career [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1990.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and then if you're a CIA officer who marries a non CIA officer [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1993.92s)]
*  Oh, you still reach the point in your career where it's like why are you working all the time? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=1997.3600000000001s)]
*  I can't really tell you and then oh what you guys could share what you were doing with each other or were their limitations [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2000.8400000000001s)]
*  so my wife and I had the benefit of [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2006.72s)]
*  Meeting and marrying each other when we were in different offices [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2009.76s)]
*  But then there was a change in operational priorities that actually put us into a tandem [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2012.32s)]
*  That's why we operated together wait you guys were partners on the job [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2017.1599999999999s)]
*  So you were pretending to be married and married we didn't even have to pretend we just actually were married [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2020.6s)]
*  But you were using pseudonyms. I assume we were using a a structure of cover legend [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2026.6s)]
*  Yeah, that was more robust because we had actual documentation behind it [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2032.76s)]
*  Who's the easiest race to trick? [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2038.96s)]
*  Who is the easiest race to trick so if you're talking about ethnic race, yeah [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2052.72s)]
*  So ethnic races, it's really difficult because it's based on education [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2058.2s)]
*  But when it comes to race as a subcontext of nationalistic like pride, yeah, it's Americans [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2062.52s)]
*  We're the easiest ones to trick. We're the most ignorant culture in the world [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2068.92s)]
*  We're the best for announce Edmonton Canada July 12th [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2082.68s)]

*  How do you get this kind of wisdom so CIA trains through a method called just-in-time learning [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2200.66s)]
*  Also known as experiential training or experiential learning. So they'll teach you a concept [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2206.1s)]
*  Academically, you'll learn a concept [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2211.54s)]
*  Slideshow or classroom or whatever else and then you'll go out and you'll practice that concept in a scenario [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2213.42s)]
*  So in it with an actor with a role, okay [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2218.9s)]
*  You're not just going to a coffee shop and doing it and then once you have shown that you understand the concept in a role-play [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2221.54s)]
*  You're in the real world doing it and that's how you cement a skill before you come back [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2227.54s)]
*  How much of these actors fucking with you in these like how? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2233.1s)]
*  Yeah, so do they even know oh, yeah, but the actors blind in it [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2236.18s)]
*  They're they're not they're not actors like you're thinking of actors [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2239.46s)]
*  They're role players meaning they are CIA officers who have already been through the ringer and now they're helping to train the next generation [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2241.98s)]
*  Is this at the farm? So correct the farmers is our training academy and there are multiple schools that we have the farm is the most famous [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2248.34s)]
*  But that's where we go through that's the most practical real-world example of our full experiential learning style [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2255.46s)]
*  Could you give us a could you give us an example of one of these exercises? Sure. So there's a [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2261.38s)]
*  One of my favorite exercises is a free cup of coffee exercise. So you have to get a free cup of coffee, huh? [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2267.1000000000004s)]
*  But there's certain stipulations you can't ask for a free cup of coffee [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2274.02s)]
*  You can't trade somebody for a free cup of coffee [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2278.1400000000003s)]
*  So but you have to get a free cup of coffee, can you be a woman many of them are born that way [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2281.66s)]
*  So what you have to do is they will teach you like here's how you create [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2291.54s)]
*  reciprocity and here's how you create interest and here's how you create value for somebody in excess of what a cup of coffee costs and [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2295.98s)]
*  Then here's how you put yourself in a position with somebody where they connect on their own through some kind of [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2302.22s)]
*  What was the movie with Leonardo DiCaprio [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2309.3399999999997s)]
*  Inception yeah, the is the essentially real-world version of inception is called neuro linguistic programming or something like that [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2311.66s)]
*  Some people call it but you're basically planting an idea you're priming an idea [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2317.46s)]
*  Yeah, so here's how you prime someone for an idea where they are like, I just had a great conversation with you [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2320.54s)]
*  I want to buy you a cup of coffee. Oh, what a fascinating way to break down human behavior [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2325.4199999999996s)]
*  If I want a free cup of coffee, I give him value [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2329.7799999999997s)]
*  Emotionally that is worth more than a free cup of coffee intellectually [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2332.58s)]
*  You give me value in the way that I care most about value and then leave a gap where they can fill it now [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2335.06s)]
*  Now the cup of coffee you're getting from a stranger not from the person at the coffee shop. Mm-hmm, correct [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2339.36s)]
*  Okay, I thought you have to charm the barista. You can if you if you don't if you find yourself [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2345.98s)]
*  Selecting a coffee shop where you don't have other people in line. Okay being in line with somebody as benefit because you got what we call [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2352.42s)]
*  time on target [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2358.0s)]
*  But when you go up to a barista, how long is a barista used to dealing with a customer? [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2359.5s)]
*  12 seconds, how are you gonna create value into oh, wow [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2363.06s)]
*  Okay, biggest farm is it like Westworld where it's just like hundreds of people like just living [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2365.58s)]
*  Essentially, it's a base. The farm is a giant retired military base [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2372.2599999999998s)]
*  Instructors live there students live there [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2377.58s)]
*  Contract personnel stay there for long deployments like it's a self-contained place [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2380.5s)]
*  And they have total control over your entire student experience there [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2385.54s)]
*  Which is how you can go through this kind of coffee shop is an actual coffee shop [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2389.2s)]
*  Outside outside like in the movie the recruit like you have to go and get a get someone from the bar and get them out [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2392.8399999999997s)]
*  What's the uh, have you ever had like a really awkward exchange when you're trying to practice something that you learned? [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2398.4399999999996s)]
*  Yes, we would call it in comedy bombing [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2404.9199999999996s)]
*  Okay, tell me about a bomb bombed a lot of okay. Well, hopefully not real [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2409.12s)]
*  Yeah, you can't say that [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2413.16s)]
*  No, but yeah, so I mean [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2417.44s)]
*  I've bombed at in in the real world like with this coffee example [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2419.52s)]
*  It took me six attempts before I got a free cup of coffee and what happens the first attempt? [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2423.84s)]
*  What do you so I think the first time I went there I tried to talk to a barista [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2429.16s)]
*  Okay, and I try to just show up and be like hey, I've got this thing [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2432.44s)]
*  I went looking for like a wallet like oh, I don't know where my wallet is and she was like [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2435.16s)]
*  Well, I can't give you can you come she tried to guilt her. Yeah, I was just trying to be like [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2438.0s)]
*  It's not very effective. It's not part of the training. I hadn't internalized the concept yet [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2442.36s)]
*  Right [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2446.2s)]
*  So then I went another time and I was like with a with a dude and trying to talk to a dude about stuff that I was [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2446.56s)]
*  Not connecting with what he cared about. I was telling him about how cool I am. Okay, how'd you open up to him? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2452.2400000000002s)]
*  What was the first line? This is this is awesome. What cup of coffee you're gonna get? [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2457.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't remember the details right, but it's basically something along the line. Like hey, what are you gonna get? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2460.88s)]
*  He's like, oh, I was gonna get an Americano and I was like, oh a latte is the best [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2464.2s)]
*  You started talking about you. Yeah, you were more interesting than interested [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2467.52s)]
*  Why yeah, yeah, why do you we have why do you want an Americano? What is it doesn't it doesn't matter [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2470.6s)]
*  What matters is that the concept is fail because what I'm saying is if you asked him why he likes Americano [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2475.24s)]
*  You're tapping into what he's feeling you seem like the kind of guy that has lattes and be like, oh, what does that mean? [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2480.7s)]
*  Like you're giving him something correct. Yeah, what what you learn from bombing? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2485.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, is you learn how other people actually think and how they engage with the communication that you're sharing you guys know [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2490.68s)]
*  More than anybody right? Yeah, because when you start to engage with somebody about what they're interested in [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2497.84s)]
*  Mm-hmm. Now all of a sudden they don't see you as a threat or an outsider. They see you as like a friend [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2502.84s)]
*  Yeah, you make me feel good about me. Yes, you're asking me questions about me. I like you [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2508.2400000000002s)]
*  Yes, right you I trust you because you're saying things about me that that I also believe and that's how you get to a place [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2512.52s)]
*  Where after six minutes in line and you get up to the front of the line? [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2519.84s)]
*  They're like, can I buy you a cup of coffee? Do you remember the moment that you were asked? Absolutely. Okay, what happened? [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2523.08s)]
*  How'd you do that? So it was a it was a much older lady. It was like a lady in her 50 you son of a [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2528.52s)]
*  Okay, we had been in line just whipped it out you seem one of these lately [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2535.96s)]
*  It was a much older lady and [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2548.44s)]
*  We were in line it became very clear to me that she [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2550.48s)]
*  Liked to talk but nobody would talk to her [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2554.28s)]
*  So then I just kind of sat there and let her talk and everything that she brought up her grandkids her kids her cats [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2556.6s)]
*  Her job. I just asked a follow-up question. I was like, oh, that's interesting. That's I mean [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2562.94s)]
*  How did your kids feel about when you retired from accounting or how did your you know? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2567.6s)]
*  How do you take care of three cats? [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2571.36s)]
*  Do you feed them canned food or do you feed them food that you make for them themselves? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2572.44s)]
*  It was just this natural conversation natural from her point of view [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2575.56s)]
*  Where I was just being nice to her and learning about her gave her a conversation [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2579.28s)]
*  Which she doesn't get because most people don't want to listen to a 55 year old woman talk [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2583.12s)]
*  Yeah, right and then by the time we got to the actual checkout at the register [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2586.16s)]
*  She was gonna pay with a credit card anyways, so she was just like you can put his coffee on mine [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2589.96s)]
*  That's now and the hardest part [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2593.56s)]
*  Yeah [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2595.84s)]
*  Is all you want to do is fucking celebrate and get the hell out of the coffee shop and go back and be like [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2596.28s)]
*  Here's my free cup of coffee. You gotta say no. No, no, please don't do it [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2600.98s)]
*  Say oh that was very nice of you and then you sit down and you have another two or three minutes of coffee with her [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2606.12s)]
*  Because you've got to find an exit that is [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2611.08s)]
*  Positive and amicable now now now now, okay you you get this success you get this positive reward, right? [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2614.32s)]
*  Like you said you want to just run back to the office and be like, yo [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2621.52s)]
*  I did it is there is that ever met with a sense of guilt as I [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2624.28s)]
*  Potentially manipulated another human being this so I love that you're asking this question [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2629.96s)]
*  I love it. You're asking this question because [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2635.48s)]
*  To get to the place where you're going through that level of training. You've already been psychologically assessed [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2638.12s)]
*  in a realm of [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2643.76s)]
*  Antisocial behavior. Hmm that makes it so that you know and the people who are training [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2647.16s)]
*  You know that you're not really wired to feel good [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2652.52s)]
*  About so manipulating others my follow-up to that is this before you came here [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2656.56s)]
*  I was ready to ask you a bunch of I don't want to even call them hard questions [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2661.24s)]
*  But I had less empathy for you now that we've spoken a bit and I like you [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2665.3999999999996s)]
*  I have a little bit more empathy [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2669.96s)]
*  so I'm like [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2671.7599999999998s)]
*  do I really want to ask him a question that he might get in trouble for answering by the CIA and I'm starting to feel [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2672.4399999999996s)]
*  these sensations and I know the thing that [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2678.48s)]
*  Would make me feel that guilt [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2682.24s)]
*  Is also the thing that I'm curious about [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2685.64s)]
*  But you've charmed me I guess or maybe I enjoy talking to you or arguing with you about Europeans being stupid [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2687.92s)]
*  Which is what we both agree ultimately, but I guess what I'm saying is that that would be horrible for the CIA [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2694.64s)]
*  I'll be because I feel too bad. I get operative. Yeah [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2700.92s)]
*  He just said it right bad field. You also can't keep a secret ever. Yeah, I'm not good at that [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2704.92s)]
*  Yeah, so that I mean there's a couple of things there, right? [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2709.16s)]
*  So I'm already part of the CIA and I'm tricking all of you and that's even better this information [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2710.8399999999997s)]
*  So so the thing to keep in mind here is that is that [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2714.7999999999997s)]
*  There's an element of predictable behavior that's wired into us cognitively [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2719.48s)]
*  From childhood, right? [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2724.64s)]
*  So especially people who have had experiences with significant trauma as children also have a higher likelihood of developing antisocial [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2726.3599999999997s)]
*  disorders or antisocial [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2733.08s)]
*  Conditions as adults because as children we tried to fit in and we were rejected [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2735.6s)]
*  So now as adults we're like fuck trying to fit in [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2740.7599999999998s)]
*  But maybe I should still try to fit in because it's just easier if people think I fit in right [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2743.2s)]
*  So there's there's an element of that. Do you feel that way about yourself? Oh, yeah, absolutely [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2747.9199999999996s)]
*  Well for me, I'm nice cuz I'm like I'm like credible at socializing. It's all but it's all you think it's manufactured [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2751.56s)]
*  It's all kind of learned. No, it's it's real [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2757.72s)]
*  But the difference is what happens on the back end if you will right like having a conversation [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2760.3799999999997s)]
*  Like you were saying you feel guilty asking me questions [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2765.16s)]
*  I wouldn't feel guilty asking you questions because I've been conditioned through my childhood trauma to be kind of safe of feeling like I'm gonna [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2767.32s)]
*  Ask you a question your responsibility if you answer or not [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2773.84s)]
*  I was literally talking to my wife about this the other day because my wife is also former CIA [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2776.2400000000002s)]
*  so we have some very dark conversations and and the question was if if you were crossing a street and [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2779.84s)]
*  You were crossing a street at a time when you needed to cross the street to get away from some creepy dude who was standing [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2787.48s)]
*  At the street corner [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2792.88s)]
*  But when you cross the street you made another car swerve because you crossed when it wasn't crosswalk and that car crashed [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2793.64s)]
*  Right, so you just saved yourself from creepy dude who's standing at the edge of sidewalk, but that car crashed. Do you feel bad? [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2799.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean my answer is no [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2807.52s)]
*  No, I don't feel bad to do like well [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2810.16s)]
*  I don't feel bad because I [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2812.92s)]
*  Self-preserved got myself off the X was a term that we say getting off the X the dude that crashed [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2814.3199999999997s)]
*  Wasn't driving responsibly or else he wouldn't have crashed and it wasn't your attention [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2819.6s)]
*  And it wasn't my intention, you know, it was crazy coincidence. Maybe not [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2822.76s)]
*  I grew up in Dallas born and raised the spot where JFK is killed. You know how it's marked on the road [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2826.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's an X on the road. Yeah, there's an X on the road. So off the X really makes me think you guys killed JFK [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2832.2400000000002s)]
*  Now you're you've studied people enough to know that like this guilt response is quite normal [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2845.84s)]
*  Right right in a socially conditioned person and you're saying you just feel none of it. I don't feel none of it [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2852.52s)]
*  I just it's it doesn't hold me back. All right, so you feel it, but it doesn't stop you gotcha [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2859.16s)]
*  Where is like a sociopath for example might not feel it at all [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2863.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh, so you're in a really advantageous situation because you could act on that feeling if you think it's the socially responsible thing to do [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2866.52s)]
*  But if you need to get where you need to go you won't I act on the feeling when it is a [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2873.08s)]
*  Personal benefit and that's the difference between a true sociopath which is a good member every time about [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2879.76s)]
*  Antisocial disorders. Yep, a true sociopath is actually clinically called [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2887.0800000000004s)]
*  Antisocial disorder antisocial personality disorder ASPD [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2892.28s)]
*  Okay, so that's a clinical thing just like a psychopath is a clinical thing on the antisocial personality disorder spectrum [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2896.1200000000003s)]
*  Whereas where what I'm talking about is useful [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2903.1200000000003s)]
*  elements of [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2905.98s)]
*  of [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2908.5s)]
*  Sociopathy. Yeah, but still able to fit into a larger system. My cousin's like actress [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2909.8599999999997s)]
*  He always distinguishes between sociopath and having sociopathic tendencies and he's like there's a lot of really successful people have sociopathic tendencies [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2914.58s)]
*  What advantage sociopath would make a bad agent correct because a true sociopath would be empathy [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2921.66s)]
*  Right a true social to connect now follow a question someone really get the coffee [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2926.92s)]
*  Someone related everybody mental health is huge in every job on in the CIA or they're like, no, you're not doing no fucking therapy [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2931.58s)]
*  We're not paying for anything. I don't want you to work on this part of you or is there very specific therapy? [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2938.1s)]
*  How does that work? It's an abundance of therapy options because of exactly that reason [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2942.5s)]
*  So to your point about how some very high performing people have sociopathic tendencies. What else do very high performing people have? [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2947.8599999999997s)]
*  incredible vices [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2954.8599999999997s)]
*  substance abuse sex [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2957.2599999999998s)]
*  Right pathological lying. They really gotta find the right operative. Wow. This is a fascinating case study [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2959.9s)]
*  You need to find someone fucked up enough where they don't feel the guilt so they can go out there and do things that do induce [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2966.3s)]
*  Guilt on the average person but not so fucked up that they're gonna be doing cocaine fucking girls non-stop [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2972.5800000000004s)]
*  To get over the guilt or to cope with these feelings that you have [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2979.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean that is a small window and still have some level of remorse because the truth sociopath again not a good agent [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2982.5800000000004s)]
*  You therapy can you see a regular therapist or it has to be another CIA? [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2989.26s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2993.3s)]
*  It's a CIA therapist and then if you have a if you have conditions that are too significant or too severe for us for a staff [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=2993.94s)]
*  Psychologist then they have a group of cleared psychologists. Do they test prospects on their vices? Yes. Oh great question [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3000.1400000000003s)]
*  How do I do it? They well, there's two parts first [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3006.78s)]
*  There's a psychological battery that they put you through like an actual psychological exam and then from that they're able to [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3009.1800000000003s)]
*  Assess this is what we see in the movies or TV shows where like they're asking you difficult questions [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3016.62s)]
*  It's it's it's not the answer but how you react. That's a part of it [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3021.02s)]
*  Can you give us an example of do you remember anything you were asked? Yeah. Yeah [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3024.58s)]
*  So well, I don't remember the questions in the in the actual exam, right? [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3027.2999999999997s)]
*  But I remember there are questions in the exam where they're they're giving you questions and they're giving you answers and there's no good answer [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3032.2999999999997s)]
*  Like there's no safe answer right? Like have you ever I remember this one [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3037.9399999999996s)]
*  Have you ever participated in sexual deviancy [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3043.2599999999998s)]
*  Like that that's a subjective like yes or no, yeah [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3047.5s)]
*  And I'm in like the last stages of applying for the CIA [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3051.62s)]
*  Is this the question that's gonna get me kicked out all this pressure starts to build up. So what did I answer? Yep [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3055.22s)]
*  Right better to say yes than to say no and then they find out you're gonna find out that I'm lying [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3061.7799999999997s)]
*  So I'm just gonna say yes and hope for the best, right? [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3066.2999999999997s)]
*  Now I was also able to say no to ever using any kind of controlled substance because I have never and still to this day [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3069.34s)]
*  Even though I dream of the day that I get to use some kind of controlled substance, right? [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3075.7s)]
*  So there are certain places where I get to answer yes and no throughout that whole exam and then after the exam [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3080.22s)]
*  I had an in-person interview with a psychologist who was going through the exam results and that [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3085.18s)]
*  Psychologist was like can you please share with me your sexual deviancy? [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3090.5s)]
*  And I am that part is even more important than what you actually put on the paper [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3094.14s)]
*  I don't know because I'm not I I never got the insight into how they recruited us exactly [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3097.1s)]
*  But now you're sitting here face to face with somebody and the one question that spiked you during the exam [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3101.5s)]
*  They're asking you to your face. And again, you're like, I'm not much closer to being a CIA officer [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3106.46s)]
*  So then you're like, well, I've always wanted to do this and I did this and I've tried this and I've tried that [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3110.7599999999998s)]
*  And then at the end for me the dude was like none of that's deviancy. Yeah, like oh sweet [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3114.98s)]
*  So like two girls at once and sex parties none of that's deviancy. He's like no [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3120.34s)]
*  How can you trust the intentions of the psychology [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3125.1s)]
*  Yeah [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3129.18s)]
*  You have to trust that the intentions of the psychologist are to get enough people through the pipeline [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3129.2599999999998s)]
*  That they don't look like they're too harsh or too easy in their exam [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3134.74s)]
*  No, I'm talking about when you're already hired [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3138.08s)]
*  You're part of the CIA and you are seeking mental help. I would imagine that the CIA is looking out for its interests [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3140.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so how and yes only speak to their therapists [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3147.3399999999997s)]
*  How can you fully open up to somebody if you know that you're being assessed? [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3150.94s)]
*  So you've got this is such a powerful question man, because this is the crux of why I left CIA [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3154.62s)]
*  I left CIA when I was 34 years old. I'm 43 now. You're 40 now, right? Yeah when you're in your mid-30s [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3159.6s)]
*  Whatever you're doing. You're all in. Yeah, you're all in [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3168.42s)]
*  Yep [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3171.54s)]
*  If you've got producers producing you if you got supervising supervising you if you've got whatever you're like everybody is in this together [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3171.8599999999997s)]
*  When they're all actually in it for self-preservation [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3178.0s)]
*  So as a mid 30 year old [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3181.12s)]
*  It took the birth of my first child before I was like I asked myself that exact question [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3183.4799999999996s)]
*  It's like oh shit [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3188.3599999999997s)]
*  Why do I think that this person's out for my best interest when they're just out for their own career and and I started to see [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3189.52s)]
*  That the process we were trained to get a foreigner to betray their country to give us secrets that same process [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3195.2799999999997s)]
*  Was our professional development process [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3201.9599999999996s)]
*  But you knew this at an early age [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3205.4799999999996s)]
*  I know why I knew this at 34 only because of the birth of my son, but you knew it before [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3207.0s)]
*  I mean you're assessing people all the time, right? [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3211.0s)]
*  But you're assessing people through a state of conditioning where you've been brainwashed to believe [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3213.64s)]
*  You're the best of the best of the best. Wow, you believe their propaganda says correct [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3217.36s)]
*  You really you didn't see it at all. There was no signs of it [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3222.52s)]
*  We were like, I'm a little skeptical the signs are in hindsight, right? [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3225.64s)]
*  Cuz if you give me a sign and you're in it. Yeah, when you're in it, you're in it [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3229.48s)]
*  So a sign of a sign is like [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3233.2799999999997s)]
*  When you're in it, for example when you're in it people are always promising you the next best assignment, right? [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3235.4799999999996s)]
*  Oh, we need a carrot constant carrots, right? We need you to go here. We need you to go there [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3241.3599999999997s)]
*  Oh that dried up with that dried up and you're the person and you're always going you're like, I'm gonna take it [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3245.3199999999997s)]
*  There were a lot of intelligent Nazis that thought they were the good guys [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3249.12s)]
*  But like there are good people that are doing things that are outside of what you could say are their interest or objectively true [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3252.8799999999997s)]
*  They bought it so [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3259.48s)]
*  Enforcement and there were times where it's just like ah, this is just chain of command [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3261.08s)]
*  This is just the way things are and wasn't till you're outside of it where he's like [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3263.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's a little fucked up [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3268.0s)]
*  So if you have people that are extremely motivated by reward [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3269.2799999999997s)]
*  You can just throw a carrot in front of them and they won't ask questions about anything else [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3273.56s)]
*  If they're extremely if they're driven by reward, yes, however, what if if there's four core motivations [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3278.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm sure that's kind of what you're referencing right now that CIA teaches us [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3284.96s)]
*  What is it the reward? [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3287.7599999999998s)]
*  Ideology coercion and ego, right? We call it rice reward ideology coercion and ego for main reasons. We all do anything. Yeah [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3289.96s)]
*  Reward is a strong one, but it's not the strongest ideology [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3298.4s)]
*  So what you do is you recruit these people who are borderline sociopaths and you have a credible amount of loyalty [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3302.44s)]
*  And then you tell them America has to be the safest. You're here to keep the homeland safe [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3308.3199999999997s)]
*  You're the future of our country [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3313.3199999999997s)]
*  Children your parents everyone is gonna be safer because of your humble servant [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3315.84s)]
*  You're the best. Is that how I said responsibility same same same. It's slightly different [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3320.2s)]
*  What what I said ideology what ISIS does is they use something called a radicalization ladder because they're trying to create radicals [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3325.96s)]
*  Yeah, what CIA is doing is creating practicals [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3332.36s)]
*  Right. Yeah [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3336.04s)]
*  But yeah and careerists careerists don't end their career by strapping a bomb to their chest [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3338.36s)]
*  But that's how a radical what is your greatest motivation you think? [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3342.84s)]
*  So for me, my greatest motivation is ideological [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3346.56s)]
*  But my ideology changed when you had that baby didn't it everything changed, you know this man. It just happened to you, too [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3349.08s)]
*  Yep, everything changes when that makes that make sense. So now your ideology is I'm a family man [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3354.48s)]
*  I'm a father before that my ideology was always I'm protecting America safe. Yeah now it's keep my baby safe [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3359.0s)]
*  It is and is it a liability? [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3364.8s)]
*  To let operatives to let [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3367.8s)]
*  operatives have families that this becomes a big part of the challenge in any [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3370.6800000000003s)]
*  CIA officers mid-career when you start having children or [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3377.2400000000002s)]
*  When your children are in that age where they're the magic age like you're not in the magic age [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3381.2400000000002s)]
*  You're still in like the huddle of of the human [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3385.1400000000003s)]
*  But once like once you start tickling your baby and it's over [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3392.1600000000003s)]
*  Fuck it's over. You're corruptible. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, what's that happen? You said that? [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3396.04s)]
*  Once that happens everything really does change and then you start to see I have to protect this baby and then you also ask yourself [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3403.2s)]
*  Oh shit the stuff I do if somebody really wants to fuck with me, they're gonna fuck with this [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3409.4s)]
*  Oh fuck, and then it just kids and then it just gets worse. Okay, and that's that's a big part of what contributes to [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3415.12s)]
*  People in their mid-career [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3422.2000000000003s)]
*  Making different choices in their mid-career why they stop competing to be at the top of the food chain and they're starting to be happy [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3423.96s)]
*  With being middle managers because middle managers get forgotten get overlooked. I can stay home most of the time [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3429.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm never gonna be like in the cutting edge of stuff [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3434.08s)]
*  Okay, does the CIA once they find out that you're about to have a family or even before that maybe when you get married [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3437.12s)]
*  They know what's coming next. Do they start adding? [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3443.68s)]
*  Protecting your children to the ideology of what you're doing at work [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3447.28s)]
*  so [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3452.48s)]
*  As an effort to maintain right? I wouldn't say they manipulate it that way what ends up happening is you've got it culturally [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3453.84s)]
*  Your supervisor is older than you right physically. They're older than you and they're a supervisor which means they've been there longer [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3461.04s)]
*  so they've already made the [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3467.2400000000002s)]
*  Compromises to stay in their career. So then that person starts to feed their compromises on to you [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3471.4s)]
*  The person who chooses family over career has already left never so they're not even there. So there's nobody to even look towards [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3476.4s)]
*  Yeah, so everybody within the institution. Hey, this is what it is. This is what you do [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3484.08s)]
*  How did you see status quo same thing when you were in law enforcement, right? [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3488.08s)]
*  Man admits that is quote. This is the way it is just don't ruffle. So it's very important that those people in those positions are [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3490.92s)]
*  Enjoying their life because if they're not [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3499.08s)]
*  You're looking at what your life is gonna be and you're going I gotta get the fuck out out of here [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3502.12s)]
*  Well, it's it's not important that they are enjoying their life as much as it's important that they are doubling down on the ideology [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3506.44s)]
*  That keeps them there or they're committed in other words if they're starting to fray in their commitment [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3511.7999999999997s)]
*  Everything else trickles down. Oh, that's scary [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3515.8799999999997s)]
*  The number one thing that you're looking for in any kind of government service is the idea of service before self [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3518.56s)]
*  Anybody watching this anybody listening to this whose military law enforcement first responder government? [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3525.08s)]
*  We all agree like it's it's indoctrinated into you from the day one service comes before yourself. And what makes somebody? [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3530.98s)]
*  What is the character buildup or personality trait buildup to have service before self? It's just a matter of commitment [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3537.1s)]
*  like you said, it's the it's understanding that your discomfort and your opinions and your [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3543.06s)]
*  Anything that makes you unhappy is less important than servicing the mission [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3548.98s)]
*  But is there a trauma that you go through that would induce this personality type? [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3553.2000000000003s)]
*  Is there something that happens in your life where you can predict this sort of yes [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3556.26s)]
*  So when we go back to that whole idea of childhood trauma what the the outcome of childhood trauma is that you need an invisible? [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3559.74s)]
*  Authority to approve [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3566.54s)]
*  And as long as and the challenge for us all is growing up in that world [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3569.54s)]
*  You never know who that invisible authority is. So you're always seeking it. It's like I got to get good grades [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3573.62s)]
*  Somebody say it's good. All right, I got to do good on. Yeah, I could go on stage and yeah [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3577.4599999999996s)]
*  I got to do good. Yeah [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3581.66s)]
*  Yeah [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3582.74s)]
*  Yeah [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3583.02s)]
*  When when you get into a government job and you have that same conditioning the difference now is you know exactly what you have to do to do a good job [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3583.18s)]
*  To get that authority to approve of you. All you have to do is say yes to the next mission [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3590.74s)]
*  It does no guessing anymore. Whereas most of the time we're like, how do I get my mom's approval? How do I get my dad's approval? [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3596.58s)]
*  How do I guess that's a pretty easy set up package? It's a nice package that you realize over time [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3602.18s)]
*  The federal government has learned how to do this well [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3608.7000000000003s)]
*  Intentionally or accidentally because they've always been vested in making sure they the government itself [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3612.38s)]
*  Survives is there a moment in your life where you felt especially your professional life at CIA where you felt? [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3618.86s)]
*  Completely validated and [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3626.94s)]
*  Justified in your decision to spend all that time there [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3629.7400000000002s)]
*  Is there a mission that you succeeded in protecting America that you were like, this is everything I dreamed of and I did good [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3633.46s)]
*  So yes, there is one and that one is the one I was actually referencing [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3641.9s)]
*  Before we turn on any cameras, so I'm trying to get a book published and it's been a two and a half year process [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3647.54s)]
*  Because CIA was on board with the book and then changed their position as it got closer and closer to publish [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3654.2200000000003s)]
*  And why do you think I think geopolitical concerns around the world changed and then the mission that I was part of became more sensitive [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3661.08s)]
*  To them publicly. So now they're they're pushing back. So I actually [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3668.44s)]
*  After I leave this interview with you guys [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3673.7599999999998s)]
*  I head up to Washington DC in just a few days to sit with CIA to actually hash out [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3675.34s)]
*  How much of this book are you gonna keep pushing back on how much of this book are we gonna be allowed to publish and? [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3680.74s)]
*  Will we need to involve a court? Oh [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3685.2799999999997s)]
*  Wow to get this to move forward, okay [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3688.2s)]
*  No, so that's have to pee go go go go go go go go go go [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3691.2s)]
*  So the so the answer your question is yes [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3694.7599999999998s)]
*  There is absolutely a justifiable mission that I look at and I'm saying it was all worth it [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3697.44s)]
*  But you can't share it with us right now and that's very frustrating because the reason I want to share it [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3700.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't want to I love you guys. I'd love to share it with you [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3704.2s)]
*  I want to share it with my kids [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3706.7999999999997s)]
*  And my grandkids and my great-grandkids who I'll never get to meet the part of your legacy [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3708.84s)]
*  This process must be difficult is the book already written the books already written [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3713.08s)]
*  So, how do you have editors and great question people like review it and if this [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3716.64s)]
*  Like information in it that's not supposed to be seen. So this is the challenge because the geopolitical environment changed [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3722.36s)]
*  We had everything [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3728.04s)]
*  approved and worked on and written out until that turning point in in [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3729.88s)]
*  So it was it was okay [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3736.0s)]
*  So I wasn't trying to get you jammed up. No, no, it's all good. But that's how it works [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3738.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean the the reason that so few CIA authors exist is because of the exact problem that you said [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3742.24s)]
*  How do you get an editor to look at something if CIA has to look at it first? [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3748.12s)]
*  Then what if CIA looks at it and they take too long or whatever else? [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3751.6s)]
*  Publishers lose their interest and editors lose their interest and whatever else. Whereas for us we took a different approach to it [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3754.12s)]
*  We took kind of like a systematic approach where it's like hey, here's what we want to write about it. Do you approve? [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3760.12s)]
*  Here's our outline for what we're gonna write. Do you approve? Here's our summary for each chapter [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3764.12s)]
*  Approve and they approved every step of the way until we came to a point where there was a book proposal [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3768.34s)]
*  That they had previously approved in all previous versions but change in national security priorities kind of changed the whole sequence [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3773.6200000000003s)]
*  How do you feel about whistleblowers? I [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3780.86s)]
*  Have a very difficult time accepting whistleblowers. Why because I think that [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3784.0600000000004s)]
*  Whistleblowing let's name names. Okay, so ask what you really want [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3792.3s)]
*  We're talking about [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3799.3s)]
*  Snowden's one there's many [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3802.3s)]
*  so so when a whistleblower [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3804.3s)]
*  blows a whistle because it is a true infraction of American freedoms and [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3807.2200000000003s)]
*  Every other option hasn't worked [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3811.82s)]
*  Then a whistleblower that's what a whistleblower is intended to be [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3814.1400000000003s)]
*  That's why the law protects whistleblowers when they can prove that they've tried every other official channel. They can't go to jail [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3817.02s)]
*  They're protected by law [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3823.54s)]
*  What happens is people get either too afraid or too lazy to go through every other channel so they go right to the press [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3825.5s)]
*  That's the wrong kind of whistleblowing because that whistleblowing results in more damage than good. Hmm, right? [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3833.02s)]
*  Snowden is one of those examples [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3839.42s)]
*  He did not try every possible avenue internally before he went to the press [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3840.94s)]
*  Which is why the law can't protect him anymore. Yeah, and he immediately ran to our enemies which further proves [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3845.18s)]

*  Like whenever anybody blows the whistle the law is there to protect them to show that they have gone through every formal [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3861.2s)]
*  Option available before they have to simply make it public. Mmm, and that's basically what you're trying to do with the book, right? [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3867.84s)]

*  You're seeing that happen in Ukraine Russia like you're seeing it happen in NATO [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=3981.94s)]

*  And those were our closest allies right France Spain Germany are coming out and saying we shouldn't listen to the United States anymore [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4000.54s)]
*  Why do we listen to them? Right? You can't get funding for Ukraine right now. You've got the president and [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4006.2599999999998s)]
*  You've got the vice president and the head of national security inviting Israel's opposition leader [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4012.62s)]
*  To come to the United States because they can't talk to Netanyahu [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4017.6800000000003s)]
*  Right, and that's Israel. I mean Israel is one of our closest allies in the world and right now Biden and Netanyahu are at odds [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4020.88s)]
*  So you see this playing out and this is just within the last like six months to two years [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4027.04s)]
*  So when you start to project that forward, there's a presidential election coming up in November [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4032.4s)]
*  There is no good outcome from that election. Yeah, what do you think happens in that election? Nothing good [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4036.44s)]
*  But give me example you say that to say you don't like any of the candidates or first of all [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4041.48s)]
*  I'm saying that to say nobody likes any of the candidates [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4045.8s)]
*  There's nobody out there who's like Trump is the right choice and there's nobody out there saying Biden is the right choice [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4048.76s)]
*  There's a lot of people saying Trump is the best choice [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4054.2400000000002s)]
*  There's not a lot of people saying Trump is the right choice [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4056.84s)]

*  Fiery-point. So yeah, I think what we're gonna see either a Biden administration or Trump administration or some sort of emergency [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4077.28s)]
*  administration that happens because of something completely unforeseen on both sides, right like [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4085.48s)]
*  Biden's elected and then he has a heart attack and then there's an emergency administration or Trump's elected and then [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4090.28s)]
*  Some criminal conviction comes through that's that that makes it so is his [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4096.24s)]
*  Ability to serve as president is limited. Oh, right. There's also 82. So it's not like there's all sorts of surprises that can happen [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4101.52s)]
*  So you have to leave space for surprises, right? Yeah, but in all three scenarios [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4108.04s)]
*  It doesn't make it easy for the average American [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4112.0s)]
*  Hmm, how was our quality of life impacted and why would you want to leave that? So art I want to leave [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4114.16s)]

*  It's not us. Well, sorry. Here's where I'm stuck. I think it would be about ten years the awkward phase, right? [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4135.52s)]
*  What do you think comes after ten years? Is it not good after ten years? It's gonna settle out [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4140.92s)]

*  One I don't understand why they would let you leave [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4454.4800000000005s)]
*  to if [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4459.32s)]
*  I'm them and I want influence in the YouTube [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4461.32s)]
*  Podcasting space I want someone who is [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4465.72s)]
*  Eloquent intelligent knows the line. He's not gonna publish a book about something that he knows is illegal [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4468.5599999999995s)]
*  He'll publish it'll go through the you know proper procedure and maybe we give him permission and if we don't you know [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4474.08s)]
*  Maybe we'll string them along for a few years just to see if we would piss him off [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4479.76s)]
*  Just to see how loyal he is and then when he proves his loyalty, okay, maybe we'll put the book out there [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4482.36s)]
*  But we have someone in this YouTube space. The YouTube space is massive. This is where information is existing [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4487.08s)]
*  Intelligence is existing and he'll go on all the biggest podcasts and he'll do what he does best [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4492.24s)]
*  Which is make friends and assets of all these different people and imagine all the intelligence he can glean from that [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4497.64s)]
*  We'll let him have his consultation business where he can go and make millions of dollars. He deserves to do it [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4502.76s)]
*  We can't restrict him because then he would totally leave [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4508.0s)]
*  But if we need to call on him for anything if we need to call him for information, he will be there for us [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4509.8s)]
*  Tell me why I'm wrong because CIA would get all of that [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4517.0s)]
*  Without me being on the payroll at all [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4520.719999999999s)]
*  So so so they are getting it if they ask for it, but they don't ask for it [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4524.28s)]
*  That's so I'm not until until when so but that's that's no way [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4528.76s)]
*  You're thinking of CIA again, like it's a corporation. The corporation would take those steps because it'd be worth the investment [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4533.0s)]
*  Yeah, CIA is the DMV the DMV would not take those steps. What about right now CIA is a bureaucracy [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4538.719999999999s)]
*  They are very confused about what to even do with me. Yeah, what do they think of you right now? [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4544.88s)]
*  Have you spoken to them at all? Yeah, it's a it's a mixed bag. It's a split decision there [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4548.88s)]
*  So give me both sides. Yeah [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4552.64s)]
*  So there is the one camp which is the older-school camp which believes that anything we do that [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4554.16s)]
*  Capitalizes on our service and our time at CIA using the term CIA is just us shilling out our background to try to make a buck [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4560.28s)]
*  So that's the negative side, but then there's another side. That's like somebody out there needs to be saying good things about CIA [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4567.96s)]
*  Because everybody else who comes out and talks about CIA says shitty things about CIA [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4574.8s)]
*  So we've got a foot in both. There's a PR war going on here, right? [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4578.96s)]
*  I don't necessarily think that you do bad PR for the CIA. Like I'm kind of [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4582.4400000000005s)]
*  Like if you saw Homeland, which I assume the CIA [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4587.2s)]
*  Signs off on on some level or it's it's because it's it's not written or authored by a CIA officer [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4590.28s)]
*  Yeah, there's no requirement for CIA to chop off on it. Oh, well that shit is [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4597.0s)]
*  Is exciting [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4601.72s)]
*  You know, I'm not saying how accurate no it might not be accurate but still like you coming and you talking about this, right? I [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4604.16s)]
*  Would imagine there are young talented people out there that [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4610.8s)]
*  Would listen to this or watch this and then go wow [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4614.96s)]
*  I wonder if my skill set would lend itself to the CIA and that might be something exciting to do [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4618.2s)]
*  I don't necessarily see you as somebody who is [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4622.8s)]
*  Painting the CIA as this horrible organization. It doesn't even seem like you dislike them [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4626.04s)]
*  It seems like you think there's a lack of efficiency and that could be restructured [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4630.719999999999s)]
*  But as far as an organization, I believe you feel like it's important. Absolutely [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4635.0s)]
*  so everything you're saying is accurate, right and everything you're saying is the work that I put into [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4640.04s)]
*  my public message about CIA because I [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4645.679999999999s)]
*  Personally as an American and as a father and as a former CIA officer [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4648.839999999999s)]
*  I want the next generation of high-performing hard-working talented people to join the agency [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4653.0s)]
*  Whether they joined for two years six years or ten years all of us benefit from them joining the agency instead of joining [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4658.2s)]
*  the sales department at [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4664.28s)]
*  You know, but here's here's here is an issue though. You're an intelligent dude [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4666.2s)]
*  You have found a way to I would imagine make 10x 20x what you were making at the CIA [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4670.96s)]
*  Almost immediately after leaving right the people with the level of intelligence to work at the CIA [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4677.400000000001s)]
*  And I'm assuming that there needs to be some IQ requirement, right? [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4682.92s)]
*  You could have all this stuff where you don't feel guilt, but if you're dumb, that's not gonna work, right? [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4685.88s)]
*  They you need to have an aptitude. You need to be able to learn these things [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4691.36s)]
*  You need to learn them quickly and you just put them out in the field [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4693.92s)]
*  somebody with that level of intellect and that lack of [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4697.04s)]
*  Do we call it empathy or lack of the feeling of guilt? [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4700.68s)]
*  That's a huge advantage in the regular workplace. It is you would rise quickly and make so much more money [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4703.56s)]
*  So how do we incentivize these people? [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4709.64s)]
*  How do we incentivize smart people in the same way that we can't get smart people be politicians anymore? [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4711.4800000000005s)]
*  How do we get them to be in government agencies at all? [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4715.6s)]
*  Well, that's that's the question you guys are all gonna be hedge fund dudes like people in your position. That's the million dollar question [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4717.88s)]
*  That's why you see so that's why you see there's a military recruiting crisis [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4723.4400000000005s)]
*  If you guys weren't aware of that military hasn't hit recruitment record recruitment numbers in two years [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4727.18s)]
*  Federal government can't recruit people fast enough, right? [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4732.08s)]
*  There's there's a dearth of interested candidates in supporting the federal government because they see the federal government and put yourself in the shoes of like a [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4734.92s)]
*  Of a 14 year old. Yeah back in [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4742.2s)]
*  2009 or 2005 that 14 year old who is now whatever the age is 18 [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4745.84s)]
*  21 mm-hmm 23 right that that child then has watched utter chaos in government [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4751.16s)]
*  And now they're deciding do I want to work for? [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4757.68s)]
*  Google or do I want to work for the federal government? It's an easy answer [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4760.36s)]
*  There's also like is there been a war that we feel has been justified that we want to support [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4763.36s)]
*  So if you're a young kid seeing that and that's the ideology great boy, you know, I mean, that's the ideology Jeff [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4767.639999999999s)]
*  I mean getting people to [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4772.679999999999s)]
*  Getting people to join the army around like World War two might have been one of the easier things to do [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4774.92s)]
*  You're like I want to go defend my nation even after 9-eleven. There are people who are like I want to go [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4779.96s)]
*  Listen, let's get this get back. Nobody can fuck with America not while we're here [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4784.259999999999s)]
*  So I guess it is up to [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4788.08s)]
*  America and the powers that be to make sure that whatever wars we're engaging in are just enough to sacrifice our lives [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4790.88s)]
*  And if there is waning military support, that's on you [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4796.8s)]
*  Correct, you know what I mean? Correct. Yeah, it's not on the people for understanding [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4802.96s)]
*  What the fuck is going on if you look at if you look at veterans now [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4806.96s)]
*  It's shocking how many veterans exist right now that do not want their children to join the military when it used to be [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4811.08s)]
*  a [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4818.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that and make sense. Yeah, completely logical sense, but the only veterans I know are like I would never never [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4820.4800000000005s)]
*  But that wasn't the case. It was my grandfather was a captain [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4827.0s)]
*  Yeah, big part of the reason I was military my uncle was in the military [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4830.08s)]
*  My mom was in the military. My stepdad was in the military. My aunt was in the military [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4833.2s)]
*  That's what you do. So because it was so easy to recruit did that make them lazy when it came to [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4836.88s)]
*  like supplying services for [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4841.68s)]
*  Vets and then now they're in the opposite situation [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4843.88s)]
*  I think yes and no I think it was easy for them to recruit so they didn't pay attention to what you do on the tail [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4846.72s)]
*  End of that person's career. So yes, I think there's validity there [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4852.68s)]
*  But I think the larger thing that happened there is as the information age also took over [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4855.4400000000005s)]
*  20 years in the military between [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4861.0s)]
*  1990 and 2010 is a massive 20-year transformation in technology [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4863.96s)]
*  So then we all woke up to the fact that the reason that there is a veterans affair [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4868.88s)]
*  There's a reason the reason you get lifetime medical benefits is because when you serve for the US military [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4873.24s)]
*  they don't care about your health and your well-being and your mental health like you're there to be a cog in a warwheel and [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4879.400000000001s)]
*  Some cogs in the war wheels die and get medals [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4885.6s)]
*  But many many more cogs in the war wheel get traumatized get hurt and then they need medical care for the rest of their lives [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4888.28s)]
*  And they don't have adequate medical psychological whatever care [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4894.92s)]
*  Strip a lot of D bonuses are incentives away like schooling and housing and things like that that were easier to get and now it's like [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4898.84s)]
*  They're stripping some of that away and that's because of cost structure. Right? So now with a recruitment crisis [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4906.2s)]
*  It's hard for the federal government to fund recruitment operations [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4910.4s)]
*  So then budgets start to shrink where they save where they find money to get more recruits [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4913.76s)]
*  They take benefits away and then you have a we have more people who stay for [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4918.24s)]
*  Four or five or eight years and less people who stay for 20 years [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4922.08s)]
*  So the whole economics of military and government start to shift [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4925.88s)]
*  Do you can you explain to us? [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4930.320000000001s)]
*  What the military industrial complex is and how the CIA plays a part in it? [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4933.52s)]
*  so the the short [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4940.76s)]
*  the short hard-hitting answer is that the military industrial complex is [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4942.92s)]
*  Our economic security blanket. That's that's what it is [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4948.12s)]
*  the reason that the United States [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4952.56s)]
*  Loves war is because war ends recessions [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4954.84s)]
*  Mm-hmm. And the reason that war ends recessions is because the military industrial complex spins up [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4959.0s)]
*  Tens of thousands of jobs are made massive government spending is made people make a whole hell of a lot more money [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4964.76s)]
*  More taxes is taken and then all that military industrial produce all the production isn't just for us [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4970.56s)]
*  It can be sold to the UK. It can be sold to France can be sold to Germany be sold to Israel [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4977.88s)]
*  You have money coming in yeah [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4982.04s)]
*  You have money coming in and the people who are when foreign countries buy American goods [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4984.04s)]
*  What denomination do they use what currency they use American? So then how do they get American dollar? [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4988.28s)]
*  They got a buy them American and then as you buy American dollars [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4992.88s)]
*  It takes American dollars off the market, which does what to the value of your currency? [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4996.2s)]
*  It's net it's like a triple threat. It's like Justin Timberlake, man [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=4999.88s)]
*  This is really well said so that's why the military industrial complex was designed and it's a big part of the reason that [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5004.8s)]
*  Eisenhower warned against it. Yeah his his speech when he left office. Yep [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5012.2s)]
*  Once we create this beast you can never put this back in a box [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5017.16s)]
*  It's always going to be there and it has contributed to our wealth over time [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5020.44s)]
*  It is the thing that China is trying to do right now the thing China is trying to replicate is its own [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5024.62s)]
*  military industrial complex [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5031.0s)]
*  So because it has watched us [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5032.8s)]
*  for economic and international gain for the last 30 years now doesn't it need war in order to [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5035.08s)]
*  Properly utilize it it needs conflict exactly right my understanding with China's foreign policy that wasn't conflict-based [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5041.5s)]
*  It was more like investment and infrastructure based. That's that works Silk Road initiative. What is it called? [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5048.219999999999s)]
*  Belton Road Belton Road. Yeah. Okay, so China's from 1990 to about I'm sorry from 1980 to about [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5055.219999999999s)]
*  2010 China was primarily focused on Belt and Road initiative on [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5064.7s)]
*  Diplomacy economic diplomacy, and that's why you saw what they call the China miracle where China went from I mean speaking of per capita [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5068.94s)]
*  Yeah, China went from [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5076.759999999999s)]
*  five hundred and thirty seven dollars annual income per capita to [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5079.259999999999s)]
*  Five thousand dollars. Yeah, think about that. Yeah, I mean a starving population to cities popping up everywhere. Unbelievable. Yeah, so [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5084.78s)]
*  A 10x change. Yeah in the average household income and the average person's income in just 30 years [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5091.259999999999s)]
*  And we're talking about one point four billion people [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5097.18s)]
*  We're not talking about a country of a million people where you can get that change. Okay, so you're saying so they they were engaging in that [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5099.18s)]
*  Let's let's be the world's producer. Let's be the world's warehouse. Yeah, and the world's workforce. Yeah for a long time [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5105.18s)]
*  Yeah, well when Xi Jinping took power he started to say well [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5111.660000000001s)]
*  What are we gonna do for the next 50 years? [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5115.860000000001s)]
*  Which is why I came up with the 50-year plan and when he started looking 50 years out [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5116.900000000001s)]
*  He started realizing that if you're the world's manufacturer, then you're always manufacturing somebody else's goods. Yeah [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5120.14s)]
*  And then looking at the United States we are we used to be the world's manufacturer [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5125.66s)]
*  Yep, and then we exported that and we took on tech jobs [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5130.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, and we took on innovation and we took on innovation and that is now what do we export to the world? [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5133.18s)]
*  Yeah, so now if anybody wants to import an American good like yes, they might get rice and strawberries sometimes [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5139.9s)]
*  But most of the time they're importing financial structures. They're importing technology [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5145.38s)]
*  Big big stuff that has IP behind it not actual tangible plastic goods [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5149.54s)]
*  Yeah, interesting. So yeah on the military industrial complex real quick. I just want you to explain [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5154.54s)]
*  So you're saying now China is going to transition into military industrial complex, which would mean that they would need conflict [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5159.46s)]
*  You got to use the bombs, right? So for the last five years or so what we've seen is a really aggressive push [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5166.46s)]
*  For China to change its economic foundation away from being the world's biggest producer [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5172.06s)]
*  Foundation away from being the world's manufacturer and into being the world's tech alternative to the United States [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5177.5s)]
*  once Huawei [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5184.419999999999s)]
*  Competition exists you can't put that back in a box. So what's different is the United States? [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5187.379999999999s)]
*  We like to win like a good football game. We like to win where it's like, you know second quarter [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5192.179999999999s)]
*  Like last half of the game. We're 15 points behind and then we win by one the chief Super Bowl this year [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5198.98s)]
*  That's what we want. Yeah, right. We want a huge finish a huge dominant and everybody talks about it for decades [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5204.66s)]
*  What China wants is China wants to win like soccer, right? [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5209.38s)]
*  Like small incremental gains until there's parity [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5212.82s)]
*  What once the United States who is the world's economic superpower once we have parity with another country, which is equality with another country [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5216.54s)]
*  Guess what happens to us? [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5223.9s)]
*  our security status [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5225.9s)]
*  Completely transformed why is that because we're no longer the dominant power because there's another alternative [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5228.34s)]
*  You can go to there's one restaurant in neighborhood. That's the only one that's serving the food [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5234.1s)]
*  They could charge whatever they want. It's like if you're playing second [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5238.5s)]
*  There's another restaurant in that neighborhood all of a sudden the price has got to come down. We're watching Chinese movies [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5240.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, right. We already do [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5246.5s)]
*  This is this is really interesting, but you still haven't explained what what's happening with their military industrial complex [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5249.9400000000005s)]
*  How will they engage in these I assume what happens with us right now is instead of us engaging in the hot war and yet? [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5255.22s)]
*  There's a lot of proxy wars right that we are funding with weapons and [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5262.1s)]
*  And so the United States, I don't know if you guys are aware of this the United States has 20 different special operations groups, okay? [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5266.9400000000005s)]
*  That's a lot. What is it? Is that like Rangers and seals? Those are special operations groups got our nearest allies [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5274.38s)]
*  With very few exceptions like France Germany Spain the UK they have like four got it [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5281.700000000001s)]
*  So we have 20 the next largest country or the next country with the most is Israel [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5287.1s)]
*  Israel has 18 different special operations. Oh wow [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5292.06s)]
*  The reason that you have these special operations groups is so that you can have a constant rotation of active training in real-world conflict [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5294.900000000001s)]
*  So we have people in Somalia and people in Mogadishu and people in [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5301.54s)]
*  Colombia and people in Peru and we have people constantly fighting in support of [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5305.06s)]
*  Joint forces in support of allied forces and peacekeeping missions, right? [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5310.18s)]
*  These are people who give real-time experience with real weapons firing downrange and shooting people for real [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5315.22s)]
*  Without it being a war. That's why we like proxy war [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5320.84s)]
*  So that we keep them warm. We keep them warm constantly training constantly training China never had that and it's crazy to call training [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5324.5599999999995s)]
*  It's a real fucking war. Yeah, but we see it for its training value and then you rotate people through that [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5332.32s)]
*  Jesus Christ now when you look at what's happened the last year real quick on real quick on that [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5338.639999999999s)]
*  Knowing that we need training [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5344.48s)]
*  Do we induce some of these conflicts so that we can have it or is or do we kind of seek them out and then [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5346.24s)]
*  Apply force it's it's more of the latter than the first we seek them out [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5352.44s)]
*  But once you have the biggest kid in the playground on your side [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5357.599999999999s)]
*  You're a whole hell of a lot more confident pushing the conference [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5362.72s)]
*  You're saying the other countries knowing that the US is gonna come in and we're not really mad at it because we need some training [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5365.8s)]
*  Yeah, right. So they go starts just our presence [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5371.4s)]
*  Unintentionally will stoke more war correct. It's yeah, it's like [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5374.339999999999s)]
*  The way you would talk shit if you got a bodyguard [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5378.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, she has a very different energy than when you write it yourself. Okay, go on go on [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5380.48s)]
*  So now if you if you understand that China has been investing more in its military industrial complex [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5384.98s)]
*  Then it has been outpacing its investment in military industrial complex than its own GDP growth [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5391.74s)]
*  Well for the last five years and it's already projecting next year to do it again [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5397.58s)]
*  Wow, so that means it GDP wise economically it should only be investing about 4% but it's going investing 9% [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5402.14s)]
*  So it's over spending on military development [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5408.84s)]
*  Combine that with the fact that in the last few months [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5412.06s)]
*  Taiwan actually just sent out a warning today saying that they're concerned because China has normalized meaning it's so common that [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5415.38s)]
*  They have normalized military exercises in the region around Taiwan [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5422.9400000000005s)]
*  Including in Taiwan airspace and Taiwan naval space littoral space [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5427.46s)]
*  Yeah, so the reason that like China is normalizing that type of military activity because the first stage [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5431.48s)]
*  To military industrial domination the first stage is being able to protect the homeland [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5438.12s)]
*  This is why the Civil War was so critical. I know people think the Civil War was about slavery [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5443.5199999999995s)]
*  It was not the Civil War was about being able to create one country where from coast to coast [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5447.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5453.679999999999s)]
*  We fell under one legal jurisdiction one country because it's easier to defend a country [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5454.12s)]
*  When it's one country with two sea borders [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5460.0s)]
*  Countries with two sea borders and land borders look at Russia. Yep [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5463.72s)]
*  Hmm, right. You got to worry about every single country around you joining NATO B is then there might be a base that's put right up [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5467.72s)]
*  On your borders. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, exactly [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5472.4800000000005s)]
*  so what China is doing now is it's normalizing this military activity around Taiwan and [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5474.16s)]
*  it's doing that because it knows that with the size of military it has and with the modern military that it has for any other [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5478.2s)]
*  foreign aggressor to come to their home court and [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5484.96s)]
*  Beat them is gonna be difficult [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5488.96s)]
*  Their plan for the next ten years is to grow their ability to extend or reach their military out [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5491.2s)]
*  So first you protect yourself once you can protect yourself now [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5496.12s)]
*  It's time to dominate abroad and do you think that they will start engaging in proxy wars? [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5499.719999999999s)]
*  They're already engaging in proxy where all over Southeast Asia all over Africa. What about what about South America? [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5504.32s)]
*  South America's are they involved in Venezuela? So South America is interesting. I can't speak knowledgeably on it right now [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5511.4s)]
*  Okay, what the Chinese have found is that because of the rapid growth they had from the 1980s to the 2010s [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5517.44s)]
*  They had a surplus of revenue surplus of money so they could throw that money around [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5523.96s)]
*  That's what the Belt and Road Initiative is [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5528.04s)]
*  They the Belt and Road Initiative made it so that so that China could send could extend loans [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5529.679999999999s)]
*  To impoverished countries at rates that no Western. Yeah, we could compete with yeah, they were beating the World Bank, right? [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5534.92s)]
*  They're and the World Bank gives you the loan right? [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5541.44s)]
*  Specifically low so they can put you in the debt and whatever so China basically followed that same model learning from us [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5544.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5549.56s)]
*  so when it came to Latin America [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5549.92s)]
*  They didn't have to engage in proxy wars because there were so many people there they were just willing to take loans in exchange for [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5551.52s)]
*  You know hundred-year leases and property to land rights [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5556.4400000000005s)]
*  They basically just bought the Caribbean and they bought most of Central America and they bought parts of South America [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5559.52s)]
*  They just own for like 99 year leases. We just let them do that [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5565.280000000001s)]
*  We tried not to but the United States is a capitalist country [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5568.72s)]
*  We don't extend loans that are going to default. We can't do that because of checks and balances [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5572.76s)]
*  So then we rely on foreign aid to do it [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5579.16s)]
*  Well, guess what happens with foreign aid foreign aid is not reliable because if you're hot you get lots of foreign aid if you're cold [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5581.360000000001s)]
*  Oh, you don't get lots of foreign aid [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5586.72s)]
*  So when you're the when you're the corrupt leader of Panama and you're like, which of these two choices do I take? [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5588.400000000001s)]
*  That one say you think China is the next superpower. I would assume it's China or one of the Middle Eastern countries [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5594.2s)]
*  Yeah, so China is the one that's the closest [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5599.4800000000005s)]
*  Econoc economic experts believe that by 2030 China will have will have reached economic parity with the United States all things remaining the same [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5602.24s)]
*  So all things remain the same means we also have to remain the same if we don't change [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5610.24s)]
*  We will see the rise of China to economic parity with the United States [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5615.0s)]
*  Which in my opinion is just as bad as China being dominant [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5618.12s)]
*  Yeah, right. Let's the effects of the exact same the effects are the same. Yeah, whether they're 1% better 10% better [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5620.72s)]
*  It sounds far off. It's six years from now. It's six years from now. Wait, so you never answer the question [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5626.2s)]
*  So where are you going to live? So I plan on moving to Europe where where so? [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5630.92s)]
*  Portugal Spain Italy [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5636.08s)]
*  Those are three of my top Croatia fire options. Yeah [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5639.16s)]
*  Those are all countries that have a number of things going for them. I'm also looking at Sweden [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5643.04s)]
*  First of all, they don't want to be a sweet number. They're neutral countries [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5647.24s)]
*  Nobody sees those countries incredible. I just live in Spain. It's the best. Nobody sees those countries as a threat [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5651.88s)]
*  Yeah, so as the set the economic superpowers of the world start to fight over everything [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5657.36s)]
*  Yeah, that fights not going to Poland or that fights not going to Portugal that fights not going to Spain [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5662.2s)]
*  Oh, you're worried about hot war. I'm worried about hot war. I'm worried about [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5666.5599999999995s)]
*  economic war I'm worried about the [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5670.8s)]
*  forcing of policy like domestic policy in foreign countries [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5673.96s)]
*  Because that's that's essentially what both the United States and China do the United States. We're no innocent country [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5678.04s)]
*  Like we force our policies we force domestic policies in other countries [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5683.719999999999s)]
*  That's why democracy grew was because we forced it [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5688.719999999999s)]
*  We basically said you have to have free and fair elections if you want our money [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5691.639999999999s)]
*  You have to do this and who defined free and fair elections. We do we did [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5695.32s)]
*  We're also the country that came up with gerrymandering. Yeah, right. So like it's it's fucked up, but that's China has learned from that [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5699.2s)]
*  That's what they do in Hong Kong. It's what they do in Malaysia. It's what they do in the Philippines, right? [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5706.36s)]
*  They try to force foreign policy Andrew says this a lot and I think it's true when America is not a superpower [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5710.6s)]
*  Let's say it's China and this is why I'm scared of China. You're gonna miss the American superpower because I don't know that they're gonna be remotely [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5716.64s)]
*  Friendly with how they try to exert their you know, even like front-facing friendly with how they try to exert their control [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5724.92s)]
*  Is that something you think happens? Are you afraid of that? I wouldn't so [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5730.200000000001s)]
*  fear is [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5734.56s)]
*  Less of how I define it. It's more like a series of [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5736.12s)]
*  Probabilities is that a probability you see that's absolutely a probability [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5740.88s)]
*  I see and you're the way that China executes on its ambitions is different than the way the United States executes on their [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5744.08s)]
*  Ambition that was my next question, right? We try to incentivize people to do what we want them to do [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5749.98s)]
*  Hey do it and it might be a little bit bad for you, but it'll also be really good for you [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5753.92s)]
*  Right Asian parents. That's not the Asian way of doing things [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5758.36s)]
*  The Asian way of doing things is do it this way or you'll be punished or else [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5760.8s)]
*  So I like the world of incentives because incentives always give you options but the world of enforcement is [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5764.2s)]
*  Difficult and so this is this is why [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5771.04s)]
*  Ten years will help to define kind of what's gonna happen to all of us [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5773.719999999999s)]
*  Well, but the next 15 to 20 years after that is gonna look like this seahorse right or this [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5777.639999999999s)]
*  Seasaw this this rocking back and forth of you know, democracy becomes a little bit more in vogue [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5783.96s)]
*  Yeah, authoritarian power becomes a little bit more in vogue [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5790.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, as we're all kind of trapped in this fact of which of these do we really choose? [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5792.94s)]
*  Can you speak about Chinese officers or operators in America right now? [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5797.639999999999s)]
*  So what I can speak on that's allowed is the stuff that has been making headlines more and more [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5804.259999999999s)]
*  We know that the Chinese have secret police stations in the United States and Canada. It really was big big deal in Canada [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5811.82s)]
*  Everything's a bigger deal in Canada. Yeah, maple syrup is a bigger deal in Canada [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5819.26s)]
*  Yeah, but so and they do that because at at the core of the Chinese experience [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5823.0599999999995s)]
*  Like we talked about the American experience at the core of the Chinese experience. You are Chinese first [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5829.78s)]
*  That's ideology that we're talking about [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5835.3s)]
*  Right, so you you have such a close tie to your family and you have such a close tie to the homeland [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5837.82s)]
*  Then even if you are a Chinese immigrant, you're still fighting for your family and for the homeland [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5843.58s)]
*  Right. It's still your first loyalty doesn't mean it's your first loyalty by like 99 to 1 [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5848.46s)]
*  it could be 60 40, but it's still your first loyalty and [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5852.860000000001s)]
*  You are oftentimes responsible for caring for the older generation [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5857.1s)]
*  So your revenue your money is actually going back to China to take care of your parents until you can bring them to the United States [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5860.06s)]
*  So which is quite common for immigrants though. It is. Yeah, I don't think it's a specific idiosyncratic [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5865.5s)]
*  Supposedly to the US ideology, which is self-first out of school in the United States [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5871.38s)]
*  Mom and dad have a retirement fund and they have Social Security right and they save their own 401k [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5876.379999999999s)]
*  And if they didn't well, why the hell didn't you do that? Mom and dad? Yeah, yeah [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5880.86s)]
*  Yeah, like now you're draining on me [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5884.9s)]
*  How does it feel that you know, the the grandkids are eating ramen because you can't pay your diabetes bill or whatever it is [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5886.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah, like that's a whole different mindset in the United States. Yeah, so stuff like secret police stations that are not sanctioned [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5892.7s)]
*  The incredible amount of Chinese intelligence collection that happens here in the last week before coming here we had a military [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5900.66s)]
*  Person a US military officer or so US military enlisted person get arrested for Chinese espionage. We had Google a [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5909.5s)]
*  Technician at Google got arrested for Chinese espionage [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5917.139999999999s)]
*  Wow, right [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5919.299999999999s)]
*  So the Chinese are actually actively recruiting from our tech sector and from our military and that's just in the last seven days [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5920.099999999999s)]
*  When you look at the prosecuted cases of Chinese espionage in the United States over the last five years, it's record-breaking [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5927.0199999999995s)]
*  more intelligence espionage case arrests just arrests than ever before [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5934.0599999999995s)]
*  Every time there's an arrest our rule of thumb is for every one arrest. There's nine more operations that haven't been caught. Whoa [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5939.94s)]
*  So it gives you an idea of [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5946.22s)]
*  How active the Chinese are against the United States? I don't want to paint the Chinese out to be a bad guy [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5948.5s)]
*  They're just doing the same shit we do this is the game but we're the big dog [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5953.139999999999s)]
*  They're trying to become the big they're a little meaner dog though. They're a very different breed [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5958.22s)]
*  What is their offer for espionage? Is it just money? [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5962.74s)]
*  So this is so the offer for espionage when we talk about the offer we have to remember it goes back to those four [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5965.62s)]
*  Right those four ideologies or there's four motivations [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5971.42s)]
*  Reward we usually associate with money, but reward is not about money. It's about what you will do with the money, right? [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5975.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, you guys don't work for money [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5982.66s)]
*  You might think it's that service level. Of course. I work for the money [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5985.42s)]
*  No, no, no, you work for what you're gonna do with the money with the money [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5988.26s)]
*  Okay, so what the Chinese have learned about our culture is that in our culture? [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5991.38s)]
*  We all brag about the money and we keep secret what we're gonna do with the money [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=5996.82s)]
*  It's really there because I'm worried that my kids might not have enough money for college [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6000.78s)]
*  It's really there because I'm worried about when I get older and I get sick [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6005.04s)]
*  It's there because I'm worried about something or something else [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6007.8s)]
*  So when they make a plea for us or when they make an offer to us for money [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6010.1s)]
*  Oftentimes it's because we're already in debt and we've made bad financial choices because our culture is a debt-driven culture [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6014.54s)]
*  And we're also worried about money in the future because we're already in debt [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6020.9800000000005s)]
*  So it makes it very easy for them to come in with a monetary [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6025.14s)]
*  Salvation Wow, and we're like, oh shit. Yeah, I mean my secrets are worth that much to you [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6028.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because my own government doesn't think they're worth that much to them 200k in student loan debt [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6033.700000000001s)]
*  Even though I work at Google, I still have a lot of debt. I'm worried [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6037.58s)]
*  Yeah, and then you've got the whole the ideology of the United States also includes cultural ideology [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6040.18s)]
*  That doesn't exist in Asia [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6047.38s)]
*  like for example [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6049.1s)]
*  It's sex is still a taboo topic in the United States as as open as it's become [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6050.26s)]
*  It's still a very taboo topic like the whole sexual deviance anything [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6055.46s)]
*  I was just telling you guys right we don't really like to talk about what our particular kink is with just anyone [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6058.38s)]
*  We don't really like to talk about how often we have sex or don't have sex with our spouse or a girlfriend or whatever else [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6064.06s)]
*  We don't like talking about whether or not we explored homosexuality in college [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6069.34s)]
*  There's all sorts of stuff that we don't talk about [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6073.1s)]
*  That Europe talks about on the front page of the newspaper that they that they'll go out and have drinks and like cheers each other [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6075.26s)]
*  And China way more comfortable with it. No, but China hard to believe you they're not more comfortable with it [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6080.660000000001s)]
*  But they know we are uncomfortable with it. So they know how to present us with what's known as in in [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6084.9800000000005s)]
*  colloquial terms sex espionage [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6091.860000000001s)]
*  They can feed our sexual interests [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6094.1s)]
*  Because they don't have individual free. It is what the [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6097.38s)]
*  I guess I see I accused Trump of doing with Russia like oh you got peed on you want anybody know that [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6102.1s)]
*  We got you get peed on now. We hold this power over you China will do that to [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6106.700000000001s)]
*  Someone that's that's the sea and rice. That's coercion blackmail is coercion [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6110.580000000001s)]
*  The other option to that is you get a Chinese girlfriend a child a discrete quiet [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6114.660000000001s)]
*  Beautiful girlfriend that goes where you need her to go when you need her go there and she treats you like a king every time [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6120.22s)]
*  You arrive so every couple in Williamsburg is just spying [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6124.5199999999995s)]
*  Not a far-off accusation right but you want to know why all those I mean there's a there's a real problem with American academics [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6130.14s)]
*  Traveling to Asia. Yeah [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6137.1s)]
*  the reason that such a problem is because [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6138.7s)]
*  They land in Kuala Lumpur and they have their Chinese girlfriend waiting for them for four days that their spouse doesn't even know about all taken [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6141.12s)]
*  Care of by the academic institution that invited them there and those girls [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6146.82s)]
*  Might not start as operatives [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6152.099999999999s)]
*  They might just be that's from the hookers or misters or whatever and then they become an asset of an operative, right? [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6154.54s)]
*  Yeah, this is so interesting and then you're saying that we can't do it in America because we have individual freedoms in other words [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6161.62s)]
*  Force an American to become to prostitute their body [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6167.74s)]
*  Yeah [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6170.62s)]
*  Now if they do it they do it but we can't say this is what you should do correct and if they do it [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6170.98s)]
*  So not only that but in the United States, we've also gone for our actual trained [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6175.14s)]
*  Agents are trained field operators. We actively enforce that they don't take that step because when you take that step it's any [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6180.02s)]
*  Any kind of romantic or physical anything? [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6188.02s)]
*  Yeah, because of our ideology in the United States sex is very difficult to separate from connection [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6190.46s)]
*  Okay, our control have you have has anybody ever tried to flip you? [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6197.14s)]
*  We've all been attempted in different ways [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6202.26s)]
*  And how did you know could you tell they were an agent? Yeah, more they do. Where were you? [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6205.18s)]
*  So the can you say where you were? Yeah, so they're so my time at CIA. I can't talk about that [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6209.34s)]
*  Okay, when I left CIA, one of my first big jobs was in private intelligence [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6215.3s)]
*  Okay, I went to the United Arab Emirates UAE [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6219.54s)]
*  Okay to carry on a private intelligence contract there because they were pulling from the Trump school of thought and they're like hey [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6222.660000000001s)]
*  we're gonna privatize our intelligence also and [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6228.4400000000005s)]
*  It was a it was a high-paying job in a foreign place [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6230.94s)]
*  I could take my family and write my own check right so so you had to go get intelligence on someone out there [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6234.14s)]
*  Can you speak on it? Mm-hmm? It's an NDA contract. So but I was supporting private intelligence in Abu Dhabi, right? [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6239.94s)]
*  So those are our peoples out there, you know, I mean well there there are allies right? Yeah, so [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6249.0599999999995s)]
*  When you're out there, you're also presented to [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6254.94s)]
*  Everybody else who's traveling through Dubai or traveling through Abu Dhabi [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6258.360000000001s)]
*  So you got the Russians and the Chinese and the North Koreans the Iranians all of them can travel through [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6261.04s)]
*  The Middle East unlike they can in parts of Europe, right? So you have everybody presented to you all the time [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6266.6s)]
*  so what oftentimes happens is it's not like it is in the movies or somebody walks up to you and they're like they so they [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6272.72s)]
*  Hand you like a suitcase and they're like you going spy for us now, right? [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6278.46s)]
*  It's not it's not quite like that instead they they try to build a relationship with you [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6282.160000000001s)]
*  They try to find out what you do, you know, they're a foreigner you hear the foreign accent [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6286.26s)]
*  You know [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6290.52s)]
*  They're a foreigner because they they have an ID a national ID in the Emirates that said that says what your nationality is, right? [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6290.900000000001s)]
*  But you still have to do business with all of them [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6298.3s)]
*  So you're you have to work with the Chinese and the Israelis and the Russians the difference is how do you determine? [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6301.24s)]
*  Which are doing a job? How'd you do it and what you're doing the other job? Yeah, what gave it away? [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6307.3s)]
*  Well, it doesn't you know [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6311.74s)]
*  It doesn't get given away until they start asking you to have like personal relationships where you keep secrets [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6313.26s)]
*  Okay, and give me example like was there anybody who was really good and while it was happening you're like, oh these motherfuckers [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6318.139999999999s)]
*  This is a new level. I didn't even so the Mossad is actually really good at this [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6323.179999999999s)]
*  Okay, so tell me tell me so when Mossad Mossad will work with you [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6327.46s)]
*  Israeli intelligence Israeli foreign collection. Yeah shin bet is their FBI is their FBI got it. So Israeli Mossad will [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6332.26s)]
*  They'll work with you. They'll collaborate with you. They'll share with you [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6339.74s)]
*  Everything's a team fight and it's always in the workplace [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6342.26s)]
*  Until you have a big victory and then when you have a big victory then they're like [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6345.22s)]
*  We should celebrate this at this nice hotel or at this nice bar or whatever else [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6348.74s)]
*  We've got a connection through the you know [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6353.38s)]
*  The Israeli connections and now we're gonna have like a private room and all this other stuff and it's gonna be this bang-up party [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6355.5s)]
*  Once as an as a trained intelligence officer once someone takes you from a public setting into a private setting [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6361.54s)]
*  You know that you're now on a what we call a developmental path [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6367.34s)]
*  They're trying to develop you into so you're an asset to it. You're immediately red flagged. Okay, right [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6370.7s)]
*  Wait red flag me you red flag them. Yeah [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6376.66s)]
*  But at the same time like there's lots of cultures just want to party. Yeah, so you go to the party [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6380.1s)]
*  Okay, this is good this is good this is good you have to assess then what happens at the party [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6390.46s)]
*  So you're at this party so now when you're at the party again [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6393.7s)]
*  Standard massage tactic is you're at the party and then they'll start pulling you off of the main party to have like these sidebar [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6396.5s)]
*  conversations about work stuff like hey [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6402.26s)]
*  It was incredible that you found that thing is it from that deep fake video and you're able to reverse engineer who it came from [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6405.66s)]
*  How did you do that? Like can you tell me how you did that? [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6410.94s)]
*  So this is why it's important that you don't use substances if you're a little loose with the drinks [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6413.86s)]
*  You might volunteer that information right and you've already built a report these people you guys just celebrate a victory [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6417.78s)]
*  Your teammates hard enough sober. Yeah, not talk. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay this so you can any stroke in your ego [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6423.26s)]
*  What you did and exactly so you can see yourself going down this this what we could we also call it a slippery slope [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6429.22s)]
*  If you ever climbed a tall mountain, of course you get past the tree line you get into the rocks [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6435.38s)]
*  It's like a rock scramble. We call that a slippery slope in espionage, too [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6438.76s)]
*  Once you cross that tree line, it's very hard to keep from slipping. How do you maintain your relationship with them? [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6442.02s)]
*  While shutting down their questioning you have to there has to be a point with a trained intelligence person where you [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6449.1s)]
*  Use a language that they understand to let them know that the development stops there. Can you say what that is? [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6457.46s)]
*  Yeah, so you'll you'll have to say something like I appreciate our work together, but you're getting into a realm [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6463.18s)]
*  That's that I'm not willing to share with you. Oh, so you got it. I thought it'd be more subtle [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6468.04s)]
*  You basically just tell them no, I mean that's pretty subtle in our world [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6471.7s)]
*  Right in our world subtle is I have professional obligations that prevent me from going down this road what's not subtle [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6475.0s)]
*  So you had to say that to him and then does he smile and go you knew what I was doing [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6487.52s)]
*  Is there like a little gamesmanship? There's some game not with it. Not with Masad Masad is [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6491.92s)]
*  Business the Russians [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6497.64s)]
*  There's gamesmanship because the Russians are thinking this the Russians are thinking you say no today [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6499.64s)]
*  But tomorrow [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6504.56s)]
*  And also we've been doing this with debt for decades with the Russians right there is it is a dance [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6507.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, okay. All right hat now [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6512.120000000001s)]
*  I imagine you've also tried to do this with others others and did you do the same tactic? [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6514.42s)]
*  Do you guys have this victory and then all of a sudden you pull them aside? [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6520.320000000001s)]
*  No, that's so the American tactic is very different than a lot of other tactics. Okay, what's the American? [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6523.56s)]
*  We are personal right out of chair. You just share memes all the time [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6529.84s)]
*  Okay, so wait wait your personal time. What does that mean? So that means right out of it [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6534.8s)]
*  So can you give us an example after CIA that you can talk about it? [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6538.56s)]
*  Yes, I can talk about it. So same private contract in the Middle East [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6542.8s)]
*  Yeah, I needed to bring over a reporting source for my contractor for my for my [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6546.400000000001s)]
*  Contract holder a reporting source means an intelligence source in the private world [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6551.6s)]
*  So you need a private intelligence source from another contractor and you need to bring them over from a foreign country and they're professional [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6556.04s)]
*  This is what they do for a living and you got to break them. Yes exactly right [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6563.78s)]
*  Except oftentimes you're not trying to break anybody. What does that mean? Because you're not trying to you're at [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6569.099999999999s)]
*  Our way of doing things right the best practice in the United States is that you're not trying to break someone's will [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6574.7s)]
*  You're not trying to trick them or dupe them. How do we operate with incentives scratch my back? I scratch yours [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6579.98s)]
*  Is it yeah only my scratch is better. Yeah, I got you right now [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6585.86s)]
*  So they don't even think that they have become a double agent they [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6589.62s)]
*  Are you they are grasping with that they they are stay or professionals? [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6596.5s)]
*  So they know that's what they're being asked to do [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6601.22s)]
*  But at the same time they're like I'm getting this information which my people might like or more importantly [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6602.74s)]
*  They're thinking I'm getting this other Benny that my people don't even have to know about [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6607.62s)]
*  Wait, oh, okay. So take us through. Okay, so you got your target [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6611.5s)]
*  Yeah, are there multiple and you lock in on one or it was it always one for the whole time? [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6615.22s)]
*  So usually what it is is you have a target but the target that you want is not reachable [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6619.22s)]
*  Because the target that you want is never gonna convert [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6623.860000000001s)]
*  So you end up pursuing that target to find out who their network of close associates are so then you can peel off [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6627.02s)]
*  It's like trying to get a mob bus and then you just get the other guy to snitch, right? [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6632.780000000001s)]
*  So that's more of how it actually works and then when you actually find your way to the associate [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6636.38s)]
*  Ideally the associate has the ear of the primary target. So now by influencing the associate you influence the primary. Okay [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6640.46s)]
*  So tell me how you did so then when you approach the associate the associate is trained [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6646.9s)]
*  But the associate also has their own challenges because they give me the story [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6650.179999999999s)]
*  Can you give me the story about how it happened? I can give you that's still in the air [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6653.66s)]
*  But I can give you some of it, right? So I approached my my associate you guys are already have a rapport [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6657.82s)]
*  You're already working together [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6663.62s)]
*  Well, I mean day one day one as soon as I know this is the person that I think is gonna get me connected to the [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6664.54s)]
*  Perth to the to the main target. Yeah, I'm not keeping it professional. I'm I am making it personal [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6669.54s)]
*  Different than Masad Masad wants to keep it professional until there's a reason to make it personal [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6675.26s)]
*  Our process is different because our process has to fit our culture and what people stereotypically [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6680.0599999999995s)]
*  Okay, so what will you do? What would you we got to come over for dinner? [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6685.42s)]
*  Come over for a barbecue come meet my kids come you'll use your family your whole your whole world is yours, man [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6688.58s)]
*  Yes, and there's no guilt in that there's no fear. There's fear but there's I mean you can control the fear [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6695.099999999999s)]
*  You can control your security but the guilt part isn't really this is a foreigner. Okay. Okay, keep going keep right [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6701.82s)]
*  So then right away you're like, hey, let's let's find a way to bond over something [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6706.3s)]
*  easy and [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6711.34s)]
*  surface level [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6713.0599999999995s)]
*  basketball football golf women [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6714.3s)]
*  booze whatever else especially when you're talking to a foreigner because foreigners have much less like brain [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6716.62s)]
*  Well [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6722.86s)]
*  Less [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6725.7s)]
*  Sensitivities and a lot of Americans do because we are a Christian culture, you know at that heart [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6726.9s)]
*  Yeah, so it's much easier to be like, hey, what do you like to do? [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6731.66s)]
*  And they're like I like to gamble I like to bet big and lose big and you're like [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6734.26s)]
*  Well, then let's go do the thing right and then when you're there and they lose their ass [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6737.74s)]
*  Then you step in and you're like man, you've got better luck than me because I lost my ass two hours ago [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6742.3s)]
*  So let's put another 500 on you and then you you start to show them that you're a good time [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6746.86s)]
*  You start to do all the same shit that you were saying earlier [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6751.82s)]
*  You were like I like you now and I trust you now like you know [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6754.3s)]
*  Also, if you're bringing them to your wife to your family your wife knows what time it is [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6757.34s)]
*  She's oh, yeah, she's an operative to see y'all are firing on all silicon, right? [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6760.9s)]
*  So that's how you and now remember we're talking to about a trained professional on the other side cuz they know [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6764.86s)]
*  So that trained professional the other side knows who you are and they know what you did [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6769.7s)]
*  Especially me when I left CIA I've been overt ever since I left so they know I'm formerly trained CIA [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6773.78s)]
*  They knew when I was in Abu Dhabi that that's what I was there to do [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6779.099999999999s)]
*  I was there in an intelligence capacity. I was there supporting a private contract [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6781.98s)]
*  How the fuck do you still get them? [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6785.259999999999s)]
*  Because they want something more [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6786.54s)]
*  You keep in mind secrets are a commodity [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6788.94s)]
*  What they want something more meaning it's a personal thing or they representing their country want something more [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6791.9s)]
*  They personal they want a gamble. They want drugs. They want women. They want they have a vice [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6798.139999999999s)]
*  They want money because they're work. They've been busting their ass their whole life for a government wage [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6802.78s)]
*  They've got kids that have [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6808.299999999999s)]
*  Medical issues that can't be treated in their home country. You'll find out all about all those things [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6810.62s)]
*  Yeah, because what happens is when we take it when you make it personal right away [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6815.58s)]
*  When you make it personal right away [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6819.5s)]
*  You break down all those contrived barriers of what we can't I can't talk about and you just go to your employer and be like [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6820.86s)]
*  Yo, give me X amount of money and we can get whatever you need. Sorry real quick. It can't be [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6825.94s)]
*  Hey, here's money straight up right they have to trust that you would give them money. No strings attached, right? [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6830.139999999999s)]
*  It's not even just about money it's about that you are the solution provider [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6835.5s)]
*  Right, my kid has an illness. Yeah, I don't have to give them money to have them treat their kids illness [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6841.5s)]
*  I can make a call to a buddy who's a doctor in my again and you just have to take your kids to what you were saying [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6846.66s)]
*  It's not about the money. It's about what the money buys what it does [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6853.46s)]
*  So I've heard this with like different operatives words like oh they found out they're a huge football fan [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6855.5s)]
*  Mmm, and they're like dude [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6859.82s)]
*  I actually have a jersey like a patriot signed jersey like you should you should have it [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6861.06s)]
*  They'll give them something like that. Yep, hypothetically. Let's say you found out someone was a huge fan of stand-up comedy [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6864.74s)]
*  Let's say they loved Andrew Schultz. Okay, let's say loved Akash. Okay, how could you leverage that into getting what you want? [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6870.5s)]
*  So if I know they're a big well, first of all, if they're a big fan of your types of comedy, yeah, they're good guys [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6877.46s)]
*  But I know a lot about them. You guys have a very unique style sexual deviance [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6883.62s)]
*  So that tells us a lot but then what I can't interesting yeah, so it's super important yeah [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6895.219999999999s)]
*  What we can do is I can say that I have a client [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6901.78s)]
*  That has front-row seats to Andrew's next show but the client can't make it [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6906.3s)]
*  So I've got these three tickets that are burning a hole in my pocket [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6911.179999999999s)]
*  Do you want to come out come and then do you want to bring your wife or do you want me to find? [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6913.62s)]
*  Like a cute lady to come with us. Oh [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6917.62s)]
*  Now would you buy the tickets outright? Yeah with the money or would you go to Schultz be like, yo [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6920.62s)]
*  Can we get some tickets for the thing? Maybe do a meet-and-greet one? [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6924.82s)]
*  So the reason I wouldn't right now from today forward today forward that makes me a story [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6927.22s)]
*  Yes, the reason I wouldn't do that is because now I put a bookmark in his mind [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6933.14s)]
*  Yeah, why did Andy want three free tickets, right? Why do you want to be comped? [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6936.34s)]
*  If I come to him and I'm like, I want two tickets [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6940.74s)]
*  He might be like us for you and your wife and then he's gonna look for me at the show [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6942.9s)]
*  But instead it's much easier just go fucking ticket by office and buy three tickets on a throwaway credit card under somebody else's name [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6946.02s)]
*  And then boom, I've got three tickets. He doesn't know to look for me that day [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6952.54s)]
*  I can put on some lame disguise so he doesn't even see me we're good to go, right? [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6955.14s)]
*  But that's that's how it would work to the target. Yeah, if you ask me tickets, I would need information [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6959.62s)]
*  Yeah, I've like I want to know everything. Wait, so you got you got the dude though [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6964.82s)]
*  You got the information from him? We so where I got is I got I got the guy [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6968.7s)]
*  To understand that he was selling his information to my clients through the contractor and that [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6973.94s)]
*  It was a discreet relationship with the contractor and that I was gonna leave and that's that's the ultimate goal for us in [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6981.06s)]
*  The intelligence world the ultimate goal is to get your target to share its information directly with the institution [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6988.06s)]
*  So that you can exit. That's the ultimate and that's the game [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6993.62s)]
*  Worldwide so you don't even want to know the information [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=6997.82s)]
*  You have to in the beginning but the most [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7000.780000000001s)]
*  Everybody who knows the information is a liability in the what we call the chain of acquisition [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7003.820000000001s)]
*  The chain of acquisition of the information. Can you explain why it would be a liability? [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7008.22s)]
*  Because a worst-case scenario with it sure sure so [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7011.9400000000005s)]
*  The asset themselves give you a piece of information. Let's just say it's whatever they give you they give you the can of information [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7015.42s)]
*  Well now they have to give me that same can if I take a sip or if I spill it [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7022.9400000000005s)]
*  It's different and then if I give it to you you might take a sip or you might spill it and then by the time [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7027.94s)]
*  It actually gets to the organization. It's only half full [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7032.7s)]
*  Yeah, guys like you to incorporate espionage in the US that must be a massive thing because information is everything in business and competition [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7035.219999999999s)]
*  So I want to be I'm gonna be very particular about words espionage is illegal [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7042.259999999999s)]
*  okay, everywhere in the world espionage is illegal the only reason that [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7046.219999999999s)]
*  Clandestine CIA officers can participate in espionage is because there's a there's a carve out in the US law [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7049.94s)]
*  that makes it so when you're trained by the US government and [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7058.139999999999s)]
*  Collecting secrets about foreign countries in support of the US government. You won't be prosecuted for espionage [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7061.98s)]
*  Corporate espionage industrial espionage always illegal. There's no carve out to protect those. So what do you call it? So [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7068.299999999999s)]
*  Espionage as you think of it the steel of the definition of espionage is stealing of secrets corporate espionage [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7076.02s)]
*  Shouldn't happen [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7082.860000000001s)]
*  Most stand-up professionals in the intelligence world don't do that because the risk is too high [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7084.860000000001s)]
*  Right if I help Yahoo steal secrets from duck duck go [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7089.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm going to jail for a long time got it [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7094.42s)]
*  So people don't participate in that what they do participate in is private intelligence [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7096.820000000001s)]
*  Private intelligence means finding legal methods in which to collect information that you can use to [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7101.46s)]
*  Create an analysis or an assessment. So now if I want to do an analysis of Verizon in support of [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7106.660000000001s)]
*  AT&T I can find multiple legal ways to collect data about Verizon [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7114.58s)]
*  I can then compile it using proprietary methods that creates an assessment for AT&T [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7119.1s)]
*  two very different things [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7124.58s)]
*  Why don't you just target the higher-ups at all the fortune 500s and then do insider trading get rich and [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7126.46s)]
*  Sail off into the sunset. It's that's a lot more work than you would think [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7133.18s)]
*  First of all, and secondly the higher-ups and a lot of those organizations, they don't actually carry the the decision-making [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7137.3s)]
*  I mean well target someone who would be the decision-maker and then like the boy trade like Nancy Pelosi [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7143.7s)]
*  Which is and that so that's that is essentially who does that? [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7150.38s)]
*  It's the boards of directors are in those large companies that usually have that kind of insight because they're the ones that make the decision [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7153.98s)]
*  What doesn't doesn't get approved that the CEO presents? [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7160.099999999999s)]

*  The bigger concern with someone like you is not that you're doing it wittingly. It's that you're doing it unwittingly [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7379.96s)]
*  That you are being used [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7385.5199999999995s)]
*  That's what I think is happening now with you [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7387.599999999999s)]
*  Like I think you got me [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7390.08s)]

*  You responded to what we said on the pod and then I took the bait but I knowingly took the bait [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7394.679999999999s)]
*  So there like this guy's baiting me and then I get him on the pod [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7400.24s)]
*  But then maybe I wanted him on the pond the first place so it's never now. You're the master. Yeah could be it's [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7403.679999999999s)]

*  If you judge him by his nose massage [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7415.08s)]
*  Cuz I've been doing all this Rob Rob America stuff, but maybe that's just to throw the scent off the trail [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7421.44s)]
*  That's true. You you could be you could be really good Latvian intelligence [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7425.5199999999995s)]
*  Is there a country that's really small but has [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7440.4s)]
*  Outside of Israel that you would you were surprised by their level of intelligence [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7444.24s)]
*  Really? [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7450.24s)]
*  Cuba's yep, Cuba's poor Cuba's small Cuba's ostracized their intelligence is [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7451.5199999999995s)]
*  Amazing and how are they getting their intelligence out there in the world? I mean, how do they even get it? [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7457.799999999999s)]
*  Go that well, that's what's so impressive about it, right? [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7463.679999999999s)]
*  What what we've learned to do in the United States is leverage our economic [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7466.16s)]
*  Incentive to get people to spy for us. Cuba leverages almost exclusively ideological [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7470.48s)]
*  Motivations where people feel bad for the plight of Cubans. They feel that like it's a [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7477.2s)]
*  In injustice what's happened to the Cubans and they feel like that poverty is being forced by Western democracy or whatever else [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7485.36s)]
*  So what they're able to do is find sympathists and then cultivate those sympathists to either take positions of government or they have found [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7491.96s)]
*  Sympathists already in positions in government and then can boost them up the item on test and a monster [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7500.76s)]
*  Yeah, perfect example [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7506.24s)]
*  the the Anna Montez case is really interesting because Anna Montez was working for DIA and [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7507.52s)]
*  Recruited by the Cubans at the same time as another gentleman named William [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7512.8s)]
*  Might be William Burns [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7517.16s)]
*  Who was working for the Department of State and also recruited by the Cubans at the same period of time and this was during the Clinton [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7519.68s)]
*  administration when Clintons all of his foreign policy about Cuba was being dictated by [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7526.72s)]
*  Two spies by two organizations the State Department and the DIA [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7531.92s)]
*  They were already influenced by and those were the leading experts on Cuba [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7536.84s)]
*  so the entire Clinton administration was being essentially directed by the Cubans because of this this perfect [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7540.72s)]
*  Conglomerations perfect triangle of intelligence and when do we find that out? [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7549.02s)]
*  19 I think she was convicted in the early 2000s. Actually, when was Anna Montez convicted? [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7553.38s)]
*  Let me find out now. Okay, he's at office. We were arrested 2001 2001. Okay now [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7559.74s)]
*  Yes, so the damage has already been done. It couldn't be undone because he's already out of years [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7565.42s)]
*  The shoe is involved all eight years theoretically now [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7568.9s)]
*  That's really interesting [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7571.18s)]
*  You don't necessarily need to get your citizens in another country and then trick them into allowing them into government [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7572.06s)]
*  you can get the sympathies in those countries into government and [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7577.78s)]
*  How you probably even see that happening now, right? That's why ideology is the most powerful of all the motors [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7582.58s)]
*  Things about all the things that fall under like religion ideology [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7588.46s)]
*  nationalism ideology academics ideology family ideology [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7593.34s)]
*  Ideology is a super powerful thing man has has any other countries done that to us as well [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7597.139999999999s)]
*  Yes, so the I mean the Russians right the Russians there was a [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7601.86s)]
*  What was that story? There was a guy who's like he was the head of the investigation unit [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7606.5s)]
*  I guess was it in the FBI? [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7614.06s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, you tell the story. Yeah, this is this is I mean [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7616.06s)]
*  I know why we haven't made a movie of it [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7619.42s)]
*  But this should be every one of their movies Robert Hanson and Aldrich Ames again during the Cold War period [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7621.02s)]
*  One was FBI one was CIA and the Russians had recruited them both for upwards of a decade [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7626.26s)]
*  So they were able to even more interesting they were able to collect information on [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7632.86s)]
*  What CIA operations were in Russia and what FBI operations were against Russia in the United States? [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7637.0599999999995s)]
*  while simultaneously being able to influence what because these two [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7643.18s)]
*  Organizations were actually looking into and on top of that the people within those organizations that were hired to look for the mole [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7646.66s)]
*  For the mole. Yep, where them? Yeah, so then these two guys were so senior that when the mole hunt started [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7654.26s)]
*  They're like we'll take a look. They hired the mole. So how does [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7662.34s)]
*  I mean you would think that's such a powerful thing. That's like a good question chessboard. Yeah, how did that work? [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7674.740000000001s)]
*  So how did the US essentially win the Cold War at least that's what I understand the US didn't win the Cold War [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7679.179999999999s)]
*  Russia imploded if you remember the the fall of the Berlin Wall [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7686.099999999999s)]
*  Was the Soviet Union collapsing is that because communism is sustainable or what? [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7690.38s)]
*  I mean a cent the way they were trying the way the USSR was trying to run communism wasn't sustainable [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7695.139999999999s)]
*  And then you doing China's worked out those kinks. I'm very worried about China. You can't tell [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7699.62s)]
*  Just to stay on this one real quick is [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7704.46s)]
*  You I think the CIA [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7707.22s)]
*  had implemented a [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7710.46s)]
*  Like economic deployment a block. No, not it not even a block. I think they were deploying resources [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7713.66s)]
*  To like American what was it impressionist art? No, it was a postmodern postmodern [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7721.9800000000005s)]
*  I like they were deploying capital to bolster Western [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7727.9s)]
*  Ideology and artistic expression so there was like [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7732.139999999999s)]
*  There was a there was a move to I guess what supports certain cultural institutions in America and make them seem more [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7737.259999999999s)]
*  Successful than they really were correct [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7744.54s)]
*  So again what you're getting at is a lot of what defined the pre-911 CIA got it which was spaghetti on a wall [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7746.7s)]
*  Oh, just try anything try anything [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7753.58s)]
*  And it's very difficult to quantify the value of any of those things right like pouring a bunch of money into [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7757.12s)]
*  Postmodernist art done by Spanish artists in Barcelona. This is funny, right? This is let's try it in retrospect [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7763.96s)]
*  We're like it was the most genius way. Yeah, I did nothing [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7770.68s)]
*  Not that we could measure maybe it was the game changer MK ultra same thing same thing [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7773.64s)]
*  I'm getting K. Ultra those things where it's like hey the bad guys are doing it. We should do it, too [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7778.72s)]
*  How do we measure the success? I don't want to him before 9-11 project oversight [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7781.96s)]
*  So you guys could just throw anything at the project star great, right? [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7785.96s)]
*  Remote viewers and and trying to like use LSD to be able to like hack into people's brains the bad guys are doing it [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7789.2s)]
*  We should do it, too. How do we measure it? I want to go into MK ultra and project target, but also real quick [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7795.92s)]
*  Just back to to CIA spending [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7801.32s)]
*  That's what some people say the space race was about right [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7804.76s)]
*  Bankrupting Russia and it was did that lead to the implosion of Russia? [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7808.4800000000005s)]
*  It was part of it the thing that backfired is that Russia beat us in the space race in two out of I think [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7811.64s)]
*  Four categories, yeah, they got there at first. They're the first spacewalk [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7817.88s)]
*  They did first spacewalk, but they didn't hit the moon correct, but they didn't get to the moon [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7821.92s)]
*  That's right, and their spaceships were fucking insane. Did you see the thing like it was a crapshoot? [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7826.04s)]
*  The things that they were setting up there [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7832.400000000001s)]
*  The fact that the any of them worked the first guy forget the guy's name the balls on this guy [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7835.120000000001s)]
*  Yuri, what was it Yuri? I forget his last name right now [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7841.38s)]
*  I mean, they're literally just going we need to beat the Americans send anything out there anything trash cans with duct tape, dude [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7844.78s)]
*  You're a good garden. Thank you. Yes [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7851.179999999999s)]
*  So that I mean is that true that America was funding or the CIA was funding this space race in an effort to make Russia? [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7853.62s)]
*  economically [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7862.0599999999995s)]
*  Unsustainable I don't I mean it it's it is a very plausible theory. I wouldn't call that a conspiracy theory [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7863.179999999999s)]
*  I would call that a very plausible theory [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7868.54s)]
*  Because it makes sense [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7870.42s)]
*  CIA maintains a black budget. That's a covert budget and that the way that that covert budget is appropriated is [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7871.98s)]
*  Through things that where there's extra money [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7879.3s)]
*  There's extra money that the budget can't account for that like your bean counters in Washington can't account for so they put it in the black [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7882.22s)]
*  Budget so that CIA can use it for national security reasons [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7887.82s)]
*  Oh, so you basically have a big deep black check a big date a deep blank check [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7889.98s)]
*  To do all sorts of crazy shit [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7895.66s)]
*  In the wall, that's the spaghetti now [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7898.3s)]
*  Do you think that was more effective or less because I hear you say the new CIA isn't that great either right? [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7899.42s)]
*  Or they're just elements of both. What do you prefer the old pre-9-eleven or post-9-eleven? [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7905.14s)]
*  No post-9-eleven [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7909.42s)]
*  I prefer much much better because the post-9-eleven one you have checks and balances to confirm that what they're doing doesn't hurt Americans [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7910.58s)]
*  Okay pre-9-eleven [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7916.46s)]
*  All sorts of shit could happen. Yeah, and you wouldn't have any idea if it's affecting Americans, right? [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7918.46s)]
*  So post-9-eleven I think is far better than that. However, we've also lost our tolerance for risk and [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7922.34s)]
*  When you're asking how do people in the CIA view me? [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7927.38s)]
*  Like it's a split decision because there's a lot of people at CIA who are trying their best to do a good job who know [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7930.7s)]
*  CIA is no longer taking risks [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7937.66s)]
*  They're afraid to take certain risk because they're afraid that some congressmen or some senator is gonna say no and someone's gonna lose their job [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7939.26s)]
*  And then they're gonna lose their pension [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7945.8s)]
*  so you've got a bunch of junior officers who are like we need to try something new and a bunch of senior officers who are like [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7947.46s)]
*  we need to fill the box with exactly what we know that can't does said it is tricky because [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7952.3s)]
*  You're operating in the most high stakes game. So the risk requires incredible accountability, right? [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7957.900000000001s)]
*  And the risks are not even to you [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7965.02s)]
*  Right like in intelligence I may take the risk to collect the secret [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7967.5s)]
*  But the longer that secret the longer that secret is protected all of us are at risk. It's almost like a man [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7971.74s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, what did you mean by that? [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7977.42s)]
*  Because if somebody else is holding a secret that they know about us that I can't collect [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7978.54s)]
*  To collect it. I put myself at risk if I don't try to collect it [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7983.72s)]
*  We put all of us so you're saying you it's it's more beneficial [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7987.58s)]
*  It would behoove us to take more recipes that actually keeps us all safe [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7990.62s)]
*  The risk so what would a risk be that you would have to take that people are a little bit concerned about doing so [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=7993.46s)]
*  For example, right if you had [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8002.02s)]
*  If you had a big negotiation coming up between for agriculture [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8004.3s)]
*  and I bring this up a lot because you'd be shocked how much espionage has to do with [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8007.700000000001s)]
*  Being able to anticipate agricultural trading if you think about what's happening in the Black Sea right now [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8011.820000000001s)]
*  I was just all about it with Ukraine, right? Yep. So [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8016.1s)]
*  so when it comes to agriculture the idea of [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8020.780000000001s)]
*  Let's say Obama got egg on his face because the NSA was caught collecting secrets about agriculture on Angela Merkel in Germany [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8023.3s)]
*  That's right [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8031.3s)]
*  I remember that and it was such a weird thing because we're like why would we collecting series from? [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8032.22s)]
*  Secrets from like one of our allies Germany is not telling not being transparent about their trade policy with a common third country [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8037.780000000001s)]
*  So we have to collect from Germany and collect from our target third country to see if the two countries are telling us the truth [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8045.12s)]
*  About each other and they weren't correct. So he was right to do it correct [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8051.62s)]
*  So he didn't really get fucking egg in his face [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8054.46s)]
*  Except that it did massive damage to the German US patch [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8056.84s)]
*  To me I'm like that's on you like if it if it go on go on [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8060.92s)]
*  I mean, I understand what you're saying. Yeah, I just saying that's the American point of view to NATO [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8064.84s)]
*  NATO was like what the fuck how dare you spy on it now? [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8069.6s)]
*  Germany is the economic engine of all of Europe. Yeah, and now you just pissed them off. Okay. Okay, so but continue [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8072.28s)]
*  So that's that's kind of how it works [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8079.0s)]
*  So the the the kind of risks that you need to take are the risks that [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8080.56s)]
*  There's going to be some kind of flap that makes a rift between the deck that [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8085.64s)]
*  diplomatic relationships between two countries that are supposed to be strong and everybody's worried about losing their fucking job because if they turns out that the [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8090.4400000000005s)]
*  Intelligence doesn't really support anything now [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8098.88s)]
*  We took this big risk to piss off Great Britain or Chris piss off Germany or piss off Canada one of our allies and we got [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8101.22s)]
*  Nothing from it you get canned right and and and that's Europe when you're talking about [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8106.360000000001s)]
*  Latin America or Africa now you're talking about like we pissed off the warlord and now they're taking the BNI instead and now we've completely [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8110.5199999999995s)]
*  Lost access to China's like we're not gonna do that to you, right? Yeah, we're gonna play nice [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8116.679999999999s)]
*  I'm like America. Yeah, and then we lose all of our global influence and not to mention big risk [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8120.12s)]
*  We force I'm sorry. I just hit our mic go and then not to mention we force our we force our ideology into the countries [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8124.839999999999s)]
*  So we're like hey Mogadishu. We'd love to help you. You need to have free and fair elections [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8131.0s)]
*  You are not a democratically elected president [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8135.919999999999s)]
*  You need to create a schedule of elections and you need to find a way to make sure that your voters can all vote equally [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8139.24s)]
*  And then meanwhile that same warlord has the Chinese going up and being like we don't we don't change shit [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8144.48s)]
*  Fuck what you just need to report you just need to sign on the dotted line here that we have access for the next 99 [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8149.96s)]
*  Year, why is that so important to us that we push our ideology easier to control? [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8154.76s)]
*  It's it is our post-world war two strategy coming out of world war two [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8158.8s)]
*  Remember the United States was pretty much untouched. Yeah or two if anything our economic [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8163.24s)]
*  Yeah, our economy exploded. Yeah [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8168.48s)]
*  Germany France Poland reeling destroyed. Yeah, like [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8171.32s)]
*  Industrially and architecturally destroyed. Yeah, so we went in there and we were like hey [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8176.0s)]
*  We have plenty of money to give you loans [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8180.0s)]
*  We have plenty of infrastructure to come in and start building immediately [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8182.0s)]
*  But in order to get access to that money and access to this you have to follow these guidelines and then we became [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8185.2s)]
*  The leader of the democratic world, right? Why why did we feel like that was advantageous? [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8191.099999999999s)]
*  Russia maybe so we thought was it was economically advantageous because we knew that by rebuilding these countries [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8196.08s)]
*  Oh, no that part that makes sense. But why pushing ideology? [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8202.36s)]
*  Why was the ideology the rice thing where just control? [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8205.64s)]
*  Yeah, the G is the strongest correct. It's it's so we can control your ideology. We can control your everything, right? [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8208.6s)]
*  Got it. I see us and we're essentially we're essentially [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8214.28s)]
*  Programming into the new economy a reliance on the United States. Yeah [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8218.56s)]
*  Oh [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8222.92s)]
*  Brilliant really fuck. Yep, and guess who's following that model now China [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8224.439999999999s)]
*  They are programming into these economies that they are putting money that they are now reliant on China [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8230.359999999999s)]
*  That's what we've been doing. And this is I love my country. I love the CIA [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8236.88s)]
*  This is how it works. This is best practice. This is the game. This is the game if you don't like it, that's fine [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8242.039999999999s)]
*  It's still the game whether you like it or not [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8248.76s)]
*  And it's the game that we mastered and it's the game that that we have now been playing for so long [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8250.84s)]
*  That somebody else has been watching our tape just like you watch the rival football team's tape [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8256.2s)]
*  That's and now they're like, I think we know how to do it better. I'm listening [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8260.26s)]
*  You know you talked about when you're young you have a big tolerance for risk and then as you get older not so much [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8265.960000000001s)]
*  It's almost like the US as a young country took on all the risks CIA throw spaghetti at the wall [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8271.640000000001s)]
*  Here's the money gives a fuck as the US gets older more security now. We're like, yo chill everybody [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8276.640000000001s)]
*  Let's just keep things the way they are [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8282.48s)]
*  I don't want to take also when you're in you know our detriment when you got the top spot [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8283.56s)]
*  There's only one place to go. So everything feels like risk. It's true. That's when you're coming up. It's like, yeah [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8286.6s)]
*  This was worth it. We could get the top spot. I'm gonna lose so again [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8290.720000000001s)]
*  So so democracy pushing democracy pushing ideology is a is a form of control in that [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8293.42s)]
*  Not only do we control what they believe in but we can control the way that they operate [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8300.16s)]
*  Commercially, is that the idea? Yes [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8305.68s)]
*  I mean you can how does the democracy create the reliance on the US outside of the loan? [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8307.68s)]
*  Because if you want a certain if we as America want a certain political power to win in an election [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8312.56s)]
*  We can come in and say we believe in this person. Not that other person. Yeah, right [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8318.6s)]
*  We've done that before we will we will give more foreign aid because this person is such a strong democratic leader [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8323.16s)]
*  But if you vote for that person, we're gonna have to pull back our foreign aid, right? [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8328.56s)]
*  It's exactly what we did in with Hamas in [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8331.84s)]
*  In Palestine, right? [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8335.08s)]
*  We we said we will support the Palestinian people in Gaza. Mm-hmm [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8337.08s)]
*  and then we reclassified Hamas as a [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8341.72s)]
*  Terrorist group again, right we declassified them in [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8345.48s)]
*  2019 reclassified them in [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8349.039999999999s)]
*  2024 as a terrorist group and then once we reclassified them we pulled money out because we can't support a terrorist group [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8351.519999999999s)]
*  But we didn't define them as terrorist group [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8358.359999999999s)]
*  No, what I'm saying is we do it in order to and I imagine other countries also were like well [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8360.359999999999s)]
*  I can't be supporting a terrorist group. That's what we I think that's what our strategy in [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8364.08s)]
*  Conjunction with Israel was hoping for but instead what happened is many of our closest European allies were like that's fucked up America [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8368.119999999999s)]
*  We're gonna double down and put more money in Turkey France. Wow [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8374.759999999998s)]
*  They kept it going and now that's why you see the Biden administration where they are now [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8380.0s)]
*  Bound up because now they're like well shit [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8384.039999999999s)]
*  We took we called them terrorists we took back money and people are still dying and Netanyahu still going crazy [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8387.0s)]
*  So what do we do now now? [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8392.72s)]
*  There's a split between Netanyahu and Biden now [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8394.759999999998s)]
*  They're talking to the opposition parties in Israel to see if they can find a way to make us a ceasefire of some sort [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8397.16s)]
*  Right. I mean it's today is the second day of Ramadan [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8402.82s)]
*  Which is one of the largest Muslim holidays and there was supposed to be a ceasefire [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8406.48s)]
*  Orchestrated to bring to help kind of honor this holiday and instead it's not happening. What do you think happens? [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8411.519999999999s)]
*  in Israel Palestine [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8418.359999999999s)]
*  so I mean [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8421.4s)]
*  For all the concerns that people had about Putin being ousted during his war in Ukraine [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8423.279999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu is at way more risk than Putin ever was really because Israel is a functioning democracy, right? [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8428.839999999998s)]
*  Right, the people actually have a say. Yeah, there's relative transparency there [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8434.88s)]
*  They already have people calling for reelection. They already have opposition leaders being welcomed and acknowledged in the West [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8438.96s)]
*  Like Netanyahu's in a nasty place really to be is there not support for BB in in Israel right now [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8446.119999999999s)]
*  There is support but it's a very narrow far-right support got it where most of the country has taken a very moderate [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8451.48s)]
*  Oh, I thought that the war kind of unified the country behind it for the first temporarily similar to 9-eleven [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8459.0s)]
*  Protests are coming. Oh and now they're starting to come back interesting [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8464.48s)]
*  So he's what's a member 9-eleven how we all got along to me and then eventually it's very quickly doing that [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8467.52s)]
*  What the fuck we doing we saw than ever so it's almost like you have a small window to get done what you need to [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8472.48s)]
*  Get done where you have full support and the longer that window lasts [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8476.960000000001s)]
*  The riskier your position is and we learned that lesson after 9-eleven, which is why the Americans went out and said [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8480.800000000001s)]
*  Hey, you know Israel you have had an injustice done [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8488.48s)]
*  Don't do the air raids that you're planning don't make the mistake that we made [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8492.72s)]
*  Interesting, but it was a political opportunity for Netanyahu to consolidate power [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8499.039999999999s)]
*  In a time when there was already divisiveness about whether or not the country liked him or not and as a result to your point [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8504.72s)]
*  Hamas is now more popular with stronger support in both Gaza and the West Bank than ever before [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8511.56s)]
*  Because people there is absolutely a difference between a Palestinian and a Hamas terrorist [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8517.28s)]
*  They are not the same thing. Yes, but because the media for so long has called them the same thing [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8524.28s)]
*  Have you have used the two words interchangeably? Yeah now it's common knowledge [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8530.08s)]
*  If you look at the news a week after [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8534.880000000001s)]
*  October 8th when the attack happened you would see the news say [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8539.36s)]
*  You would see the news say [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8543.240000000002s)]
*  11,000 people have been killed in Palestine according to Hamas authorities [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8545.52s)]
*  And then you would see a little disclaimer at the bottom that says Hamas controls the Gaza. So the health into the health [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8549.320000000002s)]
*  Whatever comes from them, right? [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8555.880000000001s)]
*  So it basically saying don't trust this information because it comes from Hamas when you look at the same thing now [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8557.84s)]
*  It'll say 30,000 people have been killed according to with the Palestinian Health Authority. Oh [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8562.400000000001s)]
*  so we have just [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8568.6s)]
*  Validated that Hamas who we are also calling a terrorist organization is a valid government organization [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8570.84s)]
*  oh, and it's tricky because they've always been the [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8577.4s)]
*  The appointed political power in Gaza since 2007. So they have been that but because we've been so shitty with our [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8582.0s)]
*  vernacular in our terminology [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8590.36s)]
*  We've let the waters get foggy and now it's very difficult to teach people the truth [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8592.08s)]
*  Well, I think we've questioned whether or not they were actually democratically elected right that was my man [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8598.12s)]
*  Yeah, there's there's very little evidence to say they were democratically elected [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8602.12s)]
*  Yeah, but it's also because they're because of the apartheid that's been practiced in in Palestine [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8605.400000000001s)]
*  Territory for so long. There's a question of whether or not they could even have a democratic election. Yeah [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8611.240000000002s)]
*  But it's the the fact that they're growing in popularity in the West Bank is the part that's so interesting because the West Bank has always [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8617.08s)]
*  been a [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8622.160000000002s)]
*  US backed coalition of the Fatah government. Yeah, even that is falling apart. So what do you think happens? [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8623.28s)]
*  Do you think BB gets ousted? I? [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8630.0s)]
*  Don't I I would imagine in Israel either a ceasefire is called that gets prolonged [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8632.56s)]
*  While some new normal takes place and a two-state solution comes back on the table [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8639.52s)]
*  Hmm, that's the most likely thing that's gonna happen whether that happens soon or not [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8645.119999999999s)]
*  I don't know whether we're talking months or years [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8649.78s)]
*  But for Netanyahu to remain in power [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8652.06s)]
*  He's gonna have to call a ceasefire and then work through a ceasefire [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8654.42s)]
*  Same thing is gonna happen in Ukraine Ukraine and Israel are gonna look very similar from this point forward in what way because the [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8657.78s)]
*  the aggressor or the the [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8665.3s)]
*  US-backed country [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8668.7s)]
*  Ukraine and Israel have both made promises that they can't maintain [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8670.46s)]
*  There's no way Zelensky is gonna win this war to the point where all of the pre-soviet era [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8675.74s)]
*  Boundaries of Ukraine are returned to Ukraine. So now the decision is just how many people are gonna die [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8680.5s)]
*  Yeah [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8684.179999999998s)]
*  This is the decisions how many people are gonna die before you call a ceasefire and basically cut the country in half according to the borders [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8684.699999999999s)]
*  That are already there. Yep in Israel [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8689.5s)]
*  Like Netanyahu's promise that he's gonna occupy Palestinian lands once they are done clearing cleansing the people of Hamas, right? [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8692.259999999998s)]
*  That's not gonna happen. You're not gonna cleanse them of Hamas [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8701.179999999998s)]
*  Like you've created an injustice Hamas is always gonna be there and then if you do occupy Palestinian lands [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8703.34s)]
*  There's still Palestinian lands and now you're gonna have even more impetus for Palestinians to join Hamas and fight back against [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8708.98s)]
*  Against Israeli occupation. So both of those leaders are gonna find they can't fulfill their promise [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8714.98s)]
*  The next best thing to fulfilling your promise is essentially to find some kind of prolonged stalemate [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8719.66s)]
*  That gives the world a chance to reset with a different disaster that takes the attention off of you [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8724.42s)]
*  And then once that different disaster comes in, what do you do? [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8729.34s)]
*  Then for those countries they're off the X now [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8733.34s)]
*  Yeah off the X meaning not everybody's watching them and then while they're not watching them [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8735.779999999999s)]
*  Do they try to find some sort of solution and then everybody's got their tail tucked between their legs? [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8740.1s)]
*  But it doesn't matter because nobody's looking frankly [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8744.6s)]
*  What I think is gonna happen is Zelinsky and Netanyahu are gonna get political sanctuary asylum in the United States [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8746.779999999999s)]
*  Because think about the United States can't let Zelinsky die they cannot do it [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8754.02s)]
*  He's the he's the voice of democracy in Europe and [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8757.82s)]
*  Everybody knows Putin wants to kill him because that's gonna be a fantastic win for Putin [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8761.3s)]
*  It was killed at least two other opponents in the last three years, right? [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8765.18s)]
*  So Zelinsky already if he hasn't already signed the deal it's coming his way soon [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8768.34s)]
*  He will get asylum in the United States and he'll be a leader ex communicato, right? [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8773.1s)]
*  And and that's that's the leads of the country when he's gone [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8777.34s)]
*  It's gonna be a shadow puppet government for for Russia or it's gonna be a puppet government for NATO one way or the other [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8781.06s)]
*  So Ukraine and Israel are begging China to invade Taiwan correct? They're like do it tomorrow [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8786.18s)]
*  Yep [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8793.02s)]
*  So that we could settle our ship without the X on our back and China's sitting here watching the whole thing go in [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8793.52s)]
*  America's running out of money [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8799.02s)]
*  America's already out of ammunition NATO is torn on war in Europe. It's time to dance [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8800.82s)]
*  Nobody cares about what's happening out here in the South except one thing [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8806.58s)]
*  The company that is putting the stock market on its back happens to be a Taiwanese company and [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8811.16s)]
*  We will not let anything happen to Nvidia [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8818.44s)]
*  So what they gotta do is get Nvidia the fuck out of Taiwan if China was like I'll take the entire [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8821.64s)]
*  Company and I'll just move it to Palo Alto. I think that it might work [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8825.96s)]
*  So what's funny is Nvidia is the AI country is the AI company? [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8829.859999999999s)]
*  But it's built on the back of TMSC, which is semiconductor company and that is that's [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8834.48s)]
*  in Taiwan [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8840.44s)]
*  Yep, so so TMSC it's the semiconductors in Taiwan that are the key to the future [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8841.44s)]
*  And that's why we're protecting them correct if China if China can find a way to get their hands on a functioning working semiconductor industry [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8847.08s)]
*  Then that's going to massively increase their ability to be a technological opponent [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8855.0s)]
*  right a tech alternative to the United States and [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8860.16s)]
*  The first thing they do is cut off supply to the United States or start to heavily tax it or more [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8863.4s)]
*  Put tariffs on it but Taiwan for some reason is just so far ahead of everyone else when it comes to the chip [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8867.84s)]
*  Did they do that on purpose? Yeah, like how did this happen in the United States? So we when we were doing these like [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8872.960000000001s)]
*  Experiments with newly industrialized nations, right? It was Taiwan [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8879.16s)]
*  There's a few others out there in Asia as well. And what was that was our foreign policy to show? [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8882.04s)]
*  Hey, listen, if you're cozy with America, look how good it can be and because what was our strategy? [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8886.320000000002s)]
*  Create something that makes the industry of that country dependent on America [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8891.560000000001s)]
*  So we create on China because that's how we have some influence and control out there and at the time [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8896.4s)]
*  Who had all the demand for semiconductors? We did cuz we're the only country creating high-tech. Yeah [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8901.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, and what could we not do in our country create like pollution and [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8906.4s)]
*  There it is [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8912.08s)]
*  Outsource all of your yeah. Yeah. Yeah outsource all the issues Greta Thunberg is gonna complain about [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8914.52s)]
*  Yeah [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8920.32s)]
*  Build up the industry of another country right next to one of your potential adversaries at the time China was an ally [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8921.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, wait, wait, really? Yeah, that's right. Cuz they're they're making all the shit that we're buying, right? [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8927.6s)]
*  So we didn't even foresee and we do we have military bases in Taiwan right now [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8932.0s)]
*  We don't have military bases in Taiwan. We have military bases across the South Pacific, but Taiwanese military bases are [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8935.84s)]
*  They are they're shared. So like American planes and jets can land on those bases with Taiwanese permission [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8943.2s)]
*  Unplanned unannounced kind of thing. I'm very impressed with your political knowledge. I don't know shit, man [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8949.92s)]
*  This is this mark. I have to explain. That's why Alden wants to raise a trillion dollars to [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8955.92s)]
*  Get the semiconductor production over here. So 2031 China is like at the same level as America and now that [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8960.039999999999s)]
*  When all of our attention is on China [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8970.88s)]
*  What do you think happens with the race relations here in America? [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8972.88s)]
*  Because we have so many Chinese Americans and you said Chinese people are China first so like what's gonna happen here? [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8975.68s)]
*  It's it's an interesting question Alex thinks every Chinatown is a [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8983.32s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. I mean this man's a genius [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8988.4s)]
*  Every inside what the fuck [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=8991.8s)]
*  Go on go on go now he's been dying on this cross. So this is gonna be glad to hear [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9001.32s)]
*  Tell us tell us tell us so you're right. So so essentially the way that the way that diaspora communities [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9007.519999999999s)]
*  Insulate intelligence collection is that the intelligence collection [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9015.72s)]
*  Facilities or the intelligence collection agencies plant themselves in the diaspora [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9019.720000000001s)]
*  So a Chinatown is a diaspora of Chinese immigrants in a foreign country [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9024.12s)]
*  So the intelligence community just plants its own operatives inside that community. It's not like the community is there for intelligence purposes [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9028.2s)]
*  It's not even like the community. Yeah, not even like the community knows that there's intelligence to cover [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9034.92s)]
*  It's just a very convenient entry point. That's what we call a beachhead [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9039.560000000001s)]
*  It's a very convenient beachhead beachhead for for an opponent force to insulate itself from local law and do we have beachheads in other places? [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9042.92s)]
*  It's tougher because it first of all in the United States. We don't have to we don't create diaspora communities [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9050.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we create expats. Yeah, who are who in who? [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9056.56s)]
*  Acculturates the local community, but they're still Americans. Yeah, and we don't really have to hide because we can just be like, hey [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9060.12s)]
*  We're coming in to party when we're gonna bring new business and American dollars and everything else and everybody wants us there [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9067.08s)]
*  Yeah, much harder for a foreign country to come in to another foreign country and be like like could you imagine the Chinese? [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9071.78s)]
*  We're like we're here to party and we're bringing Chinese you end with us and like [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9076.980000000001s)]
*  convert that into dollars [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9080.78s)]
*  Yeah, look at tick tock [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9083.58s)]
*  Who who controls China has a 50-year policy, right? [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9086.820000000002s)]
*  Two questions does America have a 50-year policy now [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9092.820000000002s)]
*  So America has been you're saying for the last few hundred years [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9096.42s)]
*  Been curating its policy four years or eight years at a time, correct? [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9101.099999999999s)]
*  I mean that it's mind-boggling that we've even been able to [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9106.779999999999s)]
*  Passive that we got this far but and then what does that speak to does that speak to the the power of capitalism or? [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9110.14s)]
*  democracy like it is [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9115.619999999999s)]
*  Unbelievable that we've been able to compete at the highest level [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9117.3s)]
*  With a new dude in charge every four years [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9120.74s)]
*  You have to think back to the intentions of the founding fathers what the founding fathers put in place was brilliant [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9123.099999999999s)]
*  It was the reason that they're called government servants is because you're supposed to [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9129.08s)]
*  Sacrifice four years of your life. Yeah to go be a government servant because you were in [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9135.88s)]
*  Industry or entertainment or business or something else especially true in Congress. I mean and that's what it was up until like the [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9141.72s)]
*  1950s and then they became these career politicians, but you're right [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9149.64s)]
*  It was like it was some local person from the community was gonna stop his job for two years [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9152.720000000001s)]
*  I think that's why the what is it a house of representatives only a two-year term, right? [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9159.36s)]
*  It's because dude, I can't step away from my farm for six years and do this [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9163.28s)]
*  Yeah, and now that idea is completely gone to the wayside now [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9167.48s)]
*  We have congressmen in place for 13 years 18 years 24 years. Yeah, and who sets the term limits for Congress? [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9171.24s)]
*  Congress [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9179.08s)]
*  So it's not even like that's one of the places where there's a lack of checks and there's no check and balance there [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9180.160000000002s)]
*  What's right? They give themselves a raise. Yep. It's insane. This legislative branch is the least [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9184.84s)]
*  The least checked branch of all of them and the idea is that the check is built within it [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9190.84s)]
*  They're not any one of them have this, you know huge amount of power. Of course, I get that [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9196.560000000001s)]
*  Okay, when you party system, yes, but when they're acting as a collective and they're all incentivized by the same thing [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9201.240000000002s)]
*  There's no check on that [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9208.58s)]
*  So maybe that was the one thing that they missed because I'm sure at the time and the founding fathers creating they're like who the fuck? [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9209.62s)]
*  Would want to be in government even George Washington was like dude just about in slaves is way better [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9214.66s)]
*  He's like fuck all this freedom shit. He said no, I need some new teeth. Yeah, so it's like yeah. Oh, wow [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9220.5s)]
*  That's so interesting. They couldn't fathom that people in a free world would want to govern [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9227.38s)]
*  right so they didn't even put the check into it because it was always supposed to be a position for the [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9232.78s)]
*  Most experienced most elites people with the most to lose because again, that's a fucking great point [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9237.900000000001s)]
*  You had nothing if you were not a landowner. You couldn't even run for office [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9243.78s)]
*  Which which sounds incredibly unfair but understand it was supposed to be representative [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9248.460000000001s)]
*  So the people that were most affected by these laws were the people that did own land, right? [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9254.54s)]
*  Hmm, so in our own this is why I call us like this is why I say that we're in this country [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9260.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's a childish problem that you don't even realize it. Yeah, but it yeah. Hmm [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9266.78s)]
*  Hmm, but we're not the youngest in terms of democracy [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9272.78s)]
*  No, so there are other countries that are way older in terms of their culture [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9275.78s)]
*  But their democracies are much younger. Do they have the same problems? [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9279.66s)]
*  They do in large part because their democracies are modeled off of ours. Yeah, so Taiwan is because we were first [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9282.94s)]
*  We didn't see this problem coming. I don't right Taiwan is a fantastic example January Taiwan had elections [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9288.460000000001s)]
*  The president that was elected was part of the opposition party the separatist party from China and the whole world separate the whole world [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9294.220000000001s)]
*  Like rejoice like oh the new Taiwanese president is an opposition to China [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9300.900000000001s)]
*  The Congress of Taiwan is in favor of reunifying with China [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9305.7s)]
*  Wait a minute the dominant the dominant party in the Congress is pro China [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9311.02s)]
*  The president is anti China. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on is China [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9316.960000000001s)]
*  influencing these [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9321.980000000001s)]
*  elections [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9323.7s)]
*  So there is a way where China can get Taiwan [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9324.900000000001s)]
*  Without even having to invade that's China's way of doing it. Look at what they did in Hong Kong in 2019 [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9330.02s)]
*  Now I would say that was a little more forceful [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9335.54s)]
*  The the force happened at the end, but you're saying the lead-up was there was like in it was it ingratiation? [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9338.300000000001s)]
*  Is that the China China has? [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9346.1s)]
*  some of the best legal [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9349.26s)]
*  Capabilities in the world. That's why so many American law school graduates are actually Chinese citizens [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9351.86s)]
*  Because people come to law school here [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9356.86s)]
*  Chinese people come here for law school and they go practice law all over the world [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9359.300000000001s)]
*  I'm just a little American international law or American American law [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9363.02s)]
*  Democratic law and then they apply that so in Hong Kong what happened is over the course of maybe five years China [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9366.7s)]
*  systematically changed the [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9373.5s)]
*  Values of Hong Kong man using very legal methods [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9376.14s)]
*  It's really smart until the time came when they pulled the dial and they were like, hey Hong Kong now [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9379.42s)]
*  All of your citizens are held to Chinese standards Chinese laws and then the people were like that's not legal [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9385.02s)]
*  And then China was like actually yes, it is [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9391.06s)]
*  So this is really beating us at our own game [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9394.54s)]
*  It's just really smart. It's like how you avoid hot war [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9398.38s)]
*  It's wow, they don't have the military to win a hot war so well, I think they could win a hot war against Hong Kong [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9401.92s)]
*  Yeah, but maybe a little yeah superpowers kill right? [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9407.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so the same thing is happening in Taiwan and we may be paying attention to it now [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9411.400000000001s)]
*  it's been happening for the better part of a decade and if you just look at if you just look at [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9415.68s)]
*  Chinese influence on Taiwanese elections [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9421.2s)]
*  If you just google that and then put the word October in there [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9423.880000000001s)]
*  You'll see that the world woke up to it in October of 2023 [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9426.640000000001s)]
*  For an election that happened in January of 2024. That's hilarious [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9431.36s)]
*  That that doesn't mean that the Chinese the Chinese were building that pipeline for decades [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9435.04s)]
*  Yeah, and it worked and then now that the Congress of Taiwan is controlled by a pro-China team [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9439.720000000001s)]
*  It really doesn't matter what the head the figurehead says [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9445.68s)]
*  Chinese are exercising more in the international waters [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9449.320000000002s)]
*  The Chinese are have they've in the most recent National Congress that just happened like four days ago [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9451.880000000001s)]
*  They stopped talking about a peaceful reunification [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9457.52s)]
*  Peaceful reunification with Taiwan what they said they said [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9460.4s)]
*  We must take a forceful or rigid. Yeah, use a very different word [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9464.0s)]
*  It was like it was something along those lines [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9469.26s)]
*  Approach to our reunification with Taiwan [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9472.6s)]
*  I mean what an amazing [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9474.48s)]
*  Advantage that they would have on us if we don't have time to build up a semiconductor business and they absorb Taiwan peacefully [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9475.84s)]
*  What if they don't even have to be rich or fast? [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9482.04s)]
*  Their goal man, their goal is they don't want to invade they they want a piece they want to I mean [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9484.080000000002s)]
*  We're using the word peaceful in American terms. Yes. Yeah as little bloodshed as possible Cold War type shit [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9489.320000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean the if you manipulate the people into thinking it's what they want [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9494.720000000001s)]
*  That's the next level to the game is you trick the people into asking for it and then you oblige them [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9498.560000000001s)]
*  China goes. All right, if you really want it if the Congress really wants it and you guys all want it fine [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9505.84s)]
*  And your cup of coffee you what does that mean? What does that mean? [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9512.6s)]
*  Wow someone's paying attention [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9519.84s)]
*  Wow, that's great. Yeah, so that is the game. That is the idea [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9523.12s)]
*  That's the game the game and and that is Sun Tzu's art of war if you just look at fuck [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9526.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's been published since yeah the 11th. It's not even you [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9532.88s)]
*  Yeah, this is thousands of years old or whatever [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9537.4s)]
*  This this um, this is a Gigi ping guy [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9539.96s)]
*  How first of all, there's no way the CIA lets you leave you're out of your fucking mind [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9544.72s)]
*  No, cuz you're really good at this. I appreciate you're really good at this. You're great at communicating. You're really patient [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9549.08s)]
*  I mean if we ask you funny, you like are you a part of the CIA? [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9555.48s)]
*  I I am NOT a part of CIA. Yeah [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9558.56s)]
*  The straight-up truth. I am a former overt. My cover has been rolled back [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9562.359999999999s)]
*  I am NOT a member of CIA. Do you have clearance still? [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9567.2s)]
*  Nope, my clearance expired after two years just like they're supposed to do right? I've had a private contractor re-up my clearance [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9570.2s)]
*  So I have a I have a security clearance now under a private contractor, but not a federal for security clearance [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9577.039999999999s)]
*  And I run a business that I'm planning on scaling into the tens of millions like that's what I'm doing right now [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9583.52s)]
*  I'm telling you without a doubt smart [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9589.64s)]
*  I mean if the CIA calls me tomorrow and says we need your help, you'll do it without a doubt [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9591.36s)]
*  Now if they asked me to help introduce them to anybody that I'm on a podcast with I'd say yes [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9597.24s)]
*  Yeah, but the CIA is the DMV [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9601.44s)]
*  They don't think that way. They don't work that way. They don't take risks [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9604.2s)]
*  Yeah, the risk of me actually working for them and then that becoming publicly known is too great for them [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9607.119999999999s)]
*  So that's on them man. I guess I can do I guess what I meant by when I said you still work for the CIA [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9612.24s)]
*  It's not that you get a check [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9617.68s)]
*  Yeah [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9618.8s)]
*  in the same way that like a Mark Zuckerberg or whatever like I think you reach a certain point as a business owner in America where [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9619.08s)]
*  Like your business becomes [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9625.84s)]
*  What is a gas or electric? What are those called? [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9627.44s)]
*  Utility yeah, yeah, where you're it's almost like a utility right and then once you're a utility [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9630.16s)]
*  If the government calls you for something, you know, you kind of do it, right? [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9634.52s)]
*  You help them and I wonder if people that are in your position because I imagined you're kind of unique [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9638.2s)]
*  I don't know if every CIA operative is like you [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9644.2s)]
*  Would you say that you have a set of skills that also allows you to succeed as in like let's call this entertainment [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9647.48s)]
*  So I info tame it whatever you want to come I've certainly developed this because you it takes a lot of punches [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9653.32s)]
*  Before you learn how to do this stance gotcha, right? [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9660.08s)]
*  And it just so happened that I was I had no other options [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9663.119999999999s)]
*  Except to take some punches for a while got it. And that's how I kind of found my voice in this space. Got it [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9665.64s)]
*  Okay, because I do want you to talk about your business because I think it's an [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9670.56s)]
*  Put it this way. Maybe you should maybe you should tell people what the business does [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9675.199999999999s)]
*  because I think it's [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9680.32s)]
*  After listening to you incredibly effective. Yeah, thanks, man, but I don't think CIA is letting you go [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9682.16s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think they're paying you but I think that you could be incredibly useful to them [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9687.8s)]
*  I I honestly hope so and that's the same thing every former CIA officer says is we hope that one day [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9692.6s)]
*  CIA will wake up and realize that we can do a great deal to bring the community [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9700.16s)]
*  Back in support of the national security infrastructure [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9704.92s)]
*  Because when there's nothing that bridges the community with a national support and national security infrastructure [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9708.18s)]
*  Conspiracy theory reigns and distrust reigns because we fear what we don't understand. Yeah, I'm not sharing any [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9712.98s)]
*  National security secrets here. I'm just telling people like hey, we're the DMV at CIA [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9719.1s)]
*  It's staffed with a lot of hard-working dedicated people who are young who are trying to make a career and abandoning that career [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9724.539999999999s)]
*  Because of an old guard an old way of doing we're running like the DMV and China's running like Apple [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9730.94s)]
*  There we go, like Apple sees they're always ahead of the game it seems and it's not necessarily because of innovation at China [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9735.54s)]
*  Like it was an Apple. It's just because it's either planning player get the fuck out of the way. That's how they work, right? [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9742.02s)]
*  Okay, so my company everyday spy our mission is spy education to break barriers [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9747.18s)]
*  So I teach people real-world spy education facts about CIA facts about spy systems [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9752.460000000001s)]
*  Spy frameworks spy ways of thinking spy's way spy's way of keeping yourself safe [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9759.14s)]
*  If it if it has any grounding in real-world espionage or real-world spy tactics [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9763.74s)]
*  My mission is to teach that to the everyday person so they can use it to keep their family safe their business safe and their body [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9769.42s)]
*  Safe. Mm-hmm. That's what we do. But specifically in business [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9774.98s)]
*  Incredibly effective. It's incredibly effective in not just small business, but also in corporate business [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9779.38s)]
*  That's where I saw it. I and that's kind of how I assume you were gonna scale it [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9784.38s)]
*  I mean on the mop and pop mom and pop shop [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9787.82s)]
*  It's awesome [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9790.18s)]
*  But like sitting down with these CEOs and learning how to effectively communicate with the people that you might be going up against [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9790.86s)]
*  How to pull them in as assets how to extract information for them? [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9797.14s)]
*  I mean, yeah, and that's what I love what you guys are getting at and there is value there [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9800.34s)]
*  But what I found where the value really demonstrates itself is because it's hard just like spaghetti on the wall, you know [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9804.699999999999s)]
*  Post-modernist art funding in Europe during the Cold War. It's hard to it's hard to measure that [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9811.46s)]
*  Companies have a hard time measuring the real value of [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9816.18s)]
*  Communication skills or negotiation skills. Yeah, so instead what we often find is that our clients call us in for very specific [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9819.82s)]
*  discrete challenges [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9826.74s)]
*  We had the see we had a CFO of one of our clients [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9828.58s)]
*  Get deep faked on LinkedIn and they didn't know who to turn to but there's this deep fake video on LinkedIn of a CFO [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9833.38s)]
*  And they're like what the fuck are we gonna do like because this this is all lies that's been created [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9840.66s)]
*  So they call our company in we use our network of contacts and we're saying hey guys [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9845.9s)]
*  We've got a we've got to follow the money to find out where this deep fake came from who's behind it [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9850.06s)]
*  Who's funding it? And how do we shut it down sick? I see. Okay, so you're also problem-solving [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9854.28s)]
*  That's like a crisis management [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9858.619999999999s)]
*  But that's where it all starts because really when it comes to adding value to people just like that cup of coffee [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9860.1s)]
*  You have to add immediate value. You can't add the promise of future value. You have to add immediate value [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9864.86s)]
*  So when people are in their most the position where they're most vulnerable [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9870.5s)]
*  Yeah, and they come to you and they say can you do this? [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9874.14s)]
*  It's very helpful to have a set of skills where you can do things nobody [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9876.26s)]
*  What point do you tell them you created the deep fake video? [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9879.3s)]
*  Giving away [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9883.98s)]
*  CIA training that's not going against like whistle-blowing or giving away CIA tricks [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9885.5s)]
*  So the thing that CIA protects is called their sources and their methods and what they mean by sources and methods are [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9891.14s)]
*  Sources of active current intelligence collection and methods by which those sources are being collected against you so when you teach a framework [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9898.86s)]
*  like [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9906.86s)]
*  Understanding human psychology of reciprocity. That's not a CIA. It's not specific to them [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9908.1s)]
*  They're taking it from some book that uh, yeah, oh the fuck is that guy boss? [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9913.02s)]
*  No, well boss is a CIA guy, but there's a book called influence by child Dini. I think it's a D. Yeah [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9916.660000000002s)]
*  Kial Dini how do you pronounce it? But yeah, so I imagine some of the tactics are coming from that right? [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9923.02s)]
*  So so some of these things exist in the ether and these experts have written about it for years and the CIA have probably distilled [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9927.74s)]
*  It down to the most effective like the sharpest tack because they need to teach people fast [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9933.86s)]
*  Yeah, and they need to teach people to use these skills in the real world under pressure. I mean to me [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9938.18s)]
*  I'm like I'm looking at you. Let's say I have a business, right? [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9942.74s)]
*  I mean we have a business here [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9946.1s)]
*  But let's say I have a business with a hundred employees and you need the management of those employees and the management with all those [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9947.22s)]
*  Assets if you will, how do you instill loyalty in them? How do you get people to? [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9952.26s)]
*  I guess commit to the ideology of this brand that you're all working for like it seems to me like it'd be incredibly effective to go [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9957.5s)]
*  to either military or to CIA training to [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9964.140000000001s)]
*  To get the best out of your employees and also make them feel like they're most committed to this [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9968.42s)]
*  This belief system or this business like that's a no-brainer [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9974.1s)]
*  Right the place where with the I as much as I joke about CIA being as efficient as the DMV [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9977.140000000001s)]
*  Which is not very efficient that is true. But what they have become very very adept at is creating a hyper loyal [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9983.74s)]
*  Structure that keeps secrets and really as a business [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9992.18s)]
*  That's what a business owner wants is a hyper loyal group that keeps secrets and we call that [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=9995.5s)]
*  Institutionalization and there's a model for institutionalization. It's a model that was developed by a psychologist [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10001.140000000001s)]
*  honed over decades of being applied at CIA that now because I left CIA and [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10006.300000000001s)]
*  Learned these tools at CIA [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10012.060000000001s)]
*  I can now take what I learned at CIA the distilled version of what this psychologist put in academic terms [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10013.86s)]
*  Yeah, and I can speak about it in layman's terms also like a catch it hiring just imagine the value in HR [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10020.34s)]
*  Yeah, I could see you guys having a lot of value outside of just like singular tasks and singer problems that need to be solved [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10025.9s)]
*  But really about building the infrastructure for the business hiring specifically like if you know that you need somebody [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10033.1s)]
*  like let's say you're hiring a manager or like an agent and that agent is gonna have to operate in some murky territory where [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10040.54s)]
*  That guilt complex is gonna be an issue not speaking about dove at all [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10047.5s)]
*  But like like for example for me like I couldn't do what some of these agents do sometimes these agents try to poach me for [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10051.62s)]
*  my agents, right and like [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10057.34s)]
*  It just feels kind of icky, but they don't have that feeling of ickiness [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10059.460000000001s)]
*  How can you screen for that? Yeah, you could probably develop something very easily [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10063.86s)]
*  That would help you screen for that right and then that would distill the hiring process and make it so much more efficient [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10068.78s)]
*  Automate the whole thing you I mean we we boil it all down to personalities [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10073.64s)]
*  You could have them take a test you don't even have to meet them until they pass all the requirements [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10077.06s)]
*  You're saving weeks of time you you can have them take a [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10080.86s)]
*  Short battery that gives you their personality [[02:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10084.62s)]
*  You can have an assessment for what type of personality you need for the position and then you can also automate a step where they [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10086.54s)]
*  Have to demonstrate that they're good for the position by carrying out a specific task [[02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10091.78s)]
*  That's even a profit generating task or revenue generating tasks [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10095.34s)]
*  And then and that's before they're even hired right yeah [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10099.980000000001s)]
*  And then you can even pay them for accomplishing the task of course and you can pay them a portion of the profit that they [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10102.94s)]
*  Just earned right so now you're indoctrinating them right at the very beginning that if you're gonna work for us you must generate revenue [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10107.580000000002s)]
*  And you will be rewarded based on a profit share of the revenue that you earned have you thought about trying to restructure the CIA [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10113.02s)]
*  Like how would look for you one of my I? [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10117.9s)]
*  Have a I have five year goals and ten year goals and one of my ten year goals for our company is to have a formal [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10121.220000000001s)]
*  Contract with at least five members of the intelligence community where we are bringing best practices of corporate [[02:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10127.82s)]
*  America into the internet. Maybe we should make that a seven year goal [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10134.82s)]
*  I [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10138.7s)]
*  Just found it out. It'd be nice [[02:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10142.060000000001s)]
*  But so essentially and what would what problem would that essentially solve so the big problem the the [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10144.1s)]
*  Lifetime problem the personal mission problem that I have is I want to keep America as the dominant democracy in the world [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10151.02s)]
*  We need to remain as the world's superpower [[02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10156.16s)]
*  Yeah, if my kids are gonna have kids with American passports and American citizenship [[02:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10158.16s)]
*  I need to do everything in my power to make sure that the United States remains dominant [[02:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10162.68s)]
*  Which means I need to make sure my business makes as much money as possible to feed GDP and I need to make sure [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10166.460000000001s)]
*  Every client I service makes as much money as possible to feed GDP so we can keep this machine going [[02:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10172.12s)]
*  especially if we're going through middle school and [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10176.98s)]
*  Presidents are gonna be fuck-offs and Congress people are gonna be dickwads [[02:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10179.86s)]
*  Yeah, we have to keep funding this train until the voting public can mature past that. Yeah [[02:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10182.9s)]
*  Hmm, so that's my goal money money is not what I want [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10189.98s)]
*  Money is the tool that gets me what I what you need but with the CIA and reforming it have you [[02:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10194.66s)]
*  Had do you have an idea of how the CIA could look? I think it could look like a very beautiful thing [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10200.22s)]
*  But that's intelligence reform and that's the legislative branch and the executive branch working in concert [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10208.14s)]
*  And that's them opening up to outside [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10215.1s)]
*  civilian [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10219.5s)]
*  Consultants that it's a huge culture change for them if they're gonna go down there how but you do have an idea of it [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10221.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah, exactly just from sitting with you for a couple hours. I think you you have it exactly [[02:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10227.74s)]
*  I appreciate I mean, thank you for the vote of high confidence [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10233.54s)]
*  I would give myself about 60% vision because you've got to leave space in there for the realities of how things and how people work [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10235.98s)]
*  How likely is it any of this happens in your brain? [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10242.06s)]
*  in for things that things you think need to happen I [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10245.38s)]
*  Mean I think that in my lifetime before I die in my hopeful late 80s, I [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10249.060000000001s)]
*  Mean, there's there's a 20% chance that we see significant intelligence reform without a disaster [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10256.02s)]
*  Because we remember not a disaster 9-eleven was what brought intelligence reform the first time so you're saying we need another one [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10263.18s)]
*  Unfortunately, we are a country that has a very short memory [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10270.140000000001s)]
*  We're reactive and until an enemy presents itself loud and clear we don't unify and China knows that which is why they don't present themselves [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10273.5s)]
*  It's a clear and present danger [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10280.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah, cuz they don't want our unity they'll wait to the last possible moment [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10283.46s)]
*  They've read the playboy war. Okay, that's our model. Yeah, don't win. Don't engage in war until you know, you can win Wow [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10288.539999999999s)]
*  So be besties continue making all our shit [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10295.419999999998s)]
*  Yeah, wow because we already know that when you invade Taiwan [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10299.02s)]
*  It's only gonna take about 12 weeks for everybody to forget anyways [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10302.460000000001s)]
*  That is true. We have a short memory [[02:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10306.02s)]
*  Wow, so they know they could invade Taiwan [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10309.26s)]
*  We probably wouldn't do anything. Let's like are we really gonna let American soldiers die for Taiwan? [[02:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10312.54s)]
*  It'd be really hard to get American support for that [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10318.300000000001s)]
*  Was we public first response on that for like are the ships that are in that area supposed to make a first day? [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10320.900000000001s)]
*  Response if there was an invasion [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10327.54s)]
*  So and that's the big question right there is what is the the military doctrine for engaging China? [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10329.54s)]
*  Day one day one because that's that's the thing if you if you have a destroyer off the coast of southern China [[02:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10336.26s)]
*  That launches cruise missiles onto mainland China [[02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10342.62s)]
*  We're war baby and that destroyer is going to be sunk because it's right at the gates of China [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10345.66s)]
*  Yeah, so what does that destroyer do? Does it just park itself in the Taiwan Strait? [[02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10351.7s)]
*  Or you park yourself in the Taiwan port and now any attack on Taiwan is an attack on American soldiers [[02:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10355.82s)]
*  as long as if [[02:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10361.98s)]
*  You can prevent from attacking that port [[02:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10363.98s)]
*  So they'll attack every port but so now you need a ship at every fucking port. Oh, yeah [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10366.78s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, possible because China knows that you don't piss off Americans unless you kill Americans [[02:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10370.94s)]
*  And if you do we just go crazy. Yep, so they will find every way possible to engage Taiwan without [[02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10376.38s)]
*  Killing an American soldier [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10382.54s)]
*  That's the way that's the way to keep America fat and lazy is just don't [[02:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10385.18s)]
*  Don't hurt our people and we have a shocking level of forgiveness after that [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10390.300000000001s)]
*  Hmm so fucking true. Oh [[02:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10396.18s)]
*  My god, okay any any other questions before we get I had all these but I didn't [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10398.740000000002s)]
*  Writing on the back of this fucking paper. I'm not sure what you can share, but I'm curious [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10403.900000000001s)]
*  Can you tell us any stories about extreme like near-death experiences on any operations that you were on or anything that [[02:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10407.66s)]
*  Maybe you were almost exposed because obviously this is high risk. Yeah. Yeah, so so [[02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10414.42s)]
*  With the one operation that I'm very proud of. Yeah, the that operation ended with my near capture [[02:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10419.46s)]
*  Oh fuck and I'm trying to get all of those details cleared so I can publish them all so that's that's my personal example [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10426.18s)]
*  So that's that's my personal example wife involved as well. No, my wife was geographically separate [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10433.18s)]
*  Oh, she was fine exactly, but but that's the story. I'm trying to get clearance to tell and hopefully that'll clearance will come soon [[02:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10439.380000000001s)]
*  But that's just me and the thing is [[02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10448.18s)]
*  My story was just about capture [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10450.42s)]
*  There are other CIA officers who were already captured who were already imprisoned who were already interrogated who were used for political propaganda [[02:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10452.7s)]
*  I mean the stories the the heroes of CIA I [[02:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10460.539999999999s)]
*  Swear to you the heroes of CIA are still at CIA [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10465.42s)]
*  Because they have chosen [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10469.22s)]
*  To sacrifice everything else to stay there. I mean, I feel like I am proud to have been from there, but I chose to leave [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10471.42s)]
*  right, it's a if [[02:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10480.179999999998s)]
*  They are a different kind of hero for choosing to stay give it up for those guys, bro. Yeah facts [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10482.34s)]
*  Question of a question. Yes, go mom [[02:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10488.34s)]
*  What like sort of movie or book or piece of content do you think sort of like best represents? [[02:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10491.58s)]
*  either your experience of the CIA or the CIA and it could be fiction or non-fiction but like [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10497.86s)]
*  So yeah, it is a very good question. So in the [[02:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10503.14s)]
*  in the book world, there's a very dry read called inside the CIA and [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10507.7s)]
*  It's one of those dry reads that is mandatory for every new candidate [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10513.74s)]
*  So if you want to know what it's actually like inside the CIA read the book inside the CIA was published in like the 90s [[02:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10518.22s)]
*  I want to say so it was pre 9-eleven CIA, but it's still fairly accurate for how it's been reformatted since then, right? [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10523.42s)]
*  So that's book wise film wise [[02:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10530.74s)]
*  I would actually recommend the first season of the Americans if you watch season one of the Americans [[02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10532.74s)]
*  You will see some of the most authentic trade crafts [[02:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10537.539999999999s)]
*  Covert communications some of the real-world stressors that they have trying to trying to remain [[02:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10541.619999999999s)]
*  Clandestinely engaged in operations while also operating in a cover life you and your wife watch that together [[02:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10548.82s)]
*  Are you like now this is too close to home. It's too close to home [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10554.02s)]
*  It's like being a surgeon and watching that like Grey's Anatomy or something, right? [[02:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10556.74s)]
*  So like you watch it and you're like this is not entertaining because we were there or it's too fabricated to be real [[02:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10560.46s)]
*  And that also loses our entertainment value. So my wife is a much bigger consumer of spy fiction than I am [[02:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10567.5s)]
*  But periodically I'll watch something where I'm like, oh that was that was pretty solid, right? [[02:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10574.22s)]
*  Gray man why just season one for me and so good. Gray man's also pretty good [[02:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10578.42s)]
*  I actually knew the creative consultant from CIA for gray man [[02:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10582.58s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons it was so good and the person who is the most accurate in all of gray man [[02:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10586.18s)]
*  Still comically created is the private Intel contractor [[02:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10590.82s)]
*  That character in gray man is is the most accurate of all the characters in gray man [[02:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10594.9s)]
*  But you're to answer your question. Yeah, you said just season one of the Americans wide after that. It became commercialized [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10600.339999999998s)]
*  After that they got more money and more popularity. So they had to ramp up the excitement and adventure [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10607.099999999999s)]
*  Season one is still very like clandestine and sophisticated. Yeah and grounded [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10612.619999999999s)]
*  You said in an interview that you were talking about general Petraeus and [[02:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10617.74s)]
*  You said that you're very complimentary of him [[02:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10624.380000000001s)]
*  And you're talking about your guys relationship and the things that he shared with you and it's really beautiful [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10627.140000000001s)]
*  But you said want this sentence that called my attention you go [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10631.82s)]
*  You don't get to be that powerful without making mistakes and then you kind of just moved on. Mm-hmm [[02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10635.62s)]
*  What does that mean? [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10641.86s)]
*  What does that mean [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10644.38s)]
*  So I don't want to characterize my relationship with general Petraeus as being like a close personal relationship [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10646.22s)]
*  I I was a I was one of the few CIA officers that could keep up with his fitness regimen when he was a CI when [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10651.62s)]
*  He was the director at CIA [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10658.1s)]
*  So when he needed a workout buddy, and I was within a helicopter ride, I worked out with him, right? [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10659.06s)]
*  So he didn't have to work out alone [[02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10664.56s)]
*  When we would work out just like when you guys work out you talk about shit and [[02:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10666.86s)]
*  The thing that I was always the most interested in talking him about was family [[02:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10670.94s)]
*  Because I mean everybody knew he was a great general and you know, he was a hardcore [[02:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10675.18s)]
*  Director at CIA, but he had I think he had two daughters three children overall [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10680.26s)]
*  And then of course everything happened after his mistress was outed [[02:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10686.42s)]
*  So I used to always ask him like as these are the years in my time at CIA leading up to my child's birth [[02:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10690.1s)]
*  and I'm like, how did you choose to like [[02:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10696.300000000001s)]
*  Lead the Afghan [[02:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10699.98s)]
*  Forces versus be home with your newborn daughter [[02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10702.74s)]
*  And he was always very honest about the fact that that when he looks back he regrets [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10705.779999999999s)]
*  The sacrifices that he made for his children [[02:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10712.34s)]
*  Because of a fight in Afghanistan that ultimately policymakers abandoned [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10715.74s)]
*  So now he's lost two legacies [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10720.5s)]
*  Yeah, because he doesn't have the relationship with his children and he doesn't have the legacy of Afghanistan [[02:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10722.74s)]
*  Right, but that's what a soldier does and that's how you you know serve and whatever else [[02:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10726.98s)]
*  But I took that like it hit me heavy man [[02:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10732.5s)]
*  Yeah, cuz I'm like, you know what when you work for the federal government at the behest of the executive [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10735.699999999999s)]
*  The executive changes every four years if you're if if you're lucky, it doesn't happen earlier than that [[02:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10740.06s)]
*  So are you willing to dedicate a life and potentially lose everything you worked for because of a change in American leadership? [[02:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10745.46s)]
*  So it was so that's what I meant by that quote like to become as powerful as he did [[02:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10752.38s)]
*  He had to he had to say yes to every operation presented to him [[02:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10757.1s)]
*  No matter how impossible the odds were or no matter how much sacrifice was required on his family [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10761.5s)]
*  Oh, I interpret that completely differently [[02:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10766.46s)]
*  I interpreted as they knew he was having an affair and that's why he was put in a position of power because he could be controlled [[02:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10769.699999999999s)]
*  No, it was it was [[02:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10775.66s)]
*  At the end of his career as a 60 year old man looking back [[02:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10777.82s)]
*  He made these massive mistakes. He prioritized career over everything and that will be a mistake as you reflect [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10781.94s)]
*  He already is as he reflects it is a mistake. Yeah, you know what you can't do [[02:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10787.5s)]
*  That's you can't win back your 18 year old child that you didn't love when they were 10. Yeah, you can't win them back [[02:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10791.32s)]
*  How often is it that you see this in the movies? [[02:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10796.5s)]
*  There's like some young hacker kid or some linguist or something [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10800.78s)]
*  The CIA reaches out to them and gets it. Is this [[03:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10805.18s)]
*  Fiction or is this actually happen it so it's a mix it does actually happen [[03:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10809.98s)]
*  Super talented people are plucked up by the agency all the time [[03:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10814.5s)]
*  there are also super talented criminals that are arrested by FBI and [[03:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10817.74s)]
*  plucked up by CIA right because that's one of the ways CIA can always stay on the cutting edge of [[03:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10822.22s)]
*  Prisoners run the asylum of nefarious activity [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10827.82s)]
*  Yeah, right has learned from the best and did you feel like they did that with you that they recruited you were they aware? [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10830.259999999998s)]
*  Of you I think that for me I [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10835.38s)]
*  Fell into an automated [[03:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10838.58s)]
*  Process right you're in the Air Force. I'm in the Air Force high clearance high clearance [[03:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10840.94s)]
*  I have been in the Air Force since I was 18 years old [[03:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10844.82s)]
*  All I've ever known is military structure and I came from a military household before that they knew my grades [[03:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10847.62s)]
*  They knew my health status. They knew how many push-ups I did for the for the physical fitness exam [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10853.18s)]
*  They knew everything about me my languages. So when I applied for the Peace Corps a [[03:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10857.54s)]
*  federal government organization, I [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10862.78s)]
*  Just fell I triggered some algorithm somewhere where they were like, oh this person is someone we should talk to else [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10865.18s)]
*  Because if you think about it, what does somebody at the Peace Corps want to venture travel high-risk tolerance? [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10871.86s)]
*  They have no problem with discomfort. They want to change the world [[03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10878.1s)]
*  Well, what does the CIA officer want all the same shit, right? And you must have checked the other boxes as well [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10881.58s)]
*  They already had character screening on you [[03:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10886.74s)]
*  That's fitness. Now. Here's here's a question [[03:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10889.140000000001s)]
*  Did you have they have all this information on you [[03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10892.84s)]
*  The interview process is it even necessary [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10897.64s)]
*  It is it is because but you get what I'm doing right? Like you got to keep in mind that information is always past tense [[03:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10901.92s)]
*  So you could have changed so it's making sure that you're meeting up with the information that they have about you, right? [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10909.12s)]
*  So they're not going you're gonna wow us. They're going we're wowed [[03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10915.24s)]
*  Let's see if you live up to it also [[03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10919.72s)]
*  See all those questions that you have to answer. I assume is different than what we've seen. Yeah, this is like [[03:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10922.48s)]
*  I'm gonna ask you about your past. How are you gonna answer this? What are you gonna tell me? Yeah [[03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10927.32s)]
*  It's like a much more intimate thing that is what I can learn [[03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10930.78s)]
*  You got a polygraph that you have to go through [[03:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10932.92s)]
*  Yeah, right like they they have a lot of control as they ramp up the experience or the [[03:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10934.96s)]
*  Onboarding experience would you have weapons training? Did you get weapons? [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10939.64s)]
*  I had weapons training from the military, of course, and then you get more when you're at CIA [[03:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10943.24s)]
*  There's different types you ever kill somebody I cannot answer that question in great detail [[03:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10946.36s)]
*  I can't say that I've never intimately killed anybody intimately killed anybody. What does that mean? [[03:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10951.6s)]
*  That means when you kill somebody in shoot them personal range [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10955.800000000001s)]
*  But maybe intelligence that you've given ended up getting somebody or you've used some other kind of kinetic strike [[03:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10958.92s)]
*  That's not person to person. I got your own strike would fall into that category of not intimate [[03:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10964.16s)]
*  Are there things that you I know that you don't necessarily [[03:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10969.480000000001s)]
*  Feel the guilt [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10972.6s)]
*  You feel it, but it doesn't inhibit your actions. Are there things that you regret? [[03:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10974.6s)]
*  Is there PTSD that you feel from really you know [[03:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10982.56s)]
*  You hear all this stuff about people who have been in these environments that you've been in and it's pretty awful [[03:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10987.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so I I am confident. I do not have PTSD. Okay, because I've worked with plenty of people who have PTSD [[03:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=10992.56s)]
*  I've been through some traumatic events, but a big part of the reason I started a business it I [[03:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11000.160000000002s)]
*  to learn about business [[03:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11006.0s)]
*  I started by writing a blog and all my blog was was [[03:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11008.0s)]
*  My feelings my stories my thoughts and how I'm trying to make something productive out of all these destructive skills [[03:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11013.6s)]
*  So it was in that process of kind of like a self therapy the blog turned into a podcast [[03:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11019.6s)]
*  The podcast turned into a product offering the product offering turned into kind of [[03:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11025.64s)]
*  Mastering the content right and that was all 2018 when it started, right? [[03:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11030.64s)]
*  So fast forward to now in 2024 and it's much more evolved and it's much more developed and I have a much [[03:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11035.56s)]
*  Cleaner understanding of my own thought process, but that was essentially six years of therapy [[03:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11040.84s)]
*  That I was able to put myself through and do exactly what I wanted to do create something productive [[03:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11046.359999999999s)]
*  Out of the destructive path that I had before that [[03:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11052.119999999999s)]
*  Did you use any of the skills you learned on raising your own children all the time all the time and my children know it [[03:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11056.279999999999s)]
*  and they [[03:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11062.519999999999s)]
*  They don't know any alternative to it. So like our family uses code words [[03:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11064.039999999999s)]
*  So, I don't know what you don't your kids are too young. Do you have kids yet? You're married [[03:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11068.599999999999s)]
*  No, so one of the biggest challenges that parents have is teaching their kids when to open like a hotel room door when the parents [[03:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11072.439999999999s)]
*  Go downstairs to go get ice or something or when it's when it's safe to open the door to a stranger [[03:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11079.24s)]
*  Especially because strangers can say their police officers or say their amazon delivery people. Yeah, so our kids we teach them code words [[03:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11083.72s)]
*  So if a stranger comes to the door and that stranger is sent by us, they will know a specific code word [[03:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11090.199999999999s)]
*  So our children know to ask a question at the door. They don't ask. What's the code word? [[03:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11095.56s)]
*  They ask a very specific question. Oh, wow [[03:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11099.72s)]
*  They wait until they hear the response back and if they don't get the code word back [[03:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11102.199999999999s)]
*  And they wait until they hear the response back and if they don't get the code word back [[03:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11105.48s)]
*  They don't set the door. Did you give them field tests? Yeah, I figured [[03:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11109.0s)]
*  You need that now for ai everyone's gonna need code words because you can just ai anyone's voice. Yeah, that's true [[03:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11113.08s)]
*  Asking do you have any other cia parenting tips? Yes. So another one is uh, [[03:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11118.52s)]
*  everybody wants control so one of the things that you learn about psychology is that we're all vying for control and [[03:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11123.56s)]
*  Uh [[03:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11129.24s)]
*  Feeling control isn't the same thing as actually having control to your point about that gut feeling, right? [[03:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11130.36s)]
*  So oftentimes what we need to feel like we have control is we just need to feel like we have a say [[03:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11135.64s)]
*  in the outcome [[03:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11142.04s)]
*  Hmm, so with my children first, uh, they started brushing their teeth, right? [[03:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11143.48s)]
*  So I would always and they never want to brush their teeth every parent knows children never want to brush their teeth [[03:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11147.8s)]
*  So we would say do you want to brush your teeth now or in two minutes? [[03:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11152.04s)]
*  And just having that say in the outcome completely changes their willingness to do it [[03:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11156.279999999999s)]
*  so we do have this like innate autonomy we want to be the [[03:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11161.32s)]
*  The conductors is that human or American? Yeah, it's human human beings want to believe that we have power over our future [[03:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11165.88s)]
*  Yeah, what we don't do a very good job of is defining what future we're talking about [[03:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11173.56s)]
*  So with my kids now or in two minutes, they're like [[03:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11178.119999999999s)]
*  Oh, I have two more minutes if I say two minutes and then I can go brush my teeth or if you're my daughter [[03:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11181.08s)]
*  I can say two minutes and then in two minutes negotiate again. Yeah [[03:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11186.92s)]
*  But either way like they feel like they have some sort of power and oftentimes that's what an employee wants [[03:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11190.44s)]
*  How many employees I mean i'll never forget. Uh, I went on a hiring surge this year [[03:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11195.08s)]
*  I had somebody who uh who I made an offer to [[03:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11199.720000000001s)]
*  And I think it was 80 000. I made an offer them to come on as a junior level person in my company [[03:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11203.08s)]
*  And [[03:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11208.119999999999s)]
*  They hemmed and hawed about it for a couple of days and they asked to meet with me and my president [[03:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11208.92s)]
*  so they could come up with a counter offer and they came back and after a lot of like [[03:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11212.2s)]
*  I've got kids and i've got this and i've got ambitions and i've got whatever they came back with a counter offer of 85 000 [[03:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11216.6s)]
*  and I was like [[03:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11222.36s)]
*  Like your counter offer is 5 000. Yeah, like that's not a counter offer. Yeah, that's sure [[03:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11224.039999999999s)]
*  That's an easy yes for me. If you think like 5 000 spread over 12 months of work over [[03:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11229.0s)]
*  2080 hours of your talent [[03:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11234.34s)]
*  Like that's easy, but to that person [[03:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11236.66s)]
*  They felt like they were taking control over their futures. Yeah, it's like, you know, I appreciate your counter offer [[03:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11239.7s)]
*  I think it's very reasonable. Let's do it [[03:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11244.98s)]
*  What was your initial offer lower knowing that they would counter offer always that's that's a basic negotiation [[03:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11247.3s)]
*  Is that person still at your company because he's probably watching this right now like fuck [[03:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11251.94s)]
*  Should have came in [[03:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11256.58s)]
*  One of the wisest things I heard my friend got a job offer and then he go I go he goes I rejected [[03:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11258.18s)]
*  I go what was he goes? I don't know. I just reject the first offer. He didn't even look at it [[03:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11263.3s)]
*  He just rejected it because he knows they're gonna lowball [[03:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11266.66s)]
*  There's a there's a [[03:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11269.939999999999s)]
*  negotiation tactic called always starting with no [[03:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11271.3s)]
*  Right, it's something you'll hear some advanced negotiators talk about start with no because once [[03:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11274.42s)]
*  Once a salesperson or that other person making the offer hears no [[03:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11278.42s)]
*  Then they at least know where the starting place is right start with no, I think is a book actually [[03:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11282.34s)]
*  But no is the place that you want to go for first? [[03:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11288.179999999998s)]
*  Is somebody listening to this podcast and that's their job at the cia [[03:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11290.58s)]
*  Not because you're on it. Mm, but like when we do it regularly like do we have a guy? [[03:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11296.42s)]
*  No, you probably don't have a guy. Here's what most likely happens [[03:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11301.380000000001s)]
*  What most likely happens is there's a algorithm. Yeah, there's an ai [[03:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11305.14s)]
*  and [[03:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11309.86s)]
*  Any youtuber with probably over a million followers? [[03:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11310.9s)]
*  Falls into that algorithms watch list [[03:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11314.42s)]
*  And that algorithm is looking for keywords like what? [[03:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11317.779999999999s)]
*  Terrorism. Yeah terrorism a lock bar terrorist attack. Yeah, you know what? [[03:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11321.22s)]
*  I mean, let's just list them out so that you make sure that you get flagged this time [[03:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11325.539999999999s)]
*  That'd be good because then maybe if we say enough a guy has to listen to it [[03:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11328.82s)]
*  You know, there's like a mandatory like person there we go. And then we get him like a great day [[03:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11333.699999999999s)]
*  Like what an awesome day. So i'm a chinese sympathizer. Yes [[03:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11338.34s)]
*  Chinese sympathizer. Oh, they've heard that a couple [[03:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11342.42s)]
*  Yeah, they're listening [[03:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11344.98s)]
*  We'll hit all those words right now [[03:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11349.06s)]
*  I mean just the idea to me sounds so funny that there's a dude who like he has to listen to podcasts [[03:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11350.34s)]
*  Like surely rogan has one right there's somebody has to listen to every rogan [[03:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11355.46s)]
*  Well, the the reason that it's so valuable is because the guests that you guys have on the podcast are [[03:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11358.66s)]
*  Insight into your network because they're connected to you, right? [[03:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11365.36s)]
*  There are insights into the network that they carry with them because once they've been with you [[03:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11369.7s)]
*  You can basically follow the trail to see what their network is next [[03:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11373.22s)]
*  And then you can see whether or not what they're talking about could be twisted into propaganda for a foreign country [[03:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11376.26s)]
*  You said after 9 11 all the government agencies share information now aliens ufos real or not [[03:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11384.34s)]
*  so [[03:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11392.9s)]
*  There's a fantastic article that was written. I think by the wall street journal [[03:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11394.42s)]
*  The head of aro, which is the dod's [[03:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11399.539999999999s)]
*  UFO research wing was a true scientist and engineer just came out to basically say there is no truth [[03:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11402.82s)]
*  No grounds. No nothing that ufos are real my stance on this is that ufos are real [[03:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11410.58s)]
*  But they're not [[03:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11417.7s)]
*  aliens [[03:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11419.14s)]
*  98 of what happens in the sky. Yeah, we'll be able to rationalize and describe without a problem [[03:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11421.46s)]
*  The two percent of what happens in the sky that we don't know should scare us a whole hell of a lot more than it does [[03:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11427.619999999999s)]
*  Because if it's not aliens [[03:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11433.06s)]
*  It's it's us [[03:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11435.619999999999s)]
*  And it's some shit about us that we don't even know [[03:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11437.699999999999s)]
*  And that's scary. And why is that scary? Because that could be [[03:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11440.9s)]
*  A next fleet of drones developed by the russians. That could be a hypersonic cruise missile by china [[03:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11444.9s)]
*  Yeah, that could be some weird sort of joint new thing [[03:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11449.939999999999s)]
*  That's being developed by syria and iran and north korea and like it's being tested over montana [[03:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11453.38s)]
*  Like that is some scary shit when you take aliens out of it [[03:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11458.42s)]
*  We want to find comfort in aliens because maybe they're here for good reasons. Once you say it's a fucking bad guy [[03:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11461.06s)]
*  There's no good reasons for it to be there. Yeah, something with uh ufos and earthquakes [[03:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11466.58s)]
*  Like what was that? [[03:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11471.779999999999s)]
*  So there's how they're correlated. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, there's something called earth lights [[03:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11473.3s)]
*  Which happen when certain gases are released from an earthquake and then they light they they they have translucent [[03:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11476.98s)]
*  Appearances in the sky. So a lot of times people will see lights in the sky. They can't define [[03:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11483.3s)]
*  Ball lightning is one of those very rare phenomenon. Another is these earth lights. So when there's an earthquake [[03:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11488.9s)]
*  That releases gas it can create these earth lights [[03:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11493.939999999999s)]
*  And that's why a lot of times you see in the west people spot ufos the most out west [[03:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11496.58s)]
*  Where there's the most fault lines and there's the most earthquake activity [[03:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11500.42s)]
*  So believe there's aliens and aliens. Yeah, I mean, I mean there's some weird ass people out there anyways, so [[03:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11504.26s)]
*  So china [[03:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11509.7s)]
*  Don't talk about daddy like that [[03:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11512.900000000001s)]
*  Anything else ranger before he gets out of here? [[03:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11516.42s)]
*  Um, oh, here's a question. I have some self-interest in india [[03:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11518.980000000001s)]
*  Is that a threat to china is that an emerging superpower because we get told that a lot [[03:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11522.58s)]
*  So I was actually wondering about this how how close are you with your indian? [[03:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11527.060000000001s)]
*  Ethnicity your indian family your culture. I don't know enough. I have a ton of family in india. I try to go back every year [[03:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11532.240000000002s)]
*  I love india [[03:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11537.779999999999s)]
*  I have been talking to my wife about maybe splitting time there when we have kids half the year in india half the year somewhere else [[03:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11538.5s)]
*  So shameless plug I want to go to india with you next time you go done or one of the times you go [[03:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11544.42s)]
*  Let's go. I yes because i'm getting secrets from you for this though. I need you to know that's a good train [[03:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11548.58s)]
*  That's a good train. Yeah, here's the truth about india [[03:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11554.099999999999s)]
*  India has two of the best intelligence services in the world [[03:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11556.58s)]
*  One of them is the research analysis wing which is their foreign collection wing. The other is their internal ring wing [[03:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11560.58s)]
*  The problem is that nobody knows about india's intelligence capabilities because 80 of their effort goes into pakistan [[03:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11565.779999999999s)]
*  Pakistan also has a super powerful foreign intelligence collection wing called isi [[03:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11574.019999999999s)]
*  So raw in india and isi in pakistan are spending almost all of their resources and time each other on each other [[03:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11578.42s)]
*  India is I was just talking about it earlier today. I think they are so powerfully pragmatic [[03:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11586.099999999999s)]
*  That they have found a way to be america's ally and china's ally and russia's ally [[03:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11592.9s)]
*  While they're increasing their gdp increasing their consumption and increasing their population [[03:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11599.62s)]
*  All three things that make for a very stellar future [[03:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11604.74s)]
*  Right. So india is doing right now india is doing everything right? [[03:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11608.18s)]
*  Nobody really talks about them except the when the us press talks about them. They talk about them in a negative way [[03:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11612.58s)]
*  Like we can't rely on india. They can't they don't back us anymore and it's like no india's backing india [[03:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11618.98s)]
*  Which is exactly how a country is supposed to operate right and as they become the manufacturing hub of the world [[03:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11625.22s)]
*  Then that's going to make everybody that much more dependent on on them [[03:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11633.14s)]
*  But they they will also run into a challenge when they choose to modernize [[03:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11635.78s)]
*  But they can put off that question for 20 or 30 years easy [[03:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11639.3s)]
*  I mean america would be incentivized to really cozy up to india [[03:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11642.9s)]
*  Given proximity to china if nothing else, right? [[03:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11647.22s)]
*  I mean, I think all of them would be like if china eventually isn't going to be manufacturing everything in the world [[03:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11649.22s)]
*  And that passes over to india india wants to be best friends with china [[03:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11654.02s)]
*  If they're best friends with russia and then the united states and perfect. Yeah, let it rip [[03:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11657.3s)]
*  Yeah, and not only that but then that makes it so that russia [[03:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11661.7s)]
*  Russia china in the united states russia is not really a player economically like the chinese united states are but now china and the united states [[03:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11664.98s)]
*  Both are incentivized to push production to india [[03:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11670.5s)]
*  And try to lobby for tariffs against the other country [[03:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11674.5s)]
*  So india is in a position to have basically people say we want you to have this business and we'll pay you even more [[03:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11678.18s)]
*  If you'll increase your tariffs on them on them, which they're going to say yes to both both [[03:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11684.5s)]
*  But they'll change the tariffs each other. So steal tariff against the united states plastic tariff against china. Wow based on who pays more for what? [[03:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11689.220000000001s)]
*  I've okay one more now that we have you [[03:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11698.18s)]
*  You this is a military industrial question that we were talking about a little bit before [[03:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11701.46s)]
*  But if we need the military industrial complex if we need war to get out of recessions economically [[03:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11705.54s)]
*  We need war part of that industrial complex is human capital [[03:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11710.58s)]
*  Do you believe that the united states keeps people in some state of desperation in order to feed that war machine? [[03:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11714.82s)]
*  Uh, no, I don't think so. I do think that there is the part of the reason that economic disparity [[03:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11721.86s)]
*  Persists and that we don't attack that economic [[03:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11729.94s)]
*  Disparity, right and i'm talking about like average income in alabama versus average income in new york. That's a huge economic disparity [[03:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11733.44s)]
*  Well, guess where most of your military recruits come from? [[03:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11739.62s)]
*  right alabama texas [[03:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11743.7s)]
*  arkansas so part of the reason that we don't prioritize fixing economic disparity is because [[03:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11746.0s)]
*  it's a convenience [[03:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11752.18s)]
*  for things like [[03:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11754.1s)]
*  recruiting militarily [[03:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11755.54s)]
*  We also have the benefit of knowing that it it really only takes one genius [[03:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11757.38s)]
*  to make [[03:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11762.82s)]
*  a billion dollars worth in tech [[03:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11764.5s)]
*  GDP or tech productivity, but it takes a lot of high school graduates to make [[03:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11767.06s)]
*  $100,000 so there's a benefit [[03:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11773.679999999998s)]
*  Efficiency wise for us to find and cultivate the most talented people in our country [[03:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11777.3s)]
*  Because they will have exponentially higher impact at the end of the day economically than the lower talented people [[03:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11781.939999999999s)]
*  So we don't we could prior instead of focusing on [[03:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11787.939999999999s)]
*  health care and [[03:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11791.699999999999s)]
*  You know whether your name tag says they or them [[03:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11793.939999999999s)]
*  We could focus on closing the economic divide but that economic divide is way too convenient for the way our structured system works [[03:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11796.9s)]
*  So I don't think they they make it happen, but they do [[03:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11803.779999999999s)]
*  Let them the aid in a bit in a way. Yeah [[03:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11807.22s)]
*  Okay, last one [[03:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11810.42s)]
*  We mentioned earlier mk ultra and stargate [[03:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11813.22s)]
*  Okay [[03:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11817.859999999999s)]
*  These programs have existed [[03:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11819.38s)]
*  Did do you know if they used them to take out a rfk's dad [[03:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11823.14s)]
*  So I know nothing about rfk's dad, okay, but here's what I will say rfk jr's dad so rfk [[03:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11829.939999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah, rfk [[03:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11835.14s)]
*  So what I what I will say is I've I have had firsthand experience with remote viewing with what they claimed about project stargate [[03:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11836.339999999998s)]
*  and [[03:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11843.46s)]
*  In every experience that i've had with remote viewing the uh, the end result [[03:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11844.5s)]
*  cannot be separated from [[03:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11851.06s)]
*  Margins of error leading up to the original start of the remote viewing [[03:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11854.98s)]
*  So for those of you who don't know what remote viewing is remote viewing is like [[03:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11858.58s)]
*  We're all going to think about [[03:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11862.5s)]
*  nothing [[03:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11864.5s)]
*  And then i'm going to say a word and you start to tell me what you associate with that word [[03:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11865.62s)]
*  And i'm gonna hope that the word that you that or the word that i'm going to prime you with is going to associate with [[03:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11870.9s)]
*  Some piece of intelligence i'm trying to collect from somewhere else [[03:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11876.5s)]
*  So obviously it's something that you do with trained remote viewers not something to do with the average person [[03:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11879.3s)]
*  So then when they're all sitting there thinking about nothing and I say orange they start talking about [[03:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11884.34s)]
*  roofs and and chains and there's a person and there's three horses around that person and I see something in the mountains and I try to [[03:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11889.12s)]
*  Align that with intelligence that says oh this is happening in the himalayas, right? [[03:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11896.9s)]
*  That's how remote viewing is supposed to work. That's what project stargate was [[03:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11901.62s)]
*  Everything that i've seen with remote viewing [[03:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11905.140000000001s)]
*  You can't associate the outcome with the input which means it's not reliable [[03:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11907.78s)]
*  And to my knowledge there has never been a piece of actionable intelligence that came from remote viewing [[03:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11912.66s)]
*  So there might be information that was useful or there might not be information that was useful [[03:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11918.34s)]
*  but for sure there was nothing that led to a [[03:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11921.86s)]
*  clear [[03:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11925.38s)]
*  Systematic confirmation that this tool works. What about mk ultra mk ultra was when they started using psychedelic drugs to try to unlock different parts of the brain [[03:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11926.74s)]
*  Yeah [[03:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11934.66s)]
*  Again to my control people right to to control people and to unlock hidden cognitive abilities, right? [[03:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11935.699999999999s)]
*  Right. So in my knowledge to my knowledge [[03:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11941.699999999999s)]
*  Neither neither outcome was ever demonstrative for the inputs they put in so they did mk ultra is no secret [[03:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11945.06s)]
*  It happened. Yeah, it was done to people who were both unwilling and unwilling [[03:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11951.3s)]
*  Remote viewing always happened to people who were willing but these are two [[03:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11956.82s)]
*  pre 9 11 cia [[03:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11960.98s)]
*  Activities that were largely driven because our opponents in the cold war were doing the same thing [[03:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11962.82s)]
*  And this is one major disadvantage. We all have to accept as americans is that because we have personal freedoms and individual rights [[03:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11968.02s)]
*  Any authoritarian country will always develop a weapon faster than we will [[03:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11975.699999999999s)]
*  Because they have fewer barriers and fewer hurdles to develop that weapon [[03:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11980.099999999999s)]
*  So they can just take someone off the street and torture them to see if that torture technique works [[03:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11984.98s)]
*  They can just take somebody off the street and pump them full of drugs to see if they can read minds [[03:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11989.699999999999s)]
*  Where we have to have five forms and all sorts of approval and like a legal chop off from an attorney [[03:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=11993.46s)]
*  It's always we're always going to be slower. That's part of the power that our forefathers put into our democracy [[03:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=12000.099999999999s)]
*  When we were talking about why it is that we are so far ahead of everybody else part of it's because we have to slow down [[03:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=12005.779999999999s)]
*  Sometimes slow is fast [[03:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=12013.14s)]
*  Andrew [[03:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=12018.099999999999s)]
*  That was awesome, where can they find you what can they watch give us all the details [[03:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pAwuzC1THk&t=12020.98s)]
