# CNN Exposed by Tim Dillon, Bernie Ep Reaction, & Knicks in 7
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU)
*  What's up everybody welcome to the number two podcast in the world. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm just saying no big deal. Okay. Thank you guys so much. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4.96s)]
*  And I'm sure all the people make a reaction video content about how we fall off. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  I'm sure you'll make videos about how we're succeeding. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=12.88s)]
*  Right. Because you're honest journalists, right. We just call it how it is. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=15.52s)]
*  So we're looking forward to last week. So you must have missed it last week when we were number three, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=19.44s)]
*  but it's okay. Now that we're number two, obviously there'll be double the amount of videos [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=23.52s)]
*  because they're honest. They're not just trying to use negativity for clicks. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=28.96s)]
*  Don't wait till we go to number four and say we've fallen off again. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=31.84s)]
*  Oh yeah. That is the strategy. You're right. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=33.92s)]
*  These have been going great since we've been a far left podcast. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=36.08s)]
*  Yo once you embrace these events, I've been trying to make this game this whole time and we've fought it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=38.32s)]
*  Dude, we're a socialist podcast. This shit is awesome. This shit is sick as hell. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=44.24s)]
*  Yo you gotta watch out man. I was watching these, I was watching this, that debate with [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=49.36s)]
*  Jordan Peterson. I was watching clips from the Jubilee. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=56.0s)]
*  I haven't seen it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=58.8s)]
*  You know, there's just a bunch of things coming up, but an interesting thing is happening. It's like [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=59.68s)]
*  whoever's like in power or whatever, your arguments get weak. Like the king don't need [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=64.0s)]
*  justification for what he does. He's the king. He goes, I want to build a parking lot over there. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=70.48s)]
*  He don't need to justify it to the, you know, transit authority why that will or won't affect [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=76.0s)]
*  traffic. He's just like, ah, build the fucking parking lot. Yeah. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=81.12s)]
*  When you're not in power control, your arguments seem to be sharp. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=83.36s)]
*  So, and I was saying this shit about Shapiro, like, you know, like Shapiro had great utility [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=86.96s)]
*  when conservatives, you know, were in power and they were getting bullied for their beliefs and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=91.68s)]
*  they didn't have, you know, good arguments to, you know, back up their lifestyle choices and then [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=96.72s)]
*  their belief system. Now that they're in power, they don't need Shapiro. And that's why, you know, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=101.28s)]
*  daily while they're struggling and the views are down and nobody really cares. He's no social utility. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=105.52s)]
*  But now that Republicans are in power again, the liberals arguments need to be incredible. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=110.4s)]
*  They're not like pink haired, armed, you know, the fucking septuples. These motherfuckers are [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=116.16000000000001s)]
*  coming with receipts. They're not playing around. They got statistics. They got stats and they're [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=121.92s)]
*  ready to go. And they're just like, the one dude from the clip, I have to watch, I guess, more of [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=126.64s)]
*  the whole interview, the Jubilee, but it looked like he was cooking Jordan. He's like, you [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=131.84s)]
*  Christians looking shaky in the light right now. It was kind of like the people who are wearing [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=136.08s)]
*  Christianity as a, as like a costume. Some people, and he was like, yo, it's kind of like what Wes [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  said. He's like, either you in or you out is not like, I'm kind of into Christian values. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=150.08s)]
*  Christians are making a comeback because to your point, they were kind of not mainstream for a [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=155.60000000000002s)]
*  little while. It was kind of like being atheist or being agnostic or being spiritual was what it was. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=162.24s)]
*  So the Christians were just sharpening the swords, getting the arguments ready. And now, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=166.4s)]
*  now let's go. And think about that, right? All these, you know, social media influencers that, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  you know, fake jumped to Islam because they thought that that was their only way out. If [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=175.60000000000002s)]
*  they just waited like four more months, they could have stayed Christian. Now they got to burn in hell. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=178.56s)]
*  You know, not my rules. Not my rules. I see you there. I don't know about that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=186.08s)]
*  We all gonna be there as well. We got to choose up. Anyway, it was just, it's interesting to see and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=190.4s)]
*  like call it whatever you want. It is kind of cool that you've heard this expression, like the free [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=195.76000000000002s)]
*  marketplace of ideas, like it is kind of operating in that way. There's a lag and it takes time, but [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=201.76s)]
*  this is what we want. And if you go like zoom out and look in like 10 year periods, you'd be like, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=208.72s)]
*  wow, this is kind of cool. What's happening. These people get in control. These people go, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=213.36s)]
*  okay, we need better arguments so that we can get control. They develop better arguments. They get [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=218.0s)]
*  control. These people go, okay, we need better arguments. And this is constant back and forth. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=222.08s)]
*  And hopefully it pushes us to a good place. If you are exploiting a demographic to get money, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=225.6s)]
*  eventually when that happens, when you get to that position and you're not sharp, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=230.8s)]
*  fold right back down, right back down, you know, or people just say you're exploiting things and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=235.04s)]
*  then you just become the number two podcast. No, no, no, no big deal. We're looking forward to all [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=239.28s)]
*  the videos guys. We know you're honest journalists and not just doing clickbait titles and changing [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=244.16s)]
*  your thumbnails constantly so you can get views because you don't anymore. Good to be on top. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=248.64s)]
*  No, we love you. Thank you for all the press. Okay. What's up with y'all man? How was your [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=260.88s)]
*  Memorial Day? Yeah, I had a great Memorial Day weekend, man. So my best friend, I went to Philly [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=265.52s)]
*  underrated city. My wife's best friend's wedding was rated. I gotta push back on that. It is rated. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=270.56s)]
*  This is the guy who complains about Manhattan. This is how you complain about Manhattan. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=278.16s)]
*  Akash is an expectation reality person. We're all that way, but he's the most extreme. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=283.6s)]
*  I could be very, yeah, I'm not gonna argue with any of this. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=288.64s)]
*  You know how he has a great analysis on me? Like every time he talks about me, I'm like, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=291.92s)]
*  you fucking, we've been friends for 20 years. He's an expectation. If I build something up too big [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=295.68s)]
*  for Akash, it will never meet those expectations. Because he believes the expectation. I worship [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=303.44s)]
*  this guy. Reaction video. Can you believe comedians have fun on a podcast together? What a crazy idea. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=309.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, they even laugh at each other's jokes. What an insane idea that someone with no friends [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=321.2s)]
*  doesn't understand how friends laugh with each other. Wow. Anyway, okay. So you go, so yeah, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=337.68s)]
*  if somebody goes, yo, this is the best restaurant, you're like, okay, it's the best restaurant. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=346.15999999999997s)]
*  You're the person that says everything's the best. Because everything is the best to me. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=350.08s)]
*  He's the person that's always disappointed. Me and Derek Poston are golden retrievers with a [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=353.03999999999996s)]
*  shiny new tennis ball that doesn't shine, but a fluffy new tennis ball. That's who we are. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=359.11999999999995s)]
*  It is just whatever we try is the best thing that we've ever had in our life until we try [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=363.59999999999997s)]
*  another thing and we forget about that one. But I got to see Jelly Roll. Oh, wait. Jelly Roll [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=367.59999999999997s)]
*  was in Philly. Amazing. So we met up, we actually played basketball. Jelly Roll's losing all this [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=371.76s)]
*  weight. He's playing basketball every day. It's like a fun old guy run. I know he was [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=375.84s)]
*  getting skinny because he doesn't wear the hokas anymore. So I'm in normal people shoes. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  And then I went to go see him with Post Malone at the Philly Stadium. Where do they play? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=386.96s)]
*  City Field or whatever. And I went to go see him. I snuck out of a wedding. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=390.88s)]
*  I went for like an hour. Piece of shit. Not piece of shit, it's day four. Oh yeah. I was there for [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=395.52s)]
*  the important part. I saw them getting married. I snuck out of the reception. My wife was in a [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=402.64s)]
*  dance. I missed a little bit of the dance, but she gave me permission. She was like, go. Back to being [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=406.15999999999997s)]
*  a piece of shit. I missed 30 seconds of dance. Made it back in time. She gave him permission. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=410.08s)]
*  Look at his eye. Does it look like it's a tradition? Is that what it looks like? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=414.64s)]
*  That macron video. And I kind of said to the group, he's like, it's disrespectful what wise [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=425.12s)]
*  will do. This is horrific. There's got to be laws against this. Did you see his press release? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=430.24s)]
*  Macron was like, it was a joke. We're just goofing. All right. All right. I'm being beaten up by an [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=437.52s)]
*  elderly man. Just boys being boys. I'd say that. That's a lot of room for him. Look at him. The way [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=443.04s)]
*  his face locks in. This is wild. This is the office. This is literally wild. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=454.56s)]
*  I just fire. Why do I always have to suck your dick on a bus? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=463.92s)]
*  Allegedly though. Allegedly. That was some man's shit. That was. That felt feminine. I agree with [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=470.72s)]
*  Mark here. It's the first time that I thought that his wife might actually be a woman. Oh really? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=480.16s)]
*  Because she double pushed the face. I only saw one hand. No, there's two hands. I only saw one. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=483.68s)]
*  To me a double mush of is. But I feel women it's slap. It's the no power slap. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=488.08s)]
*  Alex is like, I don't really want to have the baby. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=502.8s)]
*  Power slap is a good lead. I would take open head slap over punch any day. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=513.68s)]
*  But the mush, I think we've said it before, is like the most disrespectful. Oh god, dude. It's the [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=519.04s)]
*  most disrespectful fucking disrespectful thing in the world. In front of all your people. Oh my god, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=522.88s)]
*  on camera. That lives forever, dude. I'd rather not be president. Be president and get mushed [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=529.3599999999999s)]
*  by my wife one time. What do you think? You think he like stole her blue chew? What do you think [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=536.4799999999999s)]
*  happened? Like what? Candice, this is your fault, Candice. It is. None of us thought this was even [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=542.32s)]
*  a possibility before you started bringing this up and it's far too interesting for us to ignore. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=550.0s)]
*  Don't worry about the, what is it, the truth of the lie is more entertaining. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=555.6s)]
*  Yes, it's true. That's exactly what happened. That's also child abuse, ain't it? She like 70s. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=559.04s)]
*  Right? Yeah. If it is her kid. Yeah, right? His kid. No. Well, if Macron's wife is actually his dad [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=565.2s)]
*  and his dad is beaten on him. That's abuse. That's CPS. We gotta call CPS, man. Yeah. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=578.5600000000001s)]
*  Or a good parent. Yeah. Potato patato. I think this proves she's for sure a woman. Because like, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=583.76s)]
*  why would you be so confident to abuse your husband in public when he's like, bro, I have [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=590.24s)]
*  the biggest nuclear bomb on you ever. Cause she's a wife, bro. You have a very unique [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=594.8s)]
*  circumstance with your wife where you get to do whatever you want and she's just cool with it. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=599.5999999999999s)]
*  I haven't been abused yet. My wife is borderline abusing me. I had to say this weekend at one [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=604.0799999999999s)]
*  point, like, why are you talking to me like this in front of people? Now I'm not even, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=609.12s)]
*  now I'm not even like, I'm just accepted the talking to me like this. I'm like, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=618.64s)]
*  not doing it in front of our friends. I'm concerned about my friends losing respect for me. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=622.5600000000001s)]
*  Okay. There's no recourse. There's nothing I can do. So can you not talk to me like this in front [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=628.8000000000001s)]
*  of them at least? Text me. That's it. You know, the only defense is to just laugh at them. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=633.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good one. And now I look like you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely. Like an enforcer [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=639.76s)]
*  for a shitty hockey team. But if you keep laughing, sometimes they'll laugh. Sometimes you get in [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=644.4000000000001s)]
*  bigger trouble, but you're already in trouble. Who cares? So you just start laughing when I just [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=648.72s)]
*  smile. Man, I got to try that one. That would drive my wife crazy. You would grab the heaviest [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=651.6800000000001s)]
*  shit. I don't know if I'm ready to do all that. You know, real heck that drives them crazy. I'll [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=656.96s)]
*  give her an empty apology. Yeah. And then she'll go, I go, you're right. I'm sorry with like nothing [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=666.96s)]
*  in my eyes. Don't apologize if you don't mean it. And I go, you're right. I'm sorry. Even less. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=671.52s)]
*  And then when she gets mad, I'm like, what? I'm apologizing. How can you be mad at me? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=679.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, this black guy makes sense. Yeah, the only thing I do is I have a wet dream loud in front of [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=682.24s)]
*  her. What the fuck? Once I notice I'm nothing, I just start going, oh, so good to come again. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=687.76s)]
*  Jealous? Man, it's been so long since I had sex. It's crazy. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=702.08s)]
*  I'm out of time. And she keeps inviting her family. I'm like, what are you trying to make happen to me? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=708.8000000000001s)]
*  What are you trying to make happen to me? I got a bone of shit in the other day. I don't know what [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=714.96s)]
*  that means. I don't know what that means. I don't know what that means. I don't know what that means. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=718.1600000000001s)]
*  When my dick hit the bottom of the toilet seat, it started to come up. I'm like, what the fuck is [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=724.4s)]
*  going on? He's splashing up against me. I'm like, what is happening right now? I need to have sex [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=729.0400000000001s)]
*  immediately. I need to have sex immediately. It's good to know you still got it like that. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=735.44s)]
*  I thought I did. Only going out. Prostate tickled. Honestly, maybe it's that. Maybe it's that. I'm so [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=740.5600000000001s)]
*  backed up the second my prostate felt any pressure. I remember I had it. Everything bagel, two eggs, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=746.5600000000001s)]
*  American cheese, and bacon extra crispy. I tried to take a shit and my dick slapped the front of [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=753.6s)]
*  the fucking toilet from the inside. What is that? That's a form of abuse to me. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=758.96s)]
*  That's a form of abuse. Remember that person that kept their whole family in a basement in Cleveland [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=768.88s)]
*  so that they didn't have to experience Cleveland and we thought that he was a villain? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=774.32s)]
*  Just let them out once a week and they'd be like, man, put me back in that fucking [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=782.5600000000001s)]
*  Anyway, how you guys have a good [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=789.76s)]
*  I'm so proud of this fucking guy. Do 40,000 people. You're going backstage and seeing [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=797.6800000000001s)]
*  40,000 people. He put me on a little golf cart with him before he went out there. I was side stage, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=803.2800000000001s)]
*  but the craziest part is when you're on the golf cart and you just see every fucking [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=807.52s)]
*  caddy. I was in the back. I sat in the back like a black guy. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=811.0400000000001s)]
*  Just seeing 40,000 people going nuts and then he goes out there, huge pop. They sing a song [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=816.0s)]
*  together and it was just so fucking cool to see Jelly. He's so insanely famous. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=819.76s)]
*  I think I might've said this on a pie. I forget what it was, but he is a phenomenal performer. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=825.76s)]
*  And the only way that you can really learn how to be an amazing performer is by doing shitty shows [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=833.52s)]
*  for a decade or two and really learning how to connect and move a crowd. I think there's a lot [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=838.96s)]
*  of people who like, maybe they come up in like the Disney circuit or a pop song will go crazy and [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=844.5600000000001s)]
*  they never suffered through doing a shitty show in the back of a fucking barn. Like, and I'm not [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=849.9200000000001s)]
*  trying to comedians horns here, but like for most comedians, it takes like a decade doing horrible [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=855.12s)]
*  shows around the country and you learn how to win in those environments. And you see a guy like him [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=859.9200000000001s)]
*  who's done that for 20 fucking years and then he blows up and I watched him when we were in Miami. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=865.52s)]
*  He's at Carbone beach in Miami. Now this is Jelly Roll. Is that probably what you would think is [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=871.28s)]
*  the least Jelly Roll-esque environment that he could be in? Right? Probably. Like, yeah, Latinos, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=876.0s)]
*  crypto, billionaire, like just the most Miami. It's formula one weekend. It's like you wouldn't [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=883.3599999999999s)]
*  think it's Jelly. Within 60 seconds of being on stage, the whole room. Yeah. Yeah. Focused on him, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=889.04s)]
*  ready to party, ready to have a good time. And it's just when you say that he was just rocking, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=897.28s)]
*  it's just this is what happens when you put in the fucking work. And it's just, yeah, it's amazing. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=902.3199999999999s)]
*  Also guys, tour dates, akashceng.com. I know we go into Salt Lake City, June 19th through 21st. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=907.4399999999999s)]
*  A lot of other dates we're going to add, but I dropped a little, it's not quite as special, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=912.9599999999999s)]
*  but it's kind of a special. I got high on 420, did shrooms and went on stage. Had a blast. If [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=917.36s)]
*  you want to check it out, go to my YouTube page. It's also on my TikTok. We'll upload clips on [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=923.12s)]
*  Instagram, but YouTube got the full special. Akash Singh 420 show. I think it's called Stand [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=926.88s)]
*  Up on Shrooms for now, but just look for it. It's fun. Love y'all. Thank you. Hello, beautiful [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=932.32s)]
*  people. World's fastest dates for you. Okay. Tonight, New York City. I got a show of Mary [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=935.92s)]
*  Lou. It's going to be awesome. You can get tickets on my website or my bio. And then I'm going to [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=939.6800000000001s)]
*  Buffalo, Raleigh, Poughkeepsie, Portland, Fort Worth, Austin, Texas, Stanford, Philadelphia, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=943.52s)]
*  a bunch of other places. You can get it on my website, Mark Gagnon Live. All the tour dates [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=950.64s)]
*  will be there. I can't wait to see you guys at the shows. Goodbye. And Post was awesome too. I saw [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=954.72s)]
*  Post and I was like, this guy is like so fucking gifted as a musician. I think Post got, he has [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=958.64s)]
*  the ear. When you see people cross genres like that, some people can play music really well, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=966.9599999999999s)]
*  but they don't know how to make a great song. I don't even know if he plays instruments that [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=975.1999999999999s)]
*  well. He played the guitar. He played it well. But I don't know if he's a Stevie Ray Vaughn or a [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=980.3199999999999s)]
*  Jimi Hendrix, but I think his ear is elite. We're talking about Kodak like this. He just has a [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=984.48s)]
*  musical sensibility that he can understand if it's good or not. What's the Louis Vuitton guy that [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=989.6s)]
*  the LVMH guy? Furrow. Virgil Edelman. No, Virgil or like the LVMH, Arnaud, whatever. It's just like, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=996.48s)]
*  it's taste. It's just like some people have it. They know what looks good. They know what feels [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1004.5600000000001s)]
*  good. They know what sounds good. And I think that might be the difference maker for him. Because [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1010.24s)]
*  literally came out with a rap song and it was fire. Does country, it's fire. And with him, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1016.8000000000001s)]
*  it doesn't feel like hopping to a market. It just feels like he wants to do all that. It feels very [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1022.48s)]
*  natural. He loves music. In the beginning, it looked a little hopping. Well, Charlamagne put [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1026.96s)]
*  the fucking pressure on. It was Indiana Pacers, 94 feet. What are you doing for black people? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1031.84s)]
*  He's like making music so you can get some ass too. But it was crazy. He came in with a jersey, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1037.28s)]
*  cornrows and stuff like that. And then he switched that real quick. I also did that. But now it's like [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1044.88s)]
*  white people use cornrows as a way to look cool, man. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1048.72s)]
*  Both of y'all's pictures. That's funny. You got one too. I had a cornrow face. It was a week. I did [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1058.72s)]
*  it for homecoming week in high school and they said, you got to take those out. They made you [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1063.6000000000001s)]
*  change your hairstyle. I went to a private school and I was like, don't touch my hair. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1066.88s)]
*  Yeah. They try to make me take it off. That's fire, bro. It actually looks good. That's Spanish. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1071.68s)]
*  Yeah, you do it. You become poppy. I'm Spanish orthodox, bro. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1076.8s)]
*  All right. So tell me, this concert was amazing. Yeah, it was so great. And just seeing, again, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1082.24s)]
*  seeing Jelly Roll, like James Hadfield from Metallica is in the green room and like, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1086.3999999999999s)]
*  and this is a guy, it was cool for me to meet him because he's just like a legend. But Jelly [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1091.6799999999998s)]
*  like looks up to this guy and he was like, I'm just, this guy's coming. It was like to see him [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1094.8799999999999s)]
*  in that element and I'm watching people when they react to him, it's they're losing their fucking [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1100.3999999999999s)]
*  minds and he handles it all so great. You always handle it really well too. But I just see him, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1105.28s)]
*  these things I noticed about both you guys, you just, there's no discomfort with it. And it's [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1109.68s)]
*  cool that he's still doing towards these massive acts when he could be headlining. He said, the [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1112.8799999999999s)]
*  reason I do it is because I keep learning from people. And he was like, when I watch posts, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1117.28s)]
*  I see how comfortable he is up there and how he takes his time and he doesn't press. And he goes, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1121.04s)]
*  me and I have actually learned this from you early on. I always feel like, okay, what's this? What's [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1124.48s)]
*  this? What's this? And I see you just really take time and be like, it's, we're all good. There's a [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1129.2s)]
*  confidence that's like, everything's going to be good. I'm going to take my time. I'm going to find [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1133.76s)]
*  the best moments. I'm going to find whatever. And Jelly is like, I learned that from posts. That's [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1137.04s)]
*  what I learned this tour. The next tour, I'm going to go with somebody else. I'm going to learn [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1140.64s)]
*  something else. And it's so egoist. Like he could probably headline, sell out whatever on his own. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1143.28s)]
*  And he's like, nah, I'll split money, whatever, however they work it out. I don't know. But like, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1148.96s)]
*  I'll do it with this guy and I'll learn something from him. And do the biggest thing. Yeah. Who's [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1153.04s)]
*  going to say no to a Jelly Post show? I mean, it's an insane show. That was an insane, I didn't even [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1157.6s)]
*  understand when he said he was doing the Phillies, I just assumed it was him. And then to see posts, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1162.08s)]
*  it's post shows like, oh, that's crazy. I mean, the Eminem show is crazy, bro. I mean, all times. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1166.32s)]
*  Jelly started out as a rapper. Think about that. Yeah. Like imagine Eminem shows up to one. Now, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1172.24s)]
*  greater, they got the song together. Yeah. But still like Eminem doesn't show up for anything. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1176.8s)]
*  Eminem shows up for Detroit and 50 Cent and Dr. Dre. Yeah. And that's it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I love [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1181.52s)]
*  the way he's living life. But then he goes to see Jelly. Doug, when we played basketball, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1188.56s)]
*  he was like, pull up, we're going to be hooping. They're at the 76ers practice facility. Like, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1192.3999999999999s)]
*  they're just opening it up for Jelly and his boys to go play ball. And it's like, I said to him, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=1196.3999999999999s)]

*  They're not standing up to weeks of torture. But he did that. Oh, you're on my side. That's why I'm with you. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2309.3599999999997s)]
*  It's fugazi. Don't add up. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Is there more to the story, Joey? What actually happened? So he gets [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2312.96s)]
*  tortured. How? He gets tortured, electrocuted, pistol whipped. They take him to the fifth floor of the [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2317.6s)]
*  building, threatened to throw him off. Eventually, it's like, I'm going to give you my crypto, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2326.24s)]
*  my passwords on my laptop. When they went to go get the laptop, that's when he made his escape. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2331.3599999999997s)]
*  Whoa. They left the room and he ran out barefoot. Everyone left the room. Yeah. Everyone. What in the [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2336.48s)]
*  fuck is that? Everyone. Hey, guys, let's all go over there. He was an Italian guy. He was Italian. He was [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2342.3199999999997s)]
*  Italian. Oh, well, I think we need to see reenactment of what he might have said to the police when he [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2348.96s)]
*  went over there. Do you think he looked like Scholz a little? Scholz, what do you think he said when he went to the police? [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2354.72s)]
*  They tried to take my ateriome. They tried to take my ateriome. They pistol whipped me in my face. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2359.7599999999998s)]
*  They pistol whipped me in my face. I have a one mochiato in one week. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2368.64s)]
*  I'm so tired. I have only one mochiato in one week. They take my ateriome, my XRP. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2373.3599999999997s)]
*  They take all my XRP in my ateriome. His name is Tiofastro Carturan. Oh, Michael Valentino. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2378.4s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. The walls are so thin in New York City. You would have heard that shit. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2394.08s)]
*  This is no LIDA. Every wall is made out of cardboard. There's no way in hell they tortured [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2399.04s)]
*  this guy for two weeks without anybody knowing. I don't believe it. So what do you think happened? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2404.4s)]
*  I think they were all in on it or something like that together and then they tried to put a little [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2408.48s)]
*  pressure on him but he knew that they weren't going to do anything fucked up to him. If you [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2412.2400000000002s)]
*  waterboard somebody they just tell you. Do you remember when we waterboarded each other? [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2416.32s)]
*  You were there. Yeah, I know. Just for content. Such white. What? We should clarify this for a video. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2421.6s)]
*  It's a video of us waterboarding each other on YouTube right now. We just wanted to see how [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2428.96s)]
*  effective it was. Incredibly effective. Yeah. Is this the guy? After he escaped. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2432.32s)]
*  Whoa, what? Wait, he got a robe? You didn't tell him to give him a robe? This is Four Seasons? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2438.56s)]
*  What the fuck are we talking about? This is some gay shit. I promise you this was like a gay tryst. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2445.1200000000003s)]
*  Just because they're Italian, really? That's him? You're telling me you're not going to hear [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2449.1200000000003s)]
*  something? It's also funny. They said they put an air tag around his neck so they could find him [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2455.1200000000003s)]
*  in the house. It's like you just had him in a room. How big is the house? Yeah, oh yeah. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2459.44s)]
*  Yo, the guy gets the whole house? Yeah, he had eight bedrooms to walk around in apparently. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2464.56s)]
*  No, I don't understand. This is a fake story, Doug. Can you guys explain this to me about crypto [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2469.04s)]
*  though? What is the... So the idea is that you can't track the money. Like you know it's exchanging [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2474.08s)]
*  from wallet to wallet but you can't track the wallet to a person. Is that the idea? I guess, [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2480.48s)]
*  hypothetically, it's just an anonymous wallet with a code. Got it. So that's why it's easier [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2486.0s)]
*  to get away with stealing somebody's crypto. Yeah, I think so. Because we know where it is on the [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2492.2400000000002s)]
*  blockchain. We just don't know how that blockchain connects to a person. Yeah, it's not registered [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2497.6000000000004s)]
*  to anyone. And then what is the cost of registering it to somebody? Why does that inhibit the freedom [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2501.84s)]
*  of Bitcoin? I might be making the argument for a bank right now, so excuse me if I am, but [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2508.48s)]
*  wouldn't you rather your crypto be registered toward to you in the event that if someone stole [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2514.08s)]
*  it and then it went to another account, you could find who that account was registered to. Yeah, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2521.7599999999998s)]
*  and that probably creates a security risk where you have billionaires and you know exactly who [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2525.8399999999997s)]
*  they are. And then they're sending money to other people and now you would know the nefarious things [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2529.44s)]
*  that people are doing with their money? I mean, that was like to steal a minute, just be like, [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2535.68s)]
*  yeah, it's a security risk. I don't want people knowing that I just got paid $5 million in Bitcoin [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2538.96s)]
*  and they have my name and they can find my address. Got it. So you have your own wallet [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2544.48s)]
*  information. So if you wanted to disclose that you can to try to track ship, but for all the people [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2549.76s)]
*  trying to do illegal ship, they're like, okay, I want to get away with this shit. It makes sense [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2554.1600000000003s)]
*  for the illegal stuff, but it is a huge security risk when you think about it. You know, the fact [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2558.88s)]
*  that like, you know your crypto password and somebody could kidnap you in your house. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2564.64s)]
*  Like if anybody is a crypto billionaire, you have to have 24 hour security because [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2570.64s)]
*  the cost of just locking you up and transferring the money is super high. Yeah, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2576.3199999999997s)]
*  or don't tell anyone. You are a crypto billionaire. But some of these guys are on yachts and doing the [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2582.4s)]
*  whole thing in Miami. They thought they were living sweet, but you know. The best whole thing was [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2587.7599999999998s)]
*  Satoshi, right? Like the dude that started, no one knows who it is and he has like all this, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2592.8s)]
*  you know, all these Bitcoin holdings or whatever. Right. But like no one knows him [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2596.32s)]
*  despite people knowing what his wallet is. Is it fucked up? I have zero sympathy for [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2600.2400000000002s)]
*  kidnapping crypto billionaires. Tell me, tell me, tell me. I don't know. I just don't feel bad [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2604.7200000000003s)]
*  about it. They like gambled. They made a lot of money gambling. It's like, yeah. Yeah. It feels [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2609.04s)]
*  like gray area crime. Like it's not literally crime, but it's like you're doing street shit. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2614.4s)]
*  If you get caught up, it's like, I do think you have to understand if you make a lot of money [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2619.2000000000003s)]
*  in crypto, nobody feels any sympathy if anything bad happens to you. They feel like you don't [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2622.16s)]
*  deserve it. And that's just who cares? Because everybody who's been in crypto was just like, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2625.68s)]
*  you guys don't get it. You guys are idiots. Blah, blah, blah. I was like that. I just didn't make [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2629.7599999999998s)]
*  any money. Now you didn't make any money. Now that Bitcoin is an all time high. I didn't make [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2633.2799999999997s)]
*  any money. I got it. We got to figure out who stole my shit. But yeah, it's like you got to [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2640.72s)]
*  understand the cost that comes with that is nobody feels any sympathy for you and just deal with that. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2646.24s)]
*  That is what it is. So anything bad happens to you. But it is like winning the lottery. You got [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2649.92s)]
*  to keep quiet about it. Yeah. But if you, if you felt, if you were the banks and you actually felt [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2653.2000000000003s)]
*  like crypto was threatening your institution, it would behoove you to pay people to go out and rob [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2657.6s)]
*  big crypto holders because then they would say, Hey, we need some sort of regulatory body for crypto. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2665.84s)]
*  So we could track the money. Because if you take my money from my bank and put it into your bank, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2672.64s)]
*  doesn't matter where it is. It could be in the Cayman Island somewhere. We could at least track [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2678.3199999999997s)]
*  it to a bank account in the Cayman Islands and probably track that to some trust that is owned [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2682.16s)]
*  or you're on the board of. And then the SEC, you can put pressure on the bank to reverse it, [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2687.8399999999997s)]
*  get the funds back, et cetera. So I wonder if enough of this happens that people start to go, [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2691.8399999999997s)]
*  Hey, the, what is it called? The decentralization of money is great, but it does put you in incredible [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2696.16s)]
*  risk. So maybe it's like, Ooh, this is tricky. Like you have to be completely silent about being [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2704.4s)]
*  a crypto billionaire, which is, I feel like at this stage, like almost impossible. Yeah. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2711.6s)]
*  If you're really into the community, you know, the big holders are. Yeah. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2715.28s)]
*  Yeah. I don't know how you fix this problem. Like, I mean, kidnapping a person and taking [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2720.8s)]
*  whatever's in their house is probably the same time in jail as kidnapping a person [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2726.96s)]
*  and exchanging hundreds of millions of dollars in crypto. Yeah. The upside on the cycle one is crazy. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2732.56s)]
*  That's why like the upside of like robbing somebody's Rolex was so high, right? It's like, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2738.7200000000003s)]
*  if I take your iPhone or your Rolex, it's still a felony. So I might as well take your Rolex and get [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2743.12s)]
*  a hundred grand, then take your iPhone. So it's almost like having the same punishment for anything [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2748.16s)]
*  over $500 almost incentivizes people to kidnap and rob for crypto. Whoa. Yeah. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2754.4s)]
*  Well, you have to torture them for the password. Like you can't just take their wallet. It's [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2763.84s)]
*  already password protected. That's where crime elevates. You have to get the password. Yeah. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2767.84s)]
*  Their watch is just a watch. Oh, I know how to stop this. It's like you and you don't need like an [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2774.48s)]
*  official regulatory committee, but you basically get your money manager, whoever it is, like your [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2779.2s)]
*  business partner, you get them to be a secondary sign off on any transfer of funds. So you got to [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2784.64s)]
*  get us both. So you got to get us both. And like it has to be both in person. It can't be just a [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2791.12s)]
*  phone call. Right. So you can't move money as easily, but at least you are protected. Yeah. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2795.68s)]
*  That's a good idea. And somebody take it. They have to do something about this. Two key. Yeah. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2800.3999999999996s)]
*  Two factor IRL. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We don't have this problem. So we got the Winklevosses a few [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2803.92s)]
*  blocks down the road. How has nobody kidnapped them? Let's get these motherfuckers. No, no, no. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2811.36s)]
*  I'm working so hard. No, I need to meet these guys. Let's get these. Pay me back what I lost. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2816.0s)]
*  They owe that to you. Yeah. You built them up. I've done so much for them. You really have. I've done [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2823.04s)]
*  so much for you. We have Pomp on the podcast multiple times. That's true. They can give you [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2828.2400000000002s)]
*  back a coin or two. Yeah, two. These guys are billionaires for no reason twice. Isn't that [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2832.72s)]
*  crazy? That's nuts. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah. You almost have to think it's for a reason if it's [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2840.56s)]
*  for no reason twice. Yeah. I guess so. If it's no reason twice. But it's so weird. Like when a girl [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2844.64s)]
*  gets twice, you don't feel that way. Cause you wouldn't apply that same. Mark specifically said this many times. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2849.2799999999997s)]
*  Hold on. Mark, you wouldn't have. You wouldn't have applied that the other way at all. It depends. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2859.2s)]
*  What's the time frame? What's the. Wow. You're bringing it up. You're bringing it up. Mark would [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2866.0s)]
*  have rubbed come on the nipples. You would have had second hand, what did we call it? [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2871.52s)]
*  Second hand gay. What was the thing we called them? Brilliant idiots. I think it was second hand gay. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2878.56s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. You would have had that. Yeah. No, no, no. I denounced sexual misconduct. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2882.64s)]
*  I don't want to get political on the pod, but I do. I do believe you. What's not getting political on this podcast? [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2888.8799999999997s)]
*  What else is going on in the world? The Knicks, dude. Oh, obviously. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2894.56s)]
*  Obviously. Obviously you're down to one. Obviously down pointing. Obviously we're [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2900.24s)]
*  Nicking right now. Obviously Nick's a Nickin. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2905.12s)]
*  So game for us tonight. How you feel? Well, that's easy. That's easy dub. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2912.4s)]
*  We got it now. We figured the whole thing out. What was the, what'd you figure out? [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2916.64s)]
*  I mean, do you want my honest? Yeah. I want your honest, your honest opinion. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2920.7999999999997s)]
*  Every steak listener right now is tuned in. Okay. This is, I, you know, we love Josh Hart. New York [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2927.36s)]
*  Knicks love Josh Hart. This is our most beloved player. Obviously we love Brunson, his ability to score, but like in terms of like who represents the heart and the grit of the city is Josh. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2933.44s)]
*  But when Josh is out there, he's not a threat offensively. So you can just let Halliburton guard him. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2944.8s)]
*  So Halliburton is the person on defense that is the biggest liability. So when you take [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2951.12s)]
*  Josh out and you put someone who can score on Halliburton, you can take advantage of that. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2959.2s)]
*  Also having Mitch come in and just cause chaos on the boards, cause chaos on the offensive boards. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2964.72s)]
*  I mean, it's been crazy what he's doing and like really doing damage defensively at the rim. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2969.68s)]
*  You know, I think it changed the game a little bit, but also like we just put the bench in and let the bench run with it. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2976.08s)]
*  And I think what happened is we got a little complacent. Barclay said something like, you know, Brunson, you've got to trust your teammates. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2981.3599999999997s)]
*  And it's not like he doesn't trust his teammates. He just trusts his own ability to get a bucket whenever he needs. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2986.08s)]
*  But you also want your other guys to be able to feel like they are trusted to score. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2992.16s)]
*  So he got into some foul trouble and the other guys had to pick up the slack and Cat went crazy. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=2998.08s)]
*  I think we're relying on three too much. Cat needs to take his zesty ass to the hole. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3003.2s)]
*  He's got to drive more. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3009.92s)]
*  Cat is the greatest big man shooter in NBA history. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3011.2s)]
*  Yeah, I've heard this. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3015.76s)]
*  In NBA history? [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3016.88s)]
*  Percentage wise. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3018.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3018.8s)]
*  He's like a fucking great 3.3. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3019.44s)]
*  He is the greatest. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3020.96s)]
*  And I just said, he should stop shooting. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3021.84s)]
*  Cause I didn't get it. Cause sometimes he'll pull up from like damn near the logo. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3024.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm like, what is going on? I didn't realize he's a better shooter statistically than Dirk. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3027.36s)]
*  Cat is the greatest shooting big man in NBA history. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3031.28s)]
*  And I think a lot of us that look at him and we're like, man, you're so big. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3034.7200000000003s)]
*  Just take it to the basket and dunk on these motherfuckers. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3037.84s)]
*  His game is shooting and then kind of chilling on D. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3039.84s)]
*  And we got to kind of embrace that and then bring Mitchell Robinson in [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3043.76s)]
*  to hold down the D where Cat's not going to do it. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3048.32s)]
*  But Cat had a 20.4 quarter. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3051.28s)]
*  Yeah, Cat's been playing well, man. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3053.36s)]
*  And he's not afraid of the moment. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3055.04s)]
*  That's the hard thing. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3056.16s)]
*  Yo, Nick's got to chill with this zesty ass shit until the playoffs is over. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3056.8s)]
*  Like we're not going to be criticizing the guy who's dropping 20 in the fourth quarter [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3060.0s)]
*  and calling him gay the day afterwards. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3064.0s)]
*  But that was, you know, out of love. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3066.16s)]
*  After we win the championship. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3068.8s)]
*  How I call y'all zesty. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3069.44s)]
*  I love y'all motherfuckers. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3070.7200000000003s)]
*  You have some zesty. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3071.76s)]
*  So once we win the championship, give them a float in the parade or whatever, but don't [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3072.8s)]
*  say shit until then. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3080.6400000000003s)]
*  Also, he's not really more zesty than the average Dominican. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3084.0s)]
*  Like Dominicans embrace the zest. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3088.0s)]
*  That's true. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3090.0800000000004s)]
*  They got the rhinos on pants. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3090.5600000000004s)]
*  It's more of a cultural effect. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3091.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3093.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3093.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3095.36s)]
*  They dance with their hips. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3097.1200000000003s)]
*  It's like they got a different family in Dominican Republic to prove that they're not gay. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3098.08s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3103.04s)]
*  So they'll have a family here and a family there. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3103.92s)]
*  The second you think they're gay, they'll be like, yeah, but I got kids my wife don't [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3105.6s)]
*  know about you. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3107.92s)]
*  They're like, ah, you're straight on the front of my legs. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3108.3199999999997s)]
*  So it's baby cat got to do that. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3110.16s)]
*  But in terms of making fun of our star big man who's shooting lights out and keeping [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3112.08s)]
*  us in games, we got to squash that for a few more weeks. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3118.7999999999997s)]
*  What happened in game one? [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3122.08s)]
*  How does game one even? [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3122.88s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3124.08s)]
*  I don't know what I'm talking about. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3125.04s)]
*  I thought it was over. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3125.44s)]
*  And then I saw y'all's text and I was like, what happened? [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3126.48s)]
*  I stopped watching. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3129.6s)]
*  Did you leave before? [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3130.2400000000002s)]
*  That was the game you went to? [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3131.36s)]
*  No, no, I wasn't live at that game. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3132.32s)]
*  I was watching on TV. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3133.68s)]
*  Gotcha, gotcha. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3134.48s)]
*  Sorry, that was heartbreaking. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3135.2s)]
*  Yeah, it was. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3137.04s)]
*  I sent a text to my wife. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3137.52s)]
*  My wife went up to sleep. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3138.96s)]
*  I go, Nick's are up 17 with three minutes left. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3141.04s)]
*  We got this. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3144.56s)]
*  And then I immediately text her back because, you know, I'm superstitious. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3145.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3148.0s)]
*  Like, shit, I take that back. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3148.32s)]
*  I might have jinxed it. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3150.08s)]
*  Too late. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3151.52s)]
*  You got to hit unsend. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3153.2s)]
*  I couldn't believe it. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3154.16s)]
*  Believe what I was watching. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3155.7599999999998s)]
*  How does that happen? [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3157.68s)]
*  It's just like bad. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3158.56s)]
*  I've never seen anything like that. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3160.0s)]
*  They went lights out shooting. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3161.44s)]
*  I think they had like eight. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3162.64s)]
*  That guy James Lee Smith hit like six in the fourth or something like that. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3163.68s)]
*  Six three-porters. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3166.4s)]
*  But also I just never. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3167.28s)]
*  And then Halle's last shot, what a favorable bounce, but like crazy. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3168.24s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3172.32s)]
*  I went to game two. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3172.96s)]
*  That was heartbreaking. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3174.0s)]
*  So here's what I don't. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3176.24s)]
*  Heartbreaking. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3177.44s)]
*  I know the Pacers are talented, but on paper, the Knicks are so much more talented. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3177.92s)]
*  So they got, they run an incredible pace. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3181.7599999999998s)]
*  So what they do is like, first of all, they pick up 94 feet. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3184.32s)]
*  Right? [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3188.56s)]
*  So by the time what that means is they do a full court press, which is very rare in the NBA [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3188.88s)]
*  because you have the best ball handlers in the history of the sport that are bringing up the ball. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3193.1200000000003s)]
*  So usually you're like, well, there's no way they're going to create a steal or [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3197.84s)]
*  create any kind of like, you know, defensive pressure out of this. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3200.96s)]
*  But what it does is by the time they, the Knicks set up their offense, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3204.1600000000003s)]
*  instead of having 20 seconds left on the shot clock, they got like eight. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3208.48s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3212.24s)]
*  When you got eight seconds left, the play is rushed. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3213.44s)]
*  Everybody's thinking about that clock ticking. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3216.88s)]
*  And if your first option, that first pick and roll doesn't go as you would hoped, [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3219.36s)]
*  it's not like you have time to reset it. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3224.16s)]
*  So now you're forced to take worse shots and they have the talent that's willing to pick up 94 feet. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3226.24s)]
*  Not every team has the talent that's willing to pick up 94 feet. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3232.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3235.12s)]
*  I mean, Pascal's a crazy defender. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3235.36s)]
*  Well, and then Pascal's been playing out of his mind offensively. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3237.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3239.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't think they're like, like him specifically. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3240.5800000000004s)]
*  Now we're getting into like deep basketball shit, but you can't put someone too small on him [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3243.94s)]
*  because he has this great little like bump to create separation. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3249.6200000000003s)]
*  And then he kind of like fades away and he's at around like 12, 14 feet and he just lights out. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3253.0600000000004s)]
*  So you need someone with length. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3258.02s)]
*  But if that person with length isn't big enough, he'll just bully them. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3259.6200000000003s)]
*  So he's a matchup nightmare. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3263.78s)]
*  Okay. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3265.5400000000004s)]
*  And then the other thing is as far as like getting picked up 94 feet, Brunson is not fast. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3266.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3272.8199999999997s)]
*  His game is really interesting. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3273.22s)]
*  He has an incredible first step. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3274.66s)]
*  So his first step, he gets by you. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3277.2999999999997s)]
*  And then after that, it's all weight. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3280.1s)]
*  So he gets by you by like a couple inches. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3283.38s)]
*  And then what he does is he leans on you now that you're basically, [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3286.58s)]
*  now that you can't put pressure on him to stop him from going to the basket, [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3291.22s)]
*  he leans into you. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3294.82s)]
*  Lean into you, yeah. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3295.94s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3296.5800000000004s)]
*  So now once he is the angle, there's really nothing you can do. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3297.1400000000003s)]
*  If you lean too much on him, he jumps foul. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3300.1000000000004s)]
*  If you don't lean at all, he uses your body and his body creates separation. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3303.1400000000003s)]
*  But he's not blowing by you. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3308.34s)]
*  So when you're getting picked up 94 feet, he'll get by you. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3310.02s)]
*  But then a quick defender will just get back. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3313.06s)]
*  Whereas a speedy Claxton or like, you know, [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3315.7000000000003s)]
*  some of the guys that we grew up watching like really quick, like an AI, for example. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3318.34s)]
*  Once AI gets by you, he's a sprinter. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3322.1000000000004s)]
*  It's like you're done. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3324.82s)]
*  So you don't even bother picking him up 94 feet. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3325.86s)]
*  So there are some like interesting wrinkles. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3328.26s)]
*  And when Brunson, I feel like they got his handle down, [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3330.9s)]
*  where it's like they know when he's going to do this behind the back move. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3333.38s)]
*  Like they've been picking it from him quite a bit. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3335.86s)]
*  He's still scoring 40 again. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3338.82s)]
*  Like he's unstoppable. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3340.02s)]
*  But at what cost? [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3341.2200000000003s)]
*  It's like he's putting a 40, but are the other guys getting involved? [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3342.1800000000003s)]
*  So it's tricky. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3346.9s)]
*  So you think game four, they got it. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3348.7400000000002s)]
*  I think they got it. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3350.02s)]
*  I think being able to, when you're down 0-2 and you go to an away game, [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3350.5s)]
*  and then you win an away game, especially after being down 20, [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3354.5s)]
*  you now all of a sudden get all the confidence that evaporated back. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3359.3s)]
*  I think they get this next game. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3363.3s)]
*  I think they come back. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3364.66s)]
*  And I think it's how confident you feel about that? [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3365.62s)]
*  100%. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3369.86s)]
*  So how much you betting on it? [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3371.06s)]
*  If I was going to use the largest social casino, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3373.94s)]
*  the leader in global betting in the US social casinos. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3378.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3380.1s)]
*  What is that? [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3380.34s)]
*  Steak. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3381.06s)]
*  If I was going to do that, which we still have to talk to them and figure out what the [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3381.86s)]
*  fuck a social casino is. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3385.46s)]
*  But if we were going to use the leader in global betting in the US social casinos, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3388.02s)]
*  to bet on this game, I would bet, I'd put a hefty amount on there, my boy. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3391.94s)]
*  How much? [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3399.6200000000003s)]
*  You just said 100%. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3400.1s)]
*  So I put a hefty amount. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3401.2200000000003s)]
*  But 100% could be life savings. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3402.7400000000002s)]
*  It could be life savings. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3404.58s)]
*  That could be. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3405.2200000000003s)]
*  I got a child, bro. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3406.02s)]
*  So you're not feeling 100% then? [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3407.94s)]
*  I got a child. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3409.38s)]
*  I feel 100%. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3410.26s)]
*  I feel 100% like I got a child. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3411.94s)]
*  If I didn't have a child, it'd be a very different situation. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3414.9s)]
*  But think about how much money you could make for her future if you just put all of it on. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3416.7400000000002s)]
*  If I'm, if I'm you guys, I wouldn't bet your whole house. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3420.1000000000004s)]
*  That's what I wouldn't do. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3423.94s)]
*  But I would feel very confident in putting some money down. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3425.78s)]
*  I put 100. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3430.5800000000004s)]
*  I put $100. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3431.3s)]
*  I put $100. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3431.78s)]
*  It doesn't make it more fun. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3432.5s)]
*  Yeah, I put $100. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3434.42s)]
*  Just make the game interesting. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3435.0600000000004s)]
*  Put a little 100 on it. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3435.46s)]
*  Anyway, use your promo code FLAGRANT for your welcome bonus when you go to stake. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3436.8199999999997s)]
*  We also got to get Tim Shalome on the pod, dude. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3441.9399999999996s)]
*  That's gotta happen. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3443.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, Tim has been killing it. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3444.58s)]
*  Quartzite Timmy, bro. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3445.7s)]
*  I mean, I love it. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3446.66s)]
*  He worked his shit. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3447.62s)]
*  Swagged out, too. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3448.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, the fits are crazy. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3449.7799999999997s)]
*  Whoever's styling Tim, by the way, you're absolutely murdering it. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3450.8199999999997s)]
*  It's not try hard. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3454.02s)]
*  It's like vintage Nick stuff. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3455.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3457.22s)]
*  It looks good. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3457.9399999999996s)]
*  Like you got to slightly try hard. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3458.58s)]
*  But Tim's... [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3460.18s)]
*  But he's Quartzite. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3460.8999999999996s)]
*  He's Quartzite. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3461.8599999999997s)]
*  That's the only thing I was going to say. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3462.3399999999997s)]
*  It's only to Tim's. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3463.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's a little. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3464.1s)]
*  Whoever's doing it is not like from New York. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3464.9s)]
*  It's funny as I have to. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3467.86s)]
*  Yeah, but you're from New York. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3469.3s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3470.34s)]
*  It makes no difference. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3470.82s)]
*  So is Tim. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3471.46s)]
*  But like, you don't got to wear Tim's every... [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3472.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3475.38s)]
*  It's still like what somebody thinks people from New York wear. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3475.94s)]
*  But enough of this stuff is like old and vintage where it's really working and it's fire. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3481.06s)]
*  And he's into it. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3485.46s)]
*  He's a real fan. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3488.02s)]
*  Quartzite in Indiana is crazy. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3488.6600000000003s)]
*  That, you know, that shit is usually illegal. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3490.58s)]
*  What? [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3494.9s)]
*  Quartzite seats usually are just owned by the team. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3496.7400000000002s)]
*  So like anytime you sit Quartzite, the team is basically going here, come sit Quartzite. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3501.38s)]
*  And they don't allow you... [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3506.9s)]
*  Like for example, this is Indiana, right? [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3508.34s)]
*  He's not wearing any Nick's paraphernalia. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3510.7400000000002s)]
*  So what he was... [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3513.14s)]
*  What a few of the Quartzite seats they give to people to like buy. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3514.1800000000003s)]
*  And very few of them. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3519.3s)]
*  So for example, I had some buddies of mine, shout out to Ed and Randy. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3520.74s)]
*  They have Quartzite seats in Boston. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3525.06s)]
*  They invited me up there to go to the games, right? [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3526.5s)]
*  When Nick's were playing Boston. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3530.02s)]
*  And they had Timmy there in those seats as well. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3531.54s)]
*  And the rule was like you cannot wear any Nick's. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3534.5s)]
*  And they had to argue with the franchise because they knew he was like this New York figure. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3536.58s)]
*  And like we can't have a New Yorker in here. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3541.22s)]
*  Like remember when the Nick's were playing the 76ers? [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3544.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3546.5s)]
*  There were so many New Yorkers that went down to Philly for the games. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3547.2999999999997s)]
*  That the owners bought like 3,000 of their own tickets and gave them out to policemen, firemen. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3550.7400000000002s)]
*  So they do protect the aura, if you will. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3558.9s)]
*  So for him to be Quartzite in Indiana is... [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3561.86s)]
*  They put it this way. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3565.94s)]
*  There were a lot of like behind the scenes negotiations for it to even happen. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3566.66s)]
*  And the number one prerequisite was he cannot wear any Nick's attire. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3571.62s)]
*  Is it just optics and brand or do you think it actually affects the game if the whole Quartzite is... [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3575.62s)]
*  I think it's optics and brand. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3580.9s)]
*  I mean it can like affect you a little bit but these guys are so locked in they're not worried about... [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3582.1800000000003s)]
*  That's what I assume. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3585.54s)]
*  This is like ownership being like yeah we want every shot to show our people. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3586.26s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3589.94s)]
*  100%. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3590.82s)]
*  I heard Oklahoma City is actually super tough for opposing fans to get in. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3591.7000000000003s)]
*  Oh because that's all they got. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3595.14s)]
*  I think they said no to Lil Wayne or something when Miami was playing in the finals I think. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3595.7000000000003s)]
*  Well they have the college basketball atmosphere. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3599.14s)]
*  They all show up. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3601.94s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3602.82s)]
*  They wear the shirt. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3603.38s)]
*  It's the only team they got. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3604.1s)]
*  Yeah it's the only thing they got out there and their team like show their fans show up for them. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3605.54s)]
*  What's happening to Ant Edwards bro? [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3610.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't know man. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3613.46s)]
*  I hate seeing SGA like... [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3614.42s)]
*  He's killing them. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3617.14s)]
*  Just crush them. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3618.1s)]
*  I don't know that team I'm not a huge fan of the Oklahoma City Thunder and I love the Wolves. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3620.9s)]
*  I love Ant Edwards. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3624.98s)]
*  I would love to see them win but that last game I think just broke them. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3625.7799999999997s)]
*  Losing by two. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3628.98s)]
*  We're down two one already. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3630.58s)]
*  I think it's just a wrap at home. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3632.02s)]
*  Yeah I think it's a wrap but like I thought this was going to be like the breakout for Ant. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3634.18s)]
*  I thought he becomes the star of the league for the next 10 years from this specific [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3638.98s)]
*  playoff series because you're going against the guy who was just called the MVP and I'm [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3645.06s)]
*  thinking you got a little chip on your shoulder. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3648.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3650.5s)]
*  Oh they gave this Canadian motherfucker the MVP? [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3650.82s)]
*  Yeah I mean game three he busted ass Ant but then I think Oklahoma City... [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3653.06s)]
*  He only had 16 last night. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3656.9s)]
*  Yeah game three he was like two for 16 shoot it like something horrible. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3658.42s)]
*  I feel like he had the chip on his shoulder for the LA series. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3663.3s)]
*  And then after that he's good. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3666.02s)]
*  Now he was putting up Angel Reese numbers man. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3668.02s)]
*  Yo question about this Angel Reese thing. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3671.86s)]
*  Just Angel Caitlin. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3676.5s)]
*  Not I don't want to get into like the RG3 Ryan Clark peep but like [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3677.62s)]
*  is okay here's the question if Angel was white is this even a rivalry? [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3683.62s)]
*  No. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3688.34s)]
*  Not to the level of this. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3691.06s)]
*  I wouldn't say to the level but it still would be because she's if she's white but as outspoken [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3692.74s)]
*  as Angel is it would still be something. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3697.54s)]
*  But if her skills were where they are. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3699.62s)]
*  This is not even a shot at Angel Reese but this is like if let's say they're on different teams [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3702.98s)]
*  it's like a Steph Curry Dramon Green beef. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3706.9s)]
*  It's just like who cares one he's a defender and a rebounder. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3709.94s)]
*  That's phenomenal. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3712.74s)]
*  The other one is a shooter a marksman a point guard like it's not a thing. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3713.06s)]
*  That's a great comparison which is it's not to say that Dramon is a bad player at all phenomenal [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3717.54s)]
*  player. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3723.3s)]
*  Hall of Famer. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3723.54s)]
*  But there are levels to this shit. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3724.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3726.42s)]
*  And the fact that they're even being compared at all is because of popularity one but also [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3726.66s)]
*  this racial dynamic and there's an interesting thing happening here where it's like you know [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3731.06s)]
*  how we oftentimes inflate white or minority players in sports that are not black like [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3736.02s)]
*  Jeremy Lin. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3745.54s)]
*  He was a good player and he played outstanding for that series of games but he's not an elite [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3746.98s)]
*  point guard but the fact that he's the only Asian guy there was excitement around it. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3751.8599999999997s)]
*  And we've done this with white players throughout NBA history. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3756.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3759.46s)]
*  You know like there are certain guys that popped up were like oh my god this guy is so [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3759.7s)]
*  exciting. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3762.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3763.46s)]
*  But it's really just because he's like a white guy in a sport that's dominated by non-whites. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3763.7s)]
*  And this is this other version where it's like she is singular in her talent not single [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3769.14s)]
*  there are other players in the W.A. they're really good. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3775.46s)]
*  And I think they're looking for somebody to like kind of. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3777.8599999999997s)]
*  Kaelin's game is singular in the WNBA. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3780.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3782.42s)]
*  I don't know you can say AJ Wilson is a better player I don't watch enough to know but like [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3782.74s)]
*  we never seen anybody play like Kaelin. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3786.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3787.78s)]
*  And we're all excited about it. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3788.02s)]
*  And I do think people were more excited because she was white like people in the Midwest love [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3789.38s)]
*  the fact that this is this white girl bussing ass. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3792.82s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3794.5s)]
*  Sure. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3794.98s)]
*  But then we to your point I think to finish it out then we see Angel Reese and we're like [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3795.3s)]
*  well let's inflate her game because all the other dynamics are there for a great sports [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3799.38s)]
*  rivalry. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3803.3s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3803.78s)]
*  And I think Angel is like incredible at creating media attention. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3804.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3808.18s)]
*  She's very charismatic. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3808.5s)]
*  Whether she realizes or not like she is a magnet. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3809.54s)]
*  Like I think she has far [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3813.86s)]
*  more gravity outside of basketball. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3815.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3818.1s)]
*  Than Kaelin does. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3818.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3819.38s)]
*  Oh for sure. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3819.78s)]
*  Like I haven't seen Kaelin like go viral for an interview or anything that her play is what [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3820.7400000000002s)]
*  goes viral. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3824.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3824.7400000000002s)]
*  Like anything Angel does is viral. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3824.98s)]
*  Like she looks good she has a podcast that does good numbers like yeah she's good. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3827.94s)]
*  She's good at talking shit. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3831.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3832.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3833.06s)]
*  I see her go viral like that that's great. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3833.38s)]
*  Sneakers are selling like crazy right now. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3835.3s)]
*  So she is like a she's a cultural figure. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3837.3s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3839.94s)]
*  You know I'm trying to. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3840.7400000000002s)]
*  They kind of need each other in a way like it's like not exactly I'm trying to think of [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3841.54s)]
*  boxing rivalries where like someone is like underpowered like almost like McGregor. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3846.02s)]
*  McGregor Pacquia or McGregor Floyd. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3851.78s)]
*  Mayweather. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3853.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3854.42s)]
*  Where like McGregor kind of carried the promotion but Floyd is like the star. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3854.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3859.7000000000003s)]
*  And they kind of need each other a little bit. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3860.1800000000003s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3862.1s)]
*  You're saying Kaelin is like McGregor. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3862.42s)]
*  No Angel is like McGregor where she's like she's not as talented but she's able to create so [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3864.5s)]
*  much media circus that it makes everyone more money. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3869.3s)]
*  She's absolutely a star. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3871.78s)]
*  And then also it's a legacy beef right. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3872.42s)]
*  It's a legacy rival where they carried over from college. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3874.02s)]
*  Yeah the college thing I mean even the shit talk just going up to her with that. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3876.1s)]
*  I mean that was great. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3879.22s)]
*  Fantastic content. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3880.2599999999998s)]
*  So I don't know if they ever have conversations you know outside of the court but it would if [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3881.46s)]
*  I was managing both of them I'd be like guys just keep doing exactly what you're doing. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3888.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3893.22s)]
*  I think I think that combo has happened. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3893.62s)]
*  Good more shit talk. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3895.86s)]
*  We need a guy in the mix. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3896.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3897.94s)]
*  We need like a we need a tryst we need a lover's tryst. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3898.2599999999998s)]
*  Oh if if if Angel fucks Kaelin's man. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3900.66s)]
*  If Angel fucks Kaelin's man. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3904.26s)]
*  I'm just saying. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3906.6600000000003s)]
*  They don't do this with NBA you know you don't got to bring girls. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3906.82s)]
*  Because they're good but I'm saying yeah. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3909.38s)]
*  I hated that. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3912.02s)]
*  That was the worst. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3912.82s)]
*  Take that shit too easy dog we ain't listening to anybody. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3914.5s)]
*  Ain't nobody listen to that horrible decision you can make. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3917.54s)]
*  You know what's funny is that like. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3920.82s)]
*  They're already having them do the fucking walk in dressed in barely anything like that's enough. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3922.7400000000002s)]
*  I know. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3927.7000000000003s)]
*  They dress themselves bro and they do that with the men on top of that. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3928.02s)]
*  They don't. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3931.38s)]
*  They do that with the dudes. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3932.18s)]
*  But you see the they are focusing when wearing them high heels man. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3933.2999999999997s)]
*  It's like white people dancing it's like. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3941.54s)]
*  One one two three. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3943.06s)]
*  It feels like when you get pulled over for drunk driving. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3945.2999999999997s)]
*  You're like just walk straight left foot right foot left. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3951.62s)]
*  I want one game where their wives dress them. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3954.18s)]
*  I think that'd be fire. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3956.1s)]
*  Their their lesbian wives dress them up. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3956.98s)]
*  Now yeah where the where the cargo cutoffs and then the flannel. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3958.98s)]
*  I do dress very lesbian. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3966.18s)]
*  She's beautiful. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3968.34s)]
*  Yeah come on now. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3969.22s)]
*  She's beautiful and great for the league. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3970.18s)]
*  She knows how to walk. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3972.26s)]
*  I mean how grateful is league that all these beautiful girls can hoop now. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3973.7s)]
*  I mean this is. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3976.42s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3977.14s)]
*  It's literally this it is the difference maker and it sucks for women. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3977.86s)]
*  But there is much more interest from women even when the women are beautiful. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3981.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3986.58s)]
*  I don't know what that says about women because we're the ones that I guess are always objectifying [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3987.06s)]
*  them. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3992.58s)]
*  But there is a level of objectification from women towards other women. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3993.14s)]
*  Yeah absolutely. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3996.98s)]
*  They're far more interested in them when they are beautiful and stylish. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=3997.38s)]
*  Women love pretty women. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4000.5s)]
*  And the second we got this like influx of pretty women in the WNBA and some singular talent. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4002.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4008.7400000000002s)]
*  Now every there are guys. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4010.1s)]
*  Yelly Ryan Clark and RG3. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4013.38s)]
*  Are having like a spat on the internet about female sports. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4016.1s)]
*  Did you ever imagine that it would be the talk of a sports news media. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4021.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4027.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4028.42s)]
*  Yeah it's crazy. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4029.22s)]
*  I mean great for the league. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4030.18s)]
*  It's like genuinely really cool. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4031.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah I just wish RG3 or Ryan Clark picked a different reason to hate RG3. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4033.3799999999997s)]
*  Because there's so many better reasons. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4036.58s)]
*  We really jumped out of the window. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4038.3399999999997s)]
*  Son that's keep going on that because there's so many. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4039.3799999999997s)]
*  Nobody seems to like RG3. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4043.14s)]
*  His ex teammates don't really say nice things about him. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4044.82s)]
*  Owners that work with him didn't say nice things about him. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4047.2200000000003s)]
*  He blames all these his coaches for playing him when he was injured. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4049.54s)]
*  He insisted on playing. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4052.5s)]
*  He never studied film. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4053.6200000000003s)]
*  That's why he never got better as a quarterback. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4054.5800000000004s)]
*  And everything I always felt was very performative with him and very like. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4056.5800000000004s)]
*  And dude I talked to people who went to Baylor with him while he was there. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4060.9s)]
*  And this is before he became like a star star. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4064.98s)]
*  But he just started he just won the Heisman. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4067.2200000000003s)]
*  I was like what's he like and they were like no not the nicest guy. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4068.7400000000002s)]
*  Like he puts it on for the camera. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4071.54s)]
*  Multiple people said that. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4073.1400000000003s)]
*  And then I see these little things where like his wife is expecting a baby. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4074.34s)]
*  And he's on the air on a halftime show. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4078.1000000000004s)]
*  And he's like I have to leave my wife is delivering a baby. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4079.86s)]
*  And then he sprints off camera. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4082.5s)]
*  And it's like you didn't find that out during the commercial break. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4083.7000000000003s)]
*  You came back from commercial and then sprinted off on it. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4085.78s)]
*  So many valid reasons to be like this guy sucks. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4088.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4090.7400000000002s)]
*  And then you chose the one that is you got a white wife. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4091.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4094.1000000000004s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4094.6600000000003s)]
*  Especially when Ryan got a white kid. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4096.1s)]
*  Yeah dude what are you doing? [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4098.34s)]
*  Really? [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4100.5s)]
*  Half white kid. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4101.22s)]
*  He got half white kid. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4102.66s)]
*  But he had a kid with a white girl. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4104.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4105.22s)]
*  I didn't know this when we were going through. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4105.860000000001s)]
*  I was like shit. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4107.3s)]
*  Shout out Ryan. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4111.38s)]
*  Ryan's going through it. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4112.26s)]
*  I think he came back and apologized for bringing up the wife which is smart. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4113.22s)]
*  That's something I think we don't really do on this show Elise. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4118.58s)]
*  It's like if your wife isn't in the public eye or has nothing to do with entertainment. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4121.38s)]
*  His thought process was he said something to try to shield himself which was I met her. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4125.9400000000005s)]
*  I think she's much more than a white woman. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4130.58s)]
*  I think you present her as just a white woman. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4132.42s)]
*  And his thought process was since she's in the background of RG3's videos a lot [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4134.34s)]
*  I can bring that up but it's just never going to look good. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4138.82s)]
*  Okay if she is a public figure. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4141.46s)]
*  RG3 puts her in the videos. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4145.22s)]
*  She doesn't have her own thing. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4146.58s)]
*  But it's like if you're going to do that it's going to be received. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4147.78s)]
*  Like why are you bringing the wife into it? [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4150.34s)]
*  And the wife just because she's white blah blah blah. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4151.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah we don't disrespect wives we only disrespect bitches. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4153.860000000001s)]
*  The girlfriends they bitches. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4158.42s)]
*  But the wives. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4160.5s)]
*  Damn man. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4161.14s)]
*  The way you say it even is just kind of I don't know. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4162.5s)]
*  I've understood the thought process completely. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4165.14s)]
*  There you go. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4166.82s)]
*  I'm aligned. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4167.38s)]
*  I'm aligned. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4168.58s)]
*  Real recognize real. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4169.14s)]
*  It is annoying that the raise of your spouse only comes up if you disagree. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4170.58s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4173.62s)]
*  Yeah talk about that. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4174.900000000001s)]
*  It just seems like such a. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4177.38s)]
*  To you. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4178.26s)]
*  I've been thinking about that shit all my time dude. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4179.78s)]
*  I don't even want you agreeing with me. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4184.02s)]
*  You got a white wife. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4185.54s)]
*  That's consistent. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4186.58s)]
*  That's consistent. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4187.54s)]
*  That's a way better position to have. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4188.26s)]
*  You're going to be a fan of mine yo. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4189.78s)]
*  That's a way better position to have. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4191.22s)]
*  But just someone the second they don't say what you think. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4192.9800000000005s)]
*  And then it's like oh well now your relationship is invalid. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4195.780000000001s)]
*  When you agree with me it's like all right you're black and red now. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4198.820000000001s)]
*  But the second you disagree then it's like oh you're actually not black. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4201.7s)]
*  We do start to invalidate according to Dr. Kumar. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4203.780000000001s)]
*  No that is a great point. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4209.3s)]
*  We do seek to invalidate the people that disagree with us [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4210.58s)]
*  instead of addressing the points that they're making offensively. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4214.66s)]
*  And that is what they did to Ryan Clark with the half white daughter. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4218.02s)]
*  Yeah exactly it's like him having a half white daughter should have nothing to do with this. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4220.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4223.9400000000005s)]
*  Right but address the opinions you both have. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4224.58s)]
*  But if you bring in somebody's wife as part of your opinion. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4226.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah yeah yeah. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4229.700000000001s)]
*  Now you're opening that can of worms. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4230.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4233.14s)]

*  company I go why they go well because the SEC could file against you and the FTC could file [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4494.26s)]

*  it's been disclosed so you can keep on listening to the rest of the pod if you want or not that's [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4525.62s)]
*  totally fine sounds like a great job you guys you're welcome and addictive is addictive is a [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4528.900000000001s)]

*  call Morgan okay let's talk about Timmy on in this CNN interview that went crazy god bless dude Timmy [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4549.86s)]
*  yeah he was cooking oh did you guys watch the interview yeah he's fantastic he's great he's [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4558.66s)]
*  great he's he I thought he handled it really well these are my least favorite type of interviews [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4563.46s)]
*  yeah where there's a lack of curiosity I don't like this style of interviewing which which comes [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4567.86s)]
*  off as again I can't say like what this person's goal was but like which comes the these style of [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4574.9s)]
*  interviews that I think were popularized they've been along around for a while don't get me wrong [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4581.0599999999995s)]
*  but where it's like this is how I feel about the world and I'm going to ask you questions [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4585.54s)]
*  that will confirm my belief about the world instead of this is how I feel about the world [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4593.06s)]
*  am I off for thinking about this I'm around somebody who like has in-depth knowledge about [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4601.14s)]
*  this stuff tell me if maybe I'm wrong and maybe tell me if I should change my opinion on it so [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4607.54s)]
*  it's a lack of curiosity and I think that one of the great things about Joe and one of the great [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4613.38s)]
*  things about podcasting in general is when you kind of decentralized media is you can be curious [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4618.66s)]
*  you can ask you can find shit out oh this person thinks the pyramids were built by aliens oh tell [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4625.54s)]
*  me why you think that this person doesn't think it he just had the other guy on the guy from Egypt [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4629.7s)]
*  who was it tell me why it isn't the case right and it's like and I didn't watch that whole interview [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4635.14s)]
*  maybe there's ways that he's gonna push back but this idea of true curiosity and I think that's why [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4639.94s)]
*  people tend to move away from traditional media because it didn't feel curious it felt this is my [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4645.299999999999s)]
*  opinion on this topic which just so happens to mirror the opinion of the viewers of the network [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4651.94s)]
*  and I'm going to bring you on here to either get you to agree with me or humiliate you for not [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4659.219999999999s)]
*  agreeing with me and Tim is so savvy he found a way to jujitsu his way out of it and kind of expose [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4664.82s)]
*  the interviewer but it's I think this is one of the things that like people [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4670.98s)]
*  as a whole have been rejecting from traditional media is a lack of genuine curiosity and a [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4678.0199999999995s)]
*  it's almost like the interviewer is telling you what you are [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4686.099999999999s)]
*  I want to give a little push back I think there's the place for both of the styles of interviews [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4688.58s)]
*  yeah like I like the way Rogan does because his is like he's curious but like if you go with a [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4696.82s)]
*  journalist who's done their research if it feels genuine as long as they're not just like trying [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4702.26s)]
*  to have a moment like if that's what her views are and maybe most of the people who watch this [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4707.14s)]
*  channel they share similar views I think it's actually good to have the interview from that [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4713.22s)]
*  point of view and then have the person there who can rebut it it means more like I watched that [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4718.02s)]
*  interview I was like oh wow this is good because this girl went in a little bit narrow-minded and [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4723.46s)]
*  Tim was able to like that's a great point debunk all those I completely agree I completely agree [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4727.46s)]
*  with what you're what you're saying in my point it's like if you already feel the way about the [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4732.18s)]
*  world and you don't want to change that feeling then why are you asking somebody to come on your [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4736.1s)]
*  show if that person was asking to come on your show so they can shine light on this topic that [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4740.9800000000005s)]
*  you may feel differently about that's a different thing but if you're requesting an interview with [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4747.0599999999995s)]
*  somebody just to prove how you already feel about something the lack of curiosity I think creates [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4751.379999999999s)]
*  this like animosity too strong a word but almost like for the audience like I almost kind of want [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4757.86s)]
*  to reject it like her first question I thought was really disrespectful the the opening question was [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4763.139999999999s)]
*  um so you just had a comedy special come out do you want to talk about it yeah I think on the [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4769.62s)]
*  press run for the comedy special that I just released I would like to talk about it that's [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4776.42s)]
*  why I'm here and then it's like she was okay give me the short for it give me the short of [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4780.34s)]
*  what your specialist yeah did you not watch the special like like to me it's like a disrespect [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4784.34s)]
*  like let's get this out the way so I can get to what do the bare minimum research of who that [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4791.62s)]
*  person is and why you want to talk I definitely understand and I I would have taken it that way [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4795.78s)]
*  I thought what made Tim so effective is he didn't take anything that way personally and he did a [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4799.9400000000005s)]
*  great job to Alex's point that does give you the opportunity if you are an adept speaker especially [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4805.38s)]
*  in that kind of environment a person who would wants to side with her might be like this guy's [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4810.900000000001s)]
*  actually making a lot of really good fun and I think that's ran circles around I think what to [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4816.900000000001s)]
*  Al's point it's like it's it's great for the viewers not necessarily maybe her viewers that [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4820.34s)]
*  want to see her opinion which is also their opinion confirmed which I think is like an issue [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4829.78s)]
*  with legacy media it's an issue with like journalism a lot of way in terms of like print [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4834.98s)]
*  journalism it's just like this is the perspective from this magazine and we are just going to [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4838.5s)]
*  project that perspective on every different story that we tell and there's something boring about [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4842.339999999999s)]
*  that it's like it's expected like and that's kind of what I didn't like about it but seeing [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4846.5s)]
*  somebody that's as adept as Tim and like navigating that type of journalism like he's experienced a [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4853.54s)]
*  lot of it he's probably watched a lot of it he also knows comedy way better than she knows comedy [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4861.14s)]
*  that's not her field of expertise he was able to expose her tactics and I think what ended up going [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4865.46s)]
*  viral was the exposing yeah of her tactics yeah you know her coming in with this idea that there's [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4870.9800000000005s)]
*  like no liberal comedian it's like yeah they are all liberal yeah like every single one of them [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4876.900000000001s)]
*  is like the majority the vast majority yeah yeah were they planning on putting the entire interview [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4883.62s)]
*  out in its entirety I don't know no apparently she asked for that she wanted that which is a [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4890.18s)]
*  testament to her good for her too I thought I think he forced their hand yeah I thought they [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4895.22s)]
*  were going to put out an edited version and Tim was upset he went on Rogan and he was like put [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4899.54s)]
*  the whole thing I think he forced their hand and then if they didn't they look fraudulent okay [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4904.18s)]
*  because it could be very easy to edit it chop it up my understanding was she asked for it so maybe [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4908.66s)]
*  I got there wrong but I also the best moment in this clip that went viral is when uh I don't know [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4912.66s)]
*  if we want to play it or not but when he names the leftist center comedians and then he goes [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4916.82s)]
*  Louis CK and she goes and he goes why because he's an imperfect person yeah and that is like oh that [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4920.58s)]
*  is the entire liberal problem he's a weird freak but he's liberal exactly that's a thousand percent [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4926.42s)]
*  and that's okay and we're not gonna punish him for the rest of his life because he's into some weird [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4932.82s)]
*  freak shit yeah but do you want that vote or not or you can't vote for me and well that's why I [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4937.0599999999995s)]
*  exactly if nobody's yeah this is a greater discussion we could even get into like a response [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4941.62s)]
*  from some of our recent interviews you know Bernie and Pete but like but yeah I'm curious [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4948.02s)]
*  your guys take on that Tim and I thought her tactic I'm like it the steel man and like in good [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4952.74s)]
*  faith she kind of was just sort of like asking probing questions had her own agenda but I also [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4959.7s)]
*  wonder if there's like a style where she comes in so underspoken like so soft kind of like leading [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4964.42s)]
*  questions but not really like staking her position trying to get him to say something [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4970.1s)]
*  kind of inflammatory or like a sound bite yeah and because it wasn't supposed to go out in its [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4975.06s)]
*  entirety I feel like that was kind of the strategy is like and then you can edit whoever you want [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4978.900000000001s)]
*  like do you think that there's a you know right-wing comedians and then do you think there's a lot of [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4983.46s)]
*  right-wing comedians in Texas and like slowly kind of getting it deeper and deeper like nudging you [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4987.700000000001s)]
*  in a direction that she wants you to be already yeah which is I feel like an unfair way of having [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4992.26s)]
*  an open conversation with somebody but no disrespect is that anything different than what [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=4997.3s)]
*  club shea shea does in that of what I would do is call club shea shea gotcha show oh but that's [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5001.22s)]
*  what I've said it here I think it's a little different because it seems like Shannon will [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5008.34s)]
*  just be like so here's a huge controversy you're in what do you think about it and he'll just sort [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5011.14s)]
*  of just put it out and then you can deal with it anyway she didn't really don't even know the fuck [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5014.900000000001s)]
*  you even know what's going on so it's just like you got caught up in this shit what's your response [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5018.74s)]
*  the fact that you play football for as long as he did in conform full sentences with the brain [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5022.5s)]
*  yeah yeah it's a fucking miracle yeah but with this lady it seems like there was a lot of stuff [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5026.82s)]
*  she didn't know like she was making assumptions and then tim was like no what are you talking [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5030.5s)]
*  about which is which is which is the goes to the point that I'm making which is like you're coming [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5034.5s)]
*  with assumptions when if there was genuine curiosity and like a good faith conversation [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5038.0199999999995s)]
*  you would just come in not knowing and asking those questions you know like I noticed a moment [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5042.179999999999s)]
*  where she was like I've been researching stand-up comedy right away I'm like all right well then [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5047.78s)]
*  you don't you don't research you don't know you don't you didn't know it coming in what did you [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5051.219999999999s)]
*  research and then when I heard the question she was asking I was like I don't think you really [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5055.3s)]
*  didn't do your research I think you talk to a few comedians that you know or people who dabbled in [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5058.66s)]
*  comedy and these guys don't know dude there's a you know if you ask people who stand-up comics are [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5062.820000000001s)]
*  they don't often know the people that we think they would know also there was a point where I [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5068.9800000000005s)]
*  think she was basically trying to get at which like is the is the mothership a right-wing comedy [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5073.78s)]
*  club or something like that that's what she wanted tim to say she wanted or she wanted to get that out [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5079.14s)]
*  of him to say like there's a sort of a republican agenda within the podcast establishment at these [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5083.14s)]
*  comedy clubs that pushes this type of rhetoric yeah and it's just not the case now here's the [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5088.02s)]
*  thing that is true without a doubt is that things trend and comedians gravitate less just like any [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5092.34s)]
*  other person in life towards their salvation right so like uh crowd work becomes popular all these [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5098.42s)]
*  comedians just start doing crowd work right youtube specials become popular all these [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5106.740000000001s)]
*  community do you posting clips to compile every but does it there was a time right now where like [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5111.86s)]
*  some of the comedians that are seen now is like edgy and dark we're doing pg material trying to [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5116.339999999999s)]
*  get on comedy central so now they're kind of edgy dark because that's maybe a lot maybe that was [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5124.259999999999s)]
*  always who they were and they just couldn't find success in that because comedy central had a [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5129.62s)]
*  stranglehold on like what comedy was but comedians do gravitate towards what they believe will be [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5133.94s)]
*  successful there is no top-down influence in the mothership like joe going you have to do jokes [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5139.54s)]
*  about this but there are surely young comedians that think oh maybe the way i get on is if i say [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5146.02s)]
*  these things that i hear the popular people in this scene doing but there's never any but like [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5153.14s)]
*  joe likes weirdos joe likes misfits he likes it if you knew joe's friend group outside of comedy [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5159.38s)]
*  they're like the most peculiar like pool sharks and just random people you bump into he just likes [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5165.22s)]
*  so there's no pressure ever but i think that's kind of like what she wanted him to say but to [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5171.3s)]
*  say that there aren't like trends in certain things like the alt scene in new york had a [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5176.26s)]
*  specific style of comedy that everybody adopted like early when i was coming up in comedy and [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5180.740000000001s)]
*  you know david tell who's always been like the fixture at the like at the comedy cellar [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5186.820000000001s)]
*  uh every comedian was doing a david tell impression and they'll admit this themselves [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5193.46s)]
*  like they all their act out sounded like a tell their voices sounded like a tell their rhythm [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5197.7s)]
*  sounded like a tell he was so influential that it just kind of trickled down so there's no question [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5201.54s)]
*  whether that that influence exists but is there a is there like an active push to make people do [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5205.78s)]
*  that absolutely not it's more like how do i succeed within this system and to give her a little grace [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5212.82s)]
*  maybe she just heard like what you said and now it's like oh i'm assuming that people are being [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5218.5s)]
*  told to this is the comedy exactly form here because i hear that a lot of comics will perform [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5224.5s)]
*  here here's a bitter comic who isn't past at the mothership that says something like oh you gotta [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5229.46s)]
*  be fucking right wing to get up there and it's just like no you just didn't get past and you're [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5233.62s)]
*  trying to find a way to justify you not getting past outside of you not being funny but you aren't [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5237.3s)]
*  funny yeah and there's a lot of people who aren't funny that don't want to just go maybe i need to [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5241.62s)]
*  get better yeah okay because there's nobody there's no liberal community is not allowed at [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5245.62s)]
*  the mothership at all like it doesn't even exist they're unfunny people that aren't allowed there [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5250.099999999999s)]
*  absolutely they're unfunny conservatives and unfunny i think she's a political i don't know [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5255.7s)]
*  if she's i don't know this my feel from the interview is she's like a politically minded person [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5259.86s)]
*  who heard that there is a right wing podcast faction and that's why trump got elected and we [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5264.58s)]
*  need to go see what's going on with that let's talk about the optically it looks it looked like [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5270.98s)]
*  that during the election which is so she's looking at all these republicans going on podcasts i mean [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5274.9s)]
*  like well obviously there's an agenda and let's talk about this because i find this very interesting [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5279.219999999999s)]
*  i'm not saying this is since our interviews with pete or or bernie but obviously we had these [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5284.5s)]
*  interviews with pete and bernie that were incredibly viral and um and then you've seen a lot more [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5289.379999999999s)]
*  figures in left-wing media be incredibly outspoken about criticism of the administration not trump [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5296.0199999999995s)]
*  but of the last administration the biden administration and democrats in general [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5305.94s)]
*  and the criticisms that they're echoing are not dissimilar to the criticisms that maybe us and [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5312.1s)]
*  other people in the podcast space have been saying for maybe the last four years [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5321.54s)]
*  okay almost identical talking points i was talking about biden being old and inept [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5327.14s)]
*  and maybe unfit was seemed as a extreme right wing talking point yeah now it is commonplace jake [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5333.94s)]
*  tapper wrote a whole book about it right the same now and again we shouldn't be bitter you gotta let [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5340.26s)]
*  people get to places but the same people that have tried to position us as some extreme right [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5346.18s)]
*  wing and some of our colleagues as some extreme wiping the same people who have tried to position [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5352.900000000001s)]
*  us in that way and spoke about this in that way are now echoing the exact talking points that we [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5357.46s)]
*  have made for four years does that make them extreme right wing now yeah are they extreme right wing [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5363.22s)]
*  people like or were we seeing something that they just missed i refuse to see or or refuse to see [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5370.820000000001s)]
*  because of top-down influence i don't know what it what exactly it is but i think it's an interesting [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5378.900000000001s)]
*  conversation to have you see i think left wing media started to wake up a little bit yeah the [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5383.540000000001s)]
*  jake tapper thing bothers me because it's so disingenuous we've learned this since the election [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5388.34s)]
*  really so on november 5th 6th you learned all this and then had time to write a book by may [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5393.14s)]
*  like a full fucking book then went through edits and god knows what else you had no idea at cnn [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5398.18s)]
*  that joe biden was incompetent and senile and now you're finding it's just like such a load of [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5402.98s)]
*  horseshit and then to position us as this i know two of us didn't vote for trump at least so we're [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5408.74s)]
*  not these guys that you want to make us and it's it is annoying i think more so when you're a minority [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5414.58s)]
*  when it's like don't make me that yeah i'm not your little mascot for right wing anything fuck you [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5418.58s)]
*  or left wing anything but right wing especially you're not going to make me look like some sell [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5423.14s)]
*  out because you want to lie about your president's mental health and i don't yeah i think that now [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5426.34s)]
*  they're i think when you're in a position of power which they thought that they were and it's easy to [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5431.9400000000005s)]
*  like be wrapped up in your little echo chamber chamber you don't have to consider what people [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5436.34s)]
*  are feeling as much or at least you think you know and then when you lose an election there is [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5442.1s)]
*  self-reflection for the smart people it's very easy a lot of people have lost the election it's [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5447.06s)]
*  no different than like not getting passed at a comedy club right where it's just like it's all [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5452.18s)]
*  their fault it's nothing to do with me and i think that you're seeing a lot of people in left-wing [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5455.78s)]
*  media and in smart people in left-wing media they're starting to go hey there are things [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5460.099999999999s)]
*  that we can change you know like ezra klein wrote that big that book i think garrick thompson wrote [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5464.82s)]
*  this book abundance and it's like criticisms of left-wing policies and how potentially it got us [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5470.259999999999s)]
*  here and they were rebuked by a lot of left-wing sources and it's like no no they're trying to call [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5475.86s)]
*  out the things that they believe will help their party yeah and even that criticism there's like [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5480.74s)]
*  this rejection yeah but you're starting to see it i don't know you start i don't want to say like [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5487.0599999999995s)]
*  weaken but you're starting to see people soften to this idea and what's very interesting is i [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5492.74s)]
*  don't think at any point in time they're going to go you know what maybe we shouldn't have painted [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5496.9s)]
*  all those other people yeah as this extreme line of thinking now that we have the exact same thoughts [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5500.74s)]
*  yeah there's no apology there's no accountability there's no nothing so they have to deal like jake [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5506.82s)]
*  tapper should deal with the criticism he's getting yeah but people within these political [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5511.0599999999995s)]
*  establishments will move slower in general than cultural critics yes of course like comedians and [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5515.46s)]
*  a lot of like people in media and podcasters in general like respond to culture and they're able [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5519.86s)]
*  to do it quickly and have less to lose well it just felt like culture the cultural critics are [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5523.62s)]
*  saying the same thing about us yeah uh i see that's where i think i'm a little annoyed and and i [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5527.86s)]
*  think you have every right to be annoyed but like the advantage i think the or the competitive [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5531.86s)]
*  advantage in terms of like understanding people that we might have is that we literally travel [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5535.94s)]
*  the country every single weekend we go to liberal cities conservative cities neutral cities yeah we [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5539.7s)]
*  go every single weekend and we perform for these people we talk to these people so we start to get [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5547.219999999999s)]
*  a good understanding of what people are frustrated by that's different than like sitting in your [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5551.139999999999s)]
*  upper east side office surrounded by a bunch of ivy league kids who are just telling you that [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5556.0199999999995s)]
*  you're right yeah you know and then calling up some consulting firm who's just going to [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5560.82s)]
*  be staffed by the exact ivy league kids that aren't working for you yeah it's you're just [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5565.46s)]
*  talking to the same groups of people so you're not actually talking to quote-unquote real Americans [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5569.94s)]
*  they're americans too of course but you're not talking to a diverse group and now that you're [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5574.98s)]
*  on board it's interesting to see what happens i actually think this is healthy i think this is [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5579.139999999999s)]
*  healthy because i think it like helps the party get a real understanding of who they potentially [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5583.219999999999s)]
*  lost and is it that you don't have a podcast or is it that you're not talking to people [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5587.22s)]
*  outside of your echo chamber and when you are talking to people outside your echo chamber it's [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5592.26s)]
*  usually some gotcha shit like this interview with tim it's like you exit your echo chamber and the [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5596.820000000001s)]
*  goal is to prove that that person is part of this like new mainstream media where everybody's trying [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5602.02s)]
*  to help each other and manipulate you know the country and its voters to go in a certain [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5607.22s)]
*  direction no it's not that and also hollywood has been incredibly left of center for decades [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5611.46s)]
*  how is that not more powerful than six guys with podcasts yeah you know what i mean it's just easier [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5618.58s)]
*  to point the finger yeah you don't want to think that you did anything wrong it's easier for [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5624.26s)]
*  California to be like oh but look at the podcast that's what's causing us oh maybe there's some [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5627.38s)]
*  policies there yeah maybe you got some zoning laws that are making it very difficult to build [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5631.54s)]
*  housing and because of that you have this massive housing shortage maybe it's on you maybe it's on [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5635.14s)]
*  you and those zoning laws and maybe that bureaucracy is making it difficult to build [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5639.86s)]
*  whereas in other places it's not as difficult to build and therefore there's more housing [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5644.58s)]
*  and you can take that on the chin you can go hey we should change this because our people need us [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5648.42s)]
*  to do it so they can live better lives instead of going podcasters or bros into the hemisphere [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5653.46s)]
*  and their sexism bigots it's like the oldest playbook in the world what makes me a little [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5659.0599999999995s)]
*  discouraged is my understanding is a lot of like the democratic political consultants now are like [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5662.66s)]
*  well let's get a liberal podcast and it's like you guys really don't understand what happens [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5667.06s)]
*  tens of millions of dollars you had one it was called the joe rogan expense yeah and yeah and [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5671.06s)]
*  then you threw them out and exactly to what you were saying earlier we're not most of us i don't [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5674.900000000001s)]
*  think are very few of us are a party we are just reflective of what people are feeling because we [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5679.620000000001s)]
*  travel the country especially comedians like you said so that's just figure out what people are [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5685.38s)]
*  feeling and deal with that and then we will we'll be happy we got everybody i travel and talk to is [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5689.780000000001s)]
*  happy as fuck these guys are doing great like instead of changing the policies they're like [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5696.02s)]
*  well let's just throw money instead of throwing it at poor people who could use it let's throw [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5700.740000000001s)]
*  it at podcaster yeah what are you doing you guys don't get it yeah i mean it's it's really funny [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5704.660000000001s)]
*  it's like the biggest interview of pete's career is when he came on the pod bernie's interview was [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5711.38s)]
*  incredibly successful you know um do you need a liberal joe rogan or do you just need to come [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5719.46s)]
*  on podcasts yeah that you avoided that's a great fucking you were asked to come on great fucking [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5727.3s)]
*  point it's not about having a liberal conservative it's about coming on places that are curious [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5732.900000000001s)]
*  they're not trying to like pit you as a specific thing or getcha or edit an interview to make you [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5739.22s)]
*  look bad so that the people that are consuming that network's content feel good about their [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5745.94s)]
*  political opinions like an honest conversation is what people are good faith conversations what [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5750.82s)]
*  people are going to enjoy and that happened yeah and like i literally saw the media from the pete [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5755.78s)]
*  interview it was like pete goes on right wing pod and has great conversation and totally convinces [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5761.46s)]
*  them stuff and then after the burning one happened you started to see like the conversation go from [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5767.46s)]
*  extreme right to just like bernie has fantastic conversation on flagrant podcast like even the [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5773.86s)]
*  way we're seen it's like well yeah maybe if you continue to do that now if kamala came on [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5779.7s)]
*  people would know she sucks because she sucks but that's on her but that's on her she's just [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5785.3s)]
*  a very unpopular candidate i just wish they didn't lie we asked so many times to let her expel [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5790.18s)]
*  the fact that she sucks they all lie or doesn't i think we could have a great interview with her i [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5794.74s)]
*  think one of our strengths is just getting people to have fun and i think we could if we could have [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5798.9s)]
*  gotten her to have fun it would have been fantastic so funny there's a guy who wrote an article [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5802.9s)]
*  that uh we're featured in and he'll remain nameless but like after the pete interview and [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5807.54s)]
*  in the article you know you know we always say this is the greatest hang on the universe yeah i [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5814.259999999999s)]
*  say it was because i think we get like the best side of people out it's not this rigid interview [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5817.299999999999s)]
*  like we're having fun but we're still getting to learn stuff yeah and uh he was like he was like [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5821.0599999999995s)]
*  that's the best interview i've seen pete do oh my oh thanks man and even though he kind of wrote an [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5824.9s)]
*  article shitting on us right yeah and uh not kind then uh bernie comes out he goes dude that's the [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5829.06s)]
*  best bernie article ever saying i'm like are you not even able to realize that like we told you [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5834.5s)]
*  it's the best hang you just saw two yeah it's like yeah in the article he literally is like i [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5840.740000000001s)]
*  disagree that it's yeah i don't know if it's the best i can think of many places that would be [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5847.9400000000005s)]
*  better you gotta retract that interview but that's a correction to that yeah but isn't that interesting [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5852.02s)]
*  it's like you get to put something out there and then like you don't ever have to address it with [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5858.1s)]
*  consequences narratives go fly and it is what it is yeah i'm looking forward to the next election [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5861.06s)]
*  cycle i'm optimistic because we already see that they are going talking everywhere now or they're [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5865.860000000001s)]
*  starting to so it's like and i think we can weed out some of the shitty people that are getting [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5871.14s)]
*  propped up that's what i'm saying like there won't be another kamala if we have a fucking primary [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5874.820000000001s)]
*  and we get to talk to these guys for three hours not just us but whoever yeah talk to these guys [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5879.46s)]
*  for three hours get to know them a little bit and be like oh i like him or i don't at the very least [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5883.620000000001s)]
*  you'll say i like the president we have yeah i like him or her if you're a politician if you [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5887.62s)]
*  don't go speak everywhere i don't trust you you guys you got something to hide what exactly [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5892.42s)]
*  exactly that's a great point i think that you know americans are definitely opening up to that [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5898.5s)]
*  yeah and in addition to being willing to go on platforms having good enough ideas that you're [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5902.66s)]
*  able to package them for the audience you know i mean i think that was part of the the democrats [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5907.3s)]
*  concern is like oh do we have strong enough ideas that we can defend no matter where we are and even [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5911.46s)]
*  if you're in a place you know like this show that's not particularly hostile like oh do you [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5917.06s)]
*  think biden's in good mental condition they're just like we have no answer and so they have to [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5921.46s)]
*  lie or they have to admit and then you know political suicide so you have to also have good [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5926.18s)]
*  enough ideas you can defend regardless and the only way that you get your defense up is by [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5930.580000000001s)]
*  defending you don't know how good your idea is until you're sitting there like jordan pierson [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5935.22s)]
*  didn't know how christian he was until he's sitting with this atheist kid to correct him right [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5939.9400000000005s)]
*  and now he got it and now he got to sit with that and he goes okay how can i better argue that how [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5944.34s)]
*  can i you know maintain the privacy of my faith not let someone pigeonhole me into this if he is [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5948.82s)]
*  truly a christian without making it look like i'm not a non-believer you know and he's gonna have to [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5954.74s)]
*  if he wants to he's gonna have to sit with that i think the democrats can do that it seemed like [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5960.26s)]
*  republicans were more willing to have those conversations and deal with that criticism [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5964.02s)]
*  there's more grace within the party if you get one thing wrong it's like yeah they look the other [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5967.86s)]
*  way maybe too much grace but within the democrats there's no no grace at all i also think there's [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5971.06s)]
*  something about like not being the party in power where you get to point at what the party in power [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5975.54s)]
*  is doing wrong yeah that's a lot easier so they're on the defense because they're the ones in control [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5980.26s)]
*  so if things are going bad and you're in control you have to have a reason for that and if you go [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5984.5s)]
*  on podcasts where they start going hey why is housing so expensive like you got to explain that [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5989.38s)]
*  shit yeah that's true but the party in power is still blaming the party that's no longer in power [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5993.620000000001s)]
*  for everything going wrong that's your work before yeah like you run that shit back but he was one [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=5998.58s)]
*  time before yeah now granted there were some other things that went on you know but like still was [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6004.74s)]
*  one time before yeah so you got to have answers and you got to show people that like things are [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6009.0599999999995s)]
*  trending in the direction that that they feel will make their lives better yeah one of my [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6014.0199999999995s)]
*  favorite moments from the interview with tim and the journalist is like the idea of podcasts as an [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6019.62s)]
*  institution or like an establishment she kept saying podcast establishment yeah and tim did a [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6024.18s)]
*  great job of saying like it's not some type of centralized force where like you have all these [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6027.86s)]
*  journalists that are working under this umbrella that all have this agenda like that's an establishment [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6031.54s)]
*  and so that's one great point but then in addition to that any podcast or whether it's you know like [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6036.66s)]
*  tim rogan any of us anything that we say is then criticized and scrutinized and if there's something [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6041.86s)]
*  that's incorrect that'll be analyzed whereas like the journalists can say things that are incorrect [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6046.9s)]
*  and then there's no scrutiny or recourse for that in any significant way yeah right like there's [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6051.219999999999s)]
*  just a little thing at the bottom so they can say whatever and they're not really scrutinized it kind [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6056.02s)]
*  of can hide under the establishment and that to me proves that the podcast establishment is not really [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6059.780000000001s)]
*  an establishment because you can be criticized for one little mistake you make and then every week [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6065.14s)]
*  we're going to be back on here we're going to have to talk about if it's a big enough story we're [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6070.26s)]
*  going to have to have a conversation yeah and you have to address it you have to correct it like [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6073.3s)]
*  there's has to be some type of recourse whereas it seems like journalists don't have that in the same [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6076.660000000001s)]
*  way i also think and i could be wrong here that there might be a little bit of sometimes i i i get [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6079.7s)]
*  this from like the traditional media sources there's like almost like a um they use like [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6087.7s)]
*  podcasts as like a pejorative almost it's like a podcast bro or like there is this like we would [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6092.26s)]
*  just call it like hate for podcasting not actual hate they don't like despise podcasting but there's [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6098.82s)]
*  like they're like annoyed by it or perturbed by it and um i think there's a little part of me that's [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6104.1s)]
*  like i wonder if some of these traditional media figures lack the confidence to go out on their own [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6110.9800000000005s)]
*  they don't know if people will watch or listen if they're just putting out their own show [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6123.38s)]
*  they have more confidence being part of cnn or part of fox or part of one of these big media [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6128.259999999999s)]
*  establishments but like going out on your own is terrifying because you get to find out if people [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6134.58s)]
*  actually like you or are interested in you and are entertained by you or not it's scary you got [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6139.0599999999995s)]
*  self-financed you got not only self-financed you get to deal with the fact that people either like [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6145.7s)]
*  you or they like the logo and there's a lot of people that aren't willing to take that risk [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6150.9s)]
*  do people like you or the logo and when because at the end of the day a lot of these people are [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6156.58s)]
*  just doing podcasts like that girl's just doing a podcast she doesn't need to do it let me get out [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6162.5s)]
*  like she doesn't need to do it with cnn she could do it with anyone just why would you why would you [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6167.54s)]
*  do it for cnn just do it by yourself and become like one of the biggest interview shows in the [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6172.34s)]
*  world it's like there's a whole podcast studio at wtf where you could hire like take the risk and i [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6176.26s)]
*  think that like we've done it and taken the risk and put our money up but also like put our egos [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6181.62s)]
*  up it could not go well we could find out that people are not interested they just want the logo [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6186.9s)]
*  you know there's people at the new york times that like we might not be interested in if they [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6191.62s)]
*  weren't part of the new york times yeah they're fans of the new york times not necessarily fans [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6194.66s)]
*  of people they're fighters that we watch because they're part of the ufc but we might not watch [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6199.0599999999995s)]
*  them yeah if they went up by themselves like so the brand offers protection and i think sometimes [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6202.58s)]
*  you feel this like scrutiny coming from those specific figures i think part of it deep down [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6208.58s)]
*  is this insecurity of like i don't know if i could go out on my own and i'm upset that they [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6214.42s)]
*  thought that they could and it's working because you're making the same content only you got a [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6218.58s)]
*  daddy yeah what are you saying um i'm not saying you're wrong i'm just saying i don't think all [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6224.0199999999995s)]
*  people intended to put themselves out there in that way like some people like really like [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6231.7s)]
*  journalism like media they totally it used to stand for something you know i i yeah so it's like [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6237.46s)]
*  i do feel there are people that went to school went to journalism school and it's like yo i want to [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6242.82s)]
*  get the truth out there i want to spread the message but i don't care about being the face of [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6247.62s)]
*  i i totally agree with you and i think that like and there's also a version where it's like they [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6252.02s)]
*  want to be able to interview important people but when you do this on your own you got to start [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6256.66s)]
*  with the people that you have built relationships with you know like i don't know if that girl could [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6261.86s)]
*  get an interview tim dillon if she isn't with cnn if she's just that girl you know and like you [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6266.5s)]
*  have to go through like we went through a decade of building up to the point where you could sit [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6271.46s)]
*  down with the president you could sit down with the senator you know you can sit down with a [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6276.02s)]
*  fucking joe rogan you know you can sit down with musicians you can sit down with all these different [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6279.06s)]
*  people and it takes years of your life toiling in obscurity like trying to make ends meet to get there [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6283.22s)]
*  and um so i i think there's a little part of it where there's like a little resentment yeah [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6291.0599999999995s)]
*  that means maybe could be yeah especially i don't want to put that on her specifically but sometimes [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6296.259999999999s)]
*  i do feel that and i don't think he's saying this about all journalists i think he's saying it about [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6300.339999999999s)]
*  the ones who speak about us in like a majority fashion yeah like kind of looking down on us i [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6303.139999999999s)]
*  can think another option would be maybe that's coming from a place of their losing power [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6307.459999999999s)]
*  that's that's a good point too it's like why the fuck do they i'm with this big institution i'm [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6313.379999999999s)]
*  with the big brand i'm doing all these things why the fuck are people watching those four guys [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6317.86s)]
*  just making fun of each other's clothes on a podcast i did everything right i went to journalism [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6322.179999999999s)]
*  school yeah i did the internships i met all the right people and yet this guy that has graduated [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6326.74s)]
*  as comedy is now able to talk to the president why the can i do that yeah yeah that's probably [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6331.86s)]
*  infuriating yeah yeah and to give them some grace we might have been a part of the institutions if [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6336.179999999999s)]
*  they didn't project all our ideas they hated everything we believed in yeah comic central [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6340.98s)]
*  just had to put out a special we'd have no youtube special that's simple all you have to do is just [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6346.98s)]
*  put out one let me fail on your network yeah you could have put out one and failed and then okay [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6351.86s)]
*  we got the answer from the people but then the people decided a different way yeah yeah yeah [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS0wlArWfU&t=6357.219999999999s)]
