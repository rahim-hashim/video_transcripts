# Bryan Johnson is Using A.I. to NEVER DIE: How He Ages Backwards & Has 18 Year Old Erections Forever
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [February 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE)
*  Do humans have to die? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=0.0s)]
*  This is the first moment where we can say death is a maybe. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1.76s)]
*  Brian Johnson is determined to live forever or die trying. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5.64s)]
*  Which he believes may happen in our lifetime. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9.28s)]
*  Everything we understand about reality may be called into question. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=12.4s)]
*  TechGenius is worth $800 million and has pledged almost every cent of it [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=16.72s)]
*  to uncovering the secret to eternal youth. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=21.44s)]
*  If you had an algorithm that could give you the best physical, emotional, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=23.84s)]
*  and spiritual health of your life, would you say yes to it? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=27.84s)]
*  And so we looked through all the scientific evidence [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=30.12s)]
*  and we put all the science into me. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=32.28s)]
*  And then I became the most measured person in human history. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  What's your relationship with God? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=36.28s)]
*  This is such a delicious conversation because I remember in Mormonism. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=37.64s)]
*  Delicious is crazy. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=40.92s)]
*  What's up, everybody? Welcome to Flaygrid. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=44.0s)]
*  And today we are joined by a 46 year old man with an 18 year old cock. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  If that doesn't get you interested, I do not know what will. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=52.44s)]
*  He has spent millions of his own dollars to never die. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=55.68s)]
*  Give it up for Brian Johnson. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=60.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=61.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=62.24s)]
*  First question, and we're going to get to the cock, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=63.56s)]
*  we're going to get to all these different things, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=65.24s)]
*  but do humans have to die? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=66.4s)]
*  For the first time in human history, it's a question. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=70.76s)]
*  It's a maybe. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=73.08s)]
*  This is the thing. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=74.68s)]
*  This is the most significant revolution in 200,000 years of being a homo sapiens. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=75.44s)]
*  Death has always been inevitable. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=80.36s)]
*  And that leads to all the solutions we've had about death. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=82.12s)]
*  We say live fast, die young. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=84.96s)]
*  We create religions. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=86.27999999999999s)]
*  We create stories about death, how it renews and how it's great. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=87.11999999999999s)]
*  But this is the first moment after 4.5 billion years where we can say death is a maybe. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=90.16s)]
*  And why do you feel it's a maybe? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=95.96s)]
*  If you look at the speed of progress of artificial intelligence [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=98.55999999999999s)]
*  and the gains in medical technologies, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=102.96s)]
*  it's possible that we will be able to arrest aging. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  Can you explain how AI would help? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=108.83999999999999s)]
*  So if you take... [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=111.19999999999999s)]
*  All right, so humans are the most intelligent... [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=112.48s)]
*  We are a formidable form of intelligence. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=117.56s)]
*  Humans can solve things that other biological species cannot solve. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=119.4s)]
*  We've built computers. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  We built the internet. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  We can go to the moon. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=126.68s)]
*  And so humans have this formidable form of intelligence. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=128.56s)]
*  We do these things. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=130.76s)]
*  Now, if you say AI is this new form of intelligence, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=132.24s)]
*  it can do the things we can do and it can do other things better. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=134.88s)]
*  And it's improving at a rate that we can't even imagine. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=138.32s)]
*  So if you apply AI to the problems we're trying to solve in any domain, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=141.48s)]
*  it's stunningly good. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=145.72s)]
*  So for example, you take a problem where an alpha fold. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=147.0s)]
*  This is DeepMind. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=150.48s)]
*  Google owns this AI company. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=151.92s)]
*  They try to figure out how do proteins fold. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=153.64s)]
*  Proteins are a string of amino acids. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=155.92s)]
*  And there's more possibilities of proteins folding than there are atoms in the universe. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=158.16s)]
*  It's this computational problem that is unimaginable. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=161.72s)]
*  And everyone thought it was going to be impossible. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=164.28s)]
*  Alpha fold solved it computationally. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=165.92s)]
*  And so it's able to take these impossibly hard problems [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=169.12s)]
*  and solve them at stunning speed. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  So the idea is that it could be applied to reversing aging [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  or reversing the decay of organs. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=179.4s)]
*  And if you could position it in that way, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=180.84s)]
*  we could solve these problems that look like they're outside of our world. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=182.88000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you said arresting aging, but it seems your goal is reversing. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=184.8s)]
*  Because arresting aging, if you're 80, who gives a fuck? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=188.28s)]
*  You can take me. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=191.60000000000002s)]
*  So you think reversing aging, not just arresting? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=192.56s)]
*  Both, yeah. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=194.84s)]
*  There's slowing the speed of aging, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=195.4s)]
*  and then there's reversing aging damage that has happened. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=197.08s)]
*  There are two distinct problems. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=199.4s)]
*  Do black people age better? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=201.12s)]
*  Have you ever tried shooting some black guy in? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=204.52s)]
*  I've heard it doesn't crack. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=207.8s)]
*  Maybe that's why you age so well, because you have a very black name. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=209.4s)]
*  You might be an albino black. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=211.96s)]
*  Brian Johnson, we did think that you were a black dude, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=213.16000000000003s)]
*  but Brian was a white. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=215.68s)]
*  It's a little cultural appropriation. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=216.68s)]
*  Brian was a white. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=219.4s)]
*  But do they? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=221.32000000000002s)]
*  I mean, you've looked into how people age. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=222.0s)]
*  It seems like sometimes black people age really well. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=223.68s)]
*  Yeah, so it's just like people know how much money [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=226.44s)]
*  they have in their bank account. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=228.6s)]
*  They know how many social media followers they have. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=229.84s)]
*  They know how much they weigh. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=231.8s)]
*  Soon, everyone's going to know their speed of aging. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  There's a clock inside of you. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=236.24s)]
*  It's the one time black people are slower. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=237.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=239.12s)]
*  That should mean there's clocks. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=240.12s)]
*  There's clocks showing you. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=242.36s)]
*  Are you saying? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=244.36s)]
*  It proves that not all white people age bad. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=246.36s)]
*  Like, so bad. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=247.84s)]
*  But you're aging like a regular black guy. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=249.64000000000001s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=251.64s)]
*  But have they found that out that there are certain races [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=257.88s)]
*  that just age a little bit better? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=260.03999999999996s)]
*  That is an interesting question. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=261.44s)]
*  Al's 73 years old. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=262.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=263.44s)]
*  He drinks Kool-Aid four times a day. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=264.44s)]
*  Three. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=267.44s)]
*  There's data showing that different people [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=269.44s)]
*  in different circumstances, in different environments, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=272.32s)]
*  different lifestyles have different clocks. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=273.91999999999996s)]
*  So we're starting to get a bigger picture [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=275.84s)]
*  where we can get a very granular understanding [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=277.2s)]
*  of what it means to be a given person [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=280.24s)]
*  in a given environment with a certain lifestyle. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  And so yeah, I started doing this. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=284.72s)]
*  I lowered my speed of aging the equivalent of 31 years. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=287.08s)]
*  So my body now clocks age at a speed slower [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=290.72s)]
*  than 86% of 18-year-olds. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=294.12s)]
*  So as you age, as you get older, you age faster. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=296.40000000000003s)]
*  It compounds. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=299.64s)]
*  You see this? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=300.48s)]
*  Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that makes sense. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=301.32s)]
*  You just see it, it just starts. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=302.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=303.0s)]
*  It's a compounded law. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  And so younger people accumulate aging damage [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=305.2s)]
*  at a slower speed. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=308.04s)]
*  And so you wanna take your aging clock [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=309.56s)]
*  down as much as possible. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=312.44s)]
*  Is there a predictive power to that? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=313.28s)]
*  So like in 10 years, how old do you think you'll look [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=314.76s)]
*  or how old will you have aged? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=317.64s)]
*  Yeah, so these clocks are new. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=319.52s)]
*  They're based upon a technology called DNA methylation. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=321.56s)]
*  They're not yet gold standard evidence. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=324.56s)]
*  They're still what's called silver standard [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=327.0s)]
*  because they're not tied to all cause mortality [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=328.64s)]
*  where if you have markers like cholesterol [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=331.71999999999997s)]
*  or other things that have a lot more data, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=333.68s)]
*  phenotypic markers. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=335.71999999999997s)]
*  And so it's really an emergent phenomenon, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=337.08s)]
*  but it's cool to say like, what's my clock? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=339.04s)]
*  So having a baby is stressful. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=340.72s)]
*  For you and your partner, everyone. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=345.36s)]
*  And so it would be interesting to look at your clock [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=347.64000000000004s)]
*  before pregnancy, during pregnancy, post birth. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=351.32000000000005s)]
*  The clock is the rate of aging. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=354.8s)]
*  It's not your what we would call like true age. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=356.92s)]
*  So you're 46 years old, but what would your true age be [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=359.68s)]
*  if you could, I don't know how you would figure that out. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=364.24s)]
*  So I'm hundreds of different ages. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=368.40000000000003s)]
*  So for example, my left ear is 64. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=370.04s)]
*  My heart is 37. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=373.96000000000004s)]
*  My cardiovascular capacity is in the top 1.5% [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=375.88s)]
*  of 18 year olds. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=379.08000000000004s)]
*  My diaphragm is age 18. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=379.92s)]
*  So I've measured, becoming the most measured person [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=381.6s)]
*  in history, we said the only way to understand age [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=384.40000000000003s)]
*  is you have to look at every organ of the body [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=386.72s)]
*  and then age that organ. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=388.92s)]
*  And so you know intuitively that a baby's heart [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=390.40000000000003s)]
*  is different than a 90 year old heart. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=393.04s)]
*  They look different, function different. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=394.52000000000004s)]
*  They have different cells. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=396.52000000000004s)]
*  And so we basically said how do you age [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=398.71999999999997s)]
*  every part of my body? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=399.56s)]
*  Sorry, the ear thing is like your hearing is bad [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=400.4s)]
*  or just the ears, because I know ears continue to grow. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=403.28s)]
*  Is that all it is? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=405.44s)]
*  Yeah, looking at my ability to hear sounds. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=406.84s)]
*  So between 4,000 hertz and 12,000 hertz, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=409.56s)]
*  I'm basically deaf because I shot a lot of guns as a kid. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=411.96s)]
*  And so I was right handed [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=415.56s)]
*  and so I got the exposure on my left ear. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=416.84s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=418.84s)]
*  And so we still haven't been able to figure out [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=419.68s)]
*  how to fix hearing damage on the ear. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=421.4s)]
*  But yeah, that's one example where you look [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=424.36s)]
*  at my 18 year old son, same test and he's got [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=425.96000000000004s)]
*  straight line hearing all the frequencies. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=428.8s)]
*  I'm deaf in that range. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=431.76s)]
*  So you get this good enough to actually turn back age. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=432.8s)]
*  Let's say hypothetical scenario, right? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=435.44s)]
*  Where people can bring their this real or actual age [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=438.16s)]
*  to bring it down. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=443.36s)]
*  Do we start treating people based on their actual age then? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=445.20000000000005s)]
*  Maybe we don't use actual, their health age? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=449.44s)]
*  What is the word? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=452.28000000000003s)]
*  Biological age or internal age? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=453.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, a woman was hitting on me yesterday [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=455.0s)]
*  and was like, I don't know if I'm of age. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=456.59999999999997s)]
*  But you could be, it's complicated. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=459.28s)]
*  You could be too young for her. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=461.64s)]
*  You could be below the belt. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=462.47999999999996s)]
*  But I'm saying. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=463.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=464.28s)]
*  Oh, she could be molesting you. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=465.12s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=466.44s)]
*  Oh. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=467.28s)]
*  He's an 18 year old boy. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=468.12s)]
*  I'm just a different, oh my God. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=469.2s)]
*  Yeah, you can't even have sex anymore. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=470.68s)]
*  Exactly, so I'm playing, but like kind of. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=472.56s)]
*  Are you afraid like your erections are gonna go too young? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=474.67999999999995s)]
*  Like, they're 18, but what if they keep going down? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=477.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=479.4s)]
*  14. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=480.24s)]
*  Pedophiles are gonna come after you [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=481.08s)]
*  and that will be kind of legal. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=481.91999999999996s)]
*  Also, they found a way around the system. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=485.35999999999996s)]
*  It's so funny, he's such a man, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=487.0s)]
*  the things they figured out first is cock his abs. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=488.03999999999996s)]
*  He's like, hang on. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=490.68s)]
*  He's like, hang on. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=492.59999999999997s)]
*  I'm gonna do it. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=493.68s)]
*  I'm like, I'm gonna do it. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=494.52s)]
*  This is being taught to me. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=495.35999999999996s)]
*  Hey. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=497.15999999999997s)]
*  No, you really figured it out. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=498.0s)]
*  Yeah, good job. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=499.96s)]
*  You can't hear women and you can have sex all the time. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=501.79999999999995s)]
*  I mean, that was the truth, right? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=506.71999999999997s)]
*  The perfect man. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=507.76s)]
*  Stop working. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=508.59999999999997s)]
*  The perfect man. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=509.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=511.71999999999997s)]
*  Are there, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=513.4s)]
*  because the average person is not gonna do what you're doing. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=514.64s)]
*  Right, like at this point in time, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=517.3199999999999s)]
*  the average person just doesn't have the time. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=518.7199999999999s)]
*  I know that you think they're capable of it, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=521.04s)]
*  but we're gonna go into like [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=523.64s)]
*  how sophisticated your routine is [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=525.8399999999999s)]
*  and they might not just have that discipline, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=527.4799999999999s)]
*  they might not have that time. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=528.8399999999999s)]
*  You might have not had that time [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=529.7199999999999s)]
*  at a different part of your life. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=531.1199999999999s)]
*  Can we just start baseline? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=533.1999999999999s)]
*  What are like the five, six, 10 things [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=534.5999999999999s)]
*  that the average person can do [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=539.04s)]
*  that doesn't change their life too much, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=540.88s)]
*  but can greatly impact longevity or slowing that clock? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=543.32s)]
*  Yeah, so it's really good news. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=546.76s)]
*  There's a few power laws everybody has access to. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=548.4399999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=550.92s)]
*  And you get the majority of the benefits that I've achieved. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=551.76s)]
*  So one is don't smoke. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=553.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=555.72s)]
*  That takes around 13 years of life off. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=556.56s)]
*  Fuck, 13? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=558.32s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=560.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=560.84s)]
*  What about an occasional, like, you know, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=561.68s)]
*  you're out at a bar once a week. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=563.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=567.16s)]
*  Is that taste still taking off 13? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=568.72s)]
*  Is it the same as somebody who smokes daily? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=571.2399999999999s)]
*  I don't actually know what the quantity is. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=572.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=575.3599999999999s)]
*  But I suspect it probably, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=576.1999999999999s)]
*  if the power laws probably just don't smoke generally. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=577.2399999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=579.64s)]
*  All right, don't smoke. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=580.8399999999999s)]
*  Don't smoke. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=581.68s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=582.52s)]
*  Yep, the second power law is exercise six hours a week. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=583.3599999999999s)]
*  And so that's, the nuances are four and a half hours [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=587.3599999999999s)]
*  in zone two through four. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=591.4s)]
*  So that's your heart rate of like 120-ish through 150, 160. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=592.52s)]
*  And then 90 minutes above, 159-ish, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=596.4399999999999s)]
*  it depends upon your chronological age. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=599.88s)]
*  Number three is a blueprint or a Mediterranean-like diet. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=602.04s)]
*  Number four is a BMI of 18.5 to 22.5. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=606.8s)]
*  What is Mediterranean-like diet? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=609.92s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=612.28s)]
*  It's like the blueprint diet is a lot of vegetables, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=613.12s)]
*  lentils, berries, nuts, seeds. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=616.4s)]
*  I personally am a vegetarian. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=619.64s)]
*  I'm vegan, but people can do meat, it's fine. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=621.4399999999999s)]
*  It's basically, it's a diet that excludes junk food, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=624.04s)]
*  fast food, packaged food. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=629.4399999999999s)]
*  Packaged food, sugars, yep. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=631.36s)]
*  Just like trying to avoid the bad stuff. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=633.24s)]
*  And why meat? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=635.1999999999999s)]
*  Why aren't you on the meat? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=636.04s)]
*  It's because we are baby steps away from superintelligence. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=637.8s)]
*  And I hope that as superintelligence emerges, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=644.7199999999999s)]
*  there is a scaling law that as intelligence increases, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=648.68s)]
*  compassion corresponds with a one-to-one ratio. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=652.56s)]
*  So it's not a health thing, it's an ethical thing. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=656.76s)]
*  It is a I hope we survive existence thing. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=659.08s)]
*  And so I, in a way. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=663.16s)]
*  So yeah, you're trying to control [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=664.92s)]
*  all these internal variables. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=666.76s)]
*  You mean compassion to like the chickens. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=667.6s)]
*  Compassion, compassion for all that's helpless. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=669.64s)]
*  I was so good, I was like, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=672.56s)]
*  we're gonna get nice to each other [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=675.28s)]
*  once we get superintelligent. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=676.48s)]
*  I didn't really, but. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=677.72s)]
*  I really think he's doing all this work internally. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=678.56s)]
*  And imagine the environment falls apart, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=681.36s)]
*  this guy's trying to live forever, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=682.88s)]
*  and then the earth explodes and it's like, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=683.92s)]
*  well, why do I do all this work? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=686.0s)]
*  Yeah, so like here's like the essence [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=687.5600000000001s)]
*  of everything I'm doing. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=690.1600000000001s)]
*  So the thought experiment is this. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=691.32s)]
*  So imagine if we could whisper in the ear [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=692.84s)]
*  of those who lived in 1870, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=694.76s)]
*  we would say, there are new ideas [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=696.8000000000001s)]
*  about these microscopic objects that cause infection. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=699.8000000000001s)]
*  They're called germs. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=703.2s)]
*  Now, if you lived the 1870s, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=704.88s)]
*  you'd probably hear them be like, that's fucking nuts. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=706.0s)]
*  You're telling me the shit I can't see with my eyes. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=708.1600000000001s)]
*  What a conspiracy theory this guy is. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=711.6s)]
*  Misinformation, yeah. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=714.0s)]
*  If you were open-minded, you'd say, huh, okay. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=716.8s)]
*  So you're telling me the doctor should maybe wash hands [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=719.8s)]
*  before, between surgeries, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=722.24s)]
*  clean the instruments before doing this or that. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=724.12s)]
*  The majority of people would be like, that's fucking stupid. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=726.4s)]
*  And you probably died. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=729.8399999999999s)]
*  Now, if you were open-minded, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=731.52s)]
*  and so the question for us is, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=732.5999999999999s)]
*  if the 25th century could whisper in our ears, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=733.88s)]
*  what would they say? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=737.0799999999999s)]
*  They'd say, psst. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=738.3599999999999s)]
*  Stop drinking. What? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=739.56s)]
*  Stop smoking. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=741.16s)]
*  Yeah, stop the cruelty and the suffering [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=742.1999999999999s)]
*  of other organisms on earth, probably. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=744.96s)]
*  I don't know if they're going that far. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=747.44s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if they're going that far. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=749.52s)]
*  Especially because they're still gonna be eating chicken [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=751.0s)]
*  in the 26th century. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=752.84s)]
*  When there is 3D printed meat and all that stuff, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=753.96s)]
*  you have no issue at that point of eating. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=756.2s)]
*  Who ages the best? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=757.96s)]
*  Black people, not saying they love chicken. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=759.52s)]
*  I'm just saying there might be certain protein solutions [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=761.72s)]
*  that fit within the diet. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=765.36s)]
*  Sure, I mean, this is the thing is like, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=767.88s)]
*  meat is, veganism or meat, it's so tribal. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=769.5600000000001s)]
*  The moment you bring up a topic, it's just warfare. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=773.4s)]
*  And it's like, I just don't wanna step into it. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=776.68s)]
*  It's fine, do your thing. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=778.68s)]
*  He's like, keep killing yourself. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=781.12s)]
*  I'm on that front. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=782.68s)]
*  I think what the 25th century says is they say, don't die. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=784.48s)]
*  If you think about this from a century time scale, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=789.76s)]
*  we look at the 15th century and we say, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=792.04s)]
*  okay, there's 20 things from the 15th century that matter. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=794.04s)]
*  Everything else, we're just like, ah, didn't happen. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=797.64s)]
*  And the same thing is true for the 17th century. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=799.96s)]
*  99.9% of what we do today in this world [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=802.4399999999999s)]
*  is gonna be gone. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=805.3599999999999s)]
*  Completely forgotten. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=806.1999999999999s)]
*  Just forgotten. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=807.04s)]
*  So from the 25th century vantage point. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=807.88s)]
*  And so don't die is, don't die individually, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=811.04s)]
*  don't kill each other, don't kill the planet [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=814.28s)]
*  and align super intelligence with don't die. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=816.3599999999999s)]
*  If you basically say, okay, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=820.4399999999999s)]
*  we are baby steps away from super intelligence. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=821.9599999999999s)]
*  What do we do? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=823.4s)]
*  Do we use AI to fight better wars? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=824.4399999999999s)]
*  Do we use AI to kill people better? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=826.7199999999999s)]
*  Do we use AI to create more social media followers? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=829.0s)]
*  What is the essence of what's happening in the universe [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=832.6s)]
*  in this moment on this planet at this moment? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=836.6s)]
*  Can you break down super intelligence to us plebes over here? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=838.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's probably how like an insect intelligence [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=842.84s)]
*  views us. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=848.6800000000001s)]
*  Like somewhere on that spectra of what can an insect [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=851.24s)]
*  accomplish with its intelligence? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=854.76s)]
*  And then what can we accomplish with our intelligence? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=856.6800000000001s)]
*  And you make that, you do that comparison and you say, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=858.64s)]
*  we are probably a few orders of magnitude more intelligent [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=862.4s)]
*  than that form of intelligence. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=866.72s)]
*  And AI is going to be orders of magnitude [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=868.88s)]
*  more intelligent like a million. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=873.0s)]
*  Is it limitless intelligence? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=873.84s)]
*  I mean, TBD on what the scaling laws of intelligence are, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=876.28s)]
*  but whether it's a million times smarter than us [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=880.48s)]
*  or a billion times smarter than us, it's that. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=883.48s)]
*  And so if you say, and if you look at the speed [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=887.3199999999999s)]
*  in which it's progressing, it's we can't internalize. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=889.16s)]
*  Like we are, even though we try, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=893.64s)]
*  we are blinded to a speed of progress. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=895.4s)]
*  And so if you say, if this is a situation [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=898.4s)]
*  where we are on this continuum of intelligence [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=900.56s)]
*  and there's this new thing emergent, what do we do? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=902.36s)]
*  And then you say, okay, hey, capitalism, what's the answer? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=907.0s)]
*  Or hey, socialism or hey, religion or hey, whatever. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=910.0799999999999s)]
*  So whatever ideological movement you want to point to [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=914.84s)]
*  or structure, and to me, there's no answers in society. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=918.2s)]
*  Nobody knows what to do. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=922.36s)]
*  So when you talk about the 25th century, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=925.6s)]
*  it is conceivable in your mind [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=927.08s)]
*  that you could be talking about yourself 400 years from now [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=928.48s)]
*  and be like, oh, this is what I thought 400 years ago. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=931.48s)]
*  Yes, that basically when they say, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=933.44s)]
*  when you listen into their conversation, they say, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=936.12s)]
*  we appreciate the 21st century [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=940.76s)]
*  because in that moment, they did this [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=944.1999999999999s)]
*  that allowed intelligence to thrive [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=946.92s)]
*  in this part of the galaxy. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=948.6s)]
*  What did they do? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=949.52s)]
*  Like how do they compress the whole 21st century? [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=950.36s)]
*  They figured out the only thing to do was don't die. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=953.3199999999999s)]
*  That was the single imperative of all intelligent life. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=957.52s)]
*  Why? So you wanna be a Magellan? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=961.72s)]
*  Yes, and Ernest Shackleton. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=963.72s)]
*  Oh. Yeah. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=965.68s)]
*  And basically I view myself as an explorer [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=966.52s)]
*  to say in this time and place, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=968.72s)]
*  what is the most ambitious and impactful thing? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=970.8s)]
*  I genuinely, I care more about what the 25th century [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=973.96s)]
*  thinks of me than I do right now. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=976.0s)]
*  I see you talking about that a lot. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=977.12s)]
*  I don't care what anyone thinks about me right now. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=978.48s)]
*  And is it because you have admiration [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=979.88s)]
*  for these people in the past? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=982.16s)]
*  My education's primarily from reading biographies. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=984.44s)]
*  And so I'm reading people of previous centuries [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=986.96s)]
*  who do impossibly hard things. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=989.16s)]
*  And it's as predictable as anything [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=990.48s)]
*  that they do a given thing or see a given thing, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=992.32s)]
*  everyone shits on them. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=994.6s)]
*  They do it anyways, it becomes inevitable. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=996.48s)]
*  And then society adopts it. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=999.04s)]
*  Galileo. We all forget that. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=999.96s)]
*  Take your pick of any number of examples. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1002.6400000000001s)]
*  And so if you care what people think right now, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1004.88s)]
*  you're playing a game of the moment, which is fine. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1007.84s)]
*  Like definitely a cool game to play. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1009.7600000000001s)]

*  But March 14th through 16th, Donnie a Beach. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1117.68s)]
*  Let's sell out. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1119.5600000000002s)]
*  You know what I mean, Miami, let's do this. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1120.4s)]
*  AkashSingh.com, let's go. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1121.5200000000002s)]
*  When did you develop that? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1122.96s)]
*  Do you always have that? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1123.92s)]
*  Because you used to be a much more emotional person, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1124.76s)]
*  it seems, based on the way you talk about your past life. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1126.2s)]
*  I've really, yeah, I guess I've really always enjoyed [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1130.72s)]
*  playing on different times. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1133.92s)]
*  School was very hard for me. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1135.1200000000001s)]
*  I really hated being sitting in class. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1136.5200000000002s)]
*  It was so slow and boring. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1139.5800000000002s)]
*  I just wanted to go out and learn on my own. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1141.88s)]
*  And I found biographies to be the coolest way to learn [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1143.3000000000002s)]
*  because you could really sink in and understand [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1148.4s)]
*  the person and their time and place. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1149.84s)]
*  Like not just read about World War II, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1151.4s)]
*  but read about someone who lived during World War II [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1152.56s)]
*  and what was happening. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1155.72s)]
*  How did Nazi Germany rise? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1156.6399999999999s)]
*  What was it like to live in that society [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1158.48s)]
*  versus this person got assassinated and it triggered this war [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1160.84s)]
*  and then this army moved from this front. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1163.36s)]
*  So yeah, I wanted to understand reality [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1165.32s)]
*  with the level of granularity that I'm to model out [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1167.72s)]
*  what happened to that timeframe. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1169.8799999999999s)]
*  So you thought understanding their specific lives [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1172.48s)]
*  gave a better understanding of the scenario [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1174.58s)]
*  that they were in. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1176.18s)]
*  They were my friends in my mind. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1178.08s)]
*  When I wanted to talk to somebody about a given problem, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1180.76s)]
*  I had studied them so much. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1183.52s)]
*  What would Shackleton do? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1184.36s)]
*  So your peers, so your peers' approval you want [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1186.0s)]
*  is past figures in history, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1189.4399999999998s)]
*  not the people you're around from a young age. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1191.6999999999998s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1193.52s)]
*  Now that's fucking fascinating. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1194.36s)]
*  Does your wealth not play a part? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1196.6399999999999s)]
*  Because I've noticed a lot of billionaires [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1198.1799999999998s)]
*  get a lot of money and then all of a sudden [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1200.1999999999998s)]
*  they don't want to die and they're all trying [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1201.84s)]
*  to live forever, put their consciousness in some AI [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1203.3999999999999s)]
*  and freeze their body or something like that. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1206.48s)]
*  Does the wealth have anything to do with it? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1208.72s)]
*  So actually it was a goal of mine. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1211.96s)]
*  At the age of 21, I came back from Ecuador. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1213.66s)]
*  I lived among extreme poverty there, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1216.18s)]
*  dirt floors, mud huts. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1218.08s)]
*  And my reality had changed. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1219.3600000000001s)]
*  After being there for two years, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1221.76s)]
*  I'm fully immersed in this culture. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1222.92s)]
*  I came back to the US. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1225.0s)]
*  The only thing I cared about was trying [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1226.0s)]
*  to make the human race better. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1228.28s)]
*  I just had this fire burning and I didn't know what to do. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1229.84s)]
*  I wasn't good at anything. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1232.46s)]
*  I didn't really have any skillset. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1233.56s)]
*  Credit card processing is the natural help for humanity. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1235.04s)]
*  Yeah, like fog and mirror, you're qualified. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1238.28s)]
*  Legit, I just had nothing that I was good at. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1240.28s)]
*  So I said I'm gonna make a whole bunch of money [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1243.04s)]
*  by the age of 30 and then with money [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1244.32s)]
*  I'm going to do something interesting. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1246.0s)]
*  And then I set off to make money as the only objective. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1247.48s)]
*  And then when I made the money, the question was, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1250.44s)]
*  okay, I made it, what do I do? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1252.48s)]
*  Like back on that 21 year old goal. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1255.52s)]
*  You can live forever to work your way out of the debt. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1257.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1259.36s)]
*  Try to compensate costs. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1260.2s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1262.12s)]
*  Okay, so the goal was just get as much money [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1263.04s)]
*  as you possibly can and then you can make that change. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1265.72s)]
*  But it was always make change. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1268.1599999999999s)]
*  At what point does it become, I'm gonna stop us from dying? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1270.96s)]
*  It was that thought experiment. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1275.84s)]
*  So after I made the money, it was in 2013, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1277.12s)]
*  I made a few hundred million dollars [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1279.6399999999999s)]
*  from selling my company, Braintree Vemo. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1280.92s)]
*  But then like my life was on fire. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1282.8799999999999s)]
*  So I had three kids, I was depressed for a decade, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1286.06s)]
*  chronically depressed for a decade. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1290.3999999999999s)]
*  Suicidal? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1291.24s)]
*  Yes, I desperately wanted to end my life. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1292.18s)]
*  Like every day it was my only wish. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1295.66s)]
*  Okay, so you have this gold burning inside you, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1297.54s)]
*  which is to save humanity. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1299.94s)]
*  And at the exact same time, you wanna kill yourself. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1301.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1303.7s)]
*  Wow, I knew about that. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1304.54s)]
*  Desperately. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1305.38s)]
*  Yeah, put the oxygen mask on first, bro. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1306.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's true. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1308.66s)]
*  That's what they say. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1309.5s)]
*  It's legit. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1310.3400000000001s)]
*  And I was in a 13 year marriage that we were struggling [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1311.54s)]
*  and then I just sold my company, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1315.3s)]
*  then I was leaving my religion. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1316.78s)]
*  So like everything was broken in my life. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1318.46s)]
*  And so I first had to get the mask on the face. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1321.74s)]
*  And so in one year's time, I ended the marriage, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1325.86s)]
*  I sold my company, I emerged from chronic depression [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1328.1399999999999s)]
*  and left the religion. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1332.8999999999999s)]
*  And then I moved to New York. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1337.06s)]
*  And you went to Brooklyn [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1339.86s)]
*  and you went to a house party for six hours. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1341.02s)]
*  Yeah, I went to. Is that true? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1342.98s)]
*  I went to Brooklyn, I went to a warehouse party. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1344.22s)]
*  I did. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1346.4399999999998s)]
*  And it was my first time, I went with some friends [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1347.28s)]
*  and for the first time in my entire life, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1349.72s)]
*  I started dancing. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1352.68s)]
*  Cause I grew up, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1355.28s)]
*  like we didn't really move our bodies very much. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1356.1200000000001s)]
*  And I started dancing at midnight or one, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1358.96s)]
*  whenever we started. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1360.8s)]
*  I believe it's called soaking, right? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1361.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1363.24s)]
*  It emerged after me, I missed that. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1364.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1366.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1367.48s)]
*  Dude, you would have been so happy. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1368.32s)]
*  There would have been more of it in this day. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1371.08s)]
*  He was soaking. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1373.1200000000001s)]
*  His skin would be forever changed [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1373.96s)]
*  if he could just soak in that thing. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1375.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1376.56s)]
*  For sure. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1377.4s)]
*  And so then I danced for six hours. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1378.72s)]
*  Then I was asking my friends. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1380.64s)]
*  Molly, Molly, Molly, were you on some? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1381.84s)]
*  No. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1383.72s)]
*  No drugs, nothing? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1384.56s)]
*  This is just sober. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1385.4s)]
*  Yeah, for a Mormon, it's like, you know, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1386.4s)]
*  you don't need the Mormon throw party. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1387.72s)]
*  Now he was drinking a lot in his unhappiness. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1389.64s)]
*  No, no, no alcohol, no caffeine. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1391.88s)]
*  Were you not drinking a lot? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1394.56s)]
*  No, just partying like music and dancing. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1395.4s)]
*  So tame. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1396.84s)]
*  It's so tame. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1397.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1399.52s)]
*  Sorry, I thought you were drinking a lot before that, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1400.36s)]
*  right, when you're depressed and you're still okay. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1402.82s)]
*  No, no, yeah, just not part of the culture. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1404.24s)]
*  Okay, yeah. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1406.44s)]
*  So it was like 6 a.m. I was like. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1407.28s)]
*  You're dancing, you're rocking. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1408.12s)]
*  And what does it feel like? [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1409.16s)]
*  Is it the greatest night of your life? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1410.32s)]
*  Best night of my life. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1412.3999999999999s)]
*  To this day? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1413.8799999999999s)]
*  To this, like, on one of the biggest, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1414.72s)]
*  one of the most important moments in my entire life. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1416.3999999999999s)]
*  And it was just like, my mind up until that point [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1418.08s)]
*  had, I had lived in an existence where it was, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1420.68s)]
*  here's what you can do as a human, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1423.0s)]
*  a list of things you can and can't do. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1425.06s)]
*  And that moment, it became a list, not a list, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1427.6399999999999s)]
*  it just became everything I could do. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1430.6s)]
*  And my body moving was this representation of my mind [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1432.84s)]
*  now being able to move in any direction it wanted. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1436.32s)]
*  And it was just this spectacular moment of existence [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1438.96s)]
*  where I, I don't know, somehow unlocked the body, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1442.3s)]
*  unlocked the mind, and it just worked. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1445.0s)]
*  And in a warehouse in Brooklyn. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1446.8799999999999s)]
*  So you ask, next day, what happens? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1450.4399999999998s)]
*  What's going through your mind? [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1452.24s)]
*  You wake up. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1453.24s)]
*  I'm like, where are we dancing next? [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1454.06s)]
*  Where are we going? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1455.4399999999998s)]
*  You start chasing a little bit. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1457.24s)]
*  Yeah, it was, yeah, I had a crew, we were hanging out, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1458.84s)]
*  we went to parties all the time, we're always dancing. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1461.04s)]
*  And I'm not even a good dancer. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1464.28s)]
*  I just really enjoy moving my body. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1466.6399999999999s)]
*  And yeah, then it was this question [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1469.04s)]
*  where I just got fixated on this question, what do you do? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1470.48s)]
*  So you have a few hundred million dollars, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1473.56s)]
*  you can do something, one thing, what do you do? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1475.96s)]
*  And I knew when I chose that given thing, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1479.24s)]
*  it was going to take me a few decades to build. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1481.6399999999999s)]
*  So you can't miss, you can't be off. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1484.1599999999999s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1486.6799999999998s)]
*  I see, I see, I see, I see, I see, I see. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1488.1999999999998s)]
*  Okay, okay, okay. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1489.6s)]
*  So how long is that deliberation period? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1490.4199999999998s)]
*  A decade. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1494.32s)]
*  So it's 10 years figuring out what that project [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1495.16s)]
*  is gonna be. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1497.3600000000001s)]
*  What are some of the other projects that you've dabbled in [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1498.2s)]
*  that you're like, eh, this ain't it? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1500.68s)]
*  Yeah, so the first thing I did. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1502.3600000000001s)]
*  DJ. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1503.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1504.72s)]
*  Yes? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1505.56s)]
*  No, I wanted to start DJing because I wanted to, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1506.4s)]
*  I wanted to do the music. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1509.08s)]
*  I just started tap dancing though. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1510.3600000000001s)]
*  I want... [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1512.1200000000001s)]
*  Brian, stop it. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1512.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1514.28s)]
*  Brian, we need you to tap dance. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1515.1200000000001s)]
*  We're gonna have to do it. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1519.64s)]
*  At some point today, we're tap dancing. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1521.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's good material. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1524.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1525.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1525.92s)]
*  Tap dance is better than that. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1526.76s)]
*  Tap dance is better than that. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1529.76s)]
*  Okay, okay, okay. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1531.76s)]
*  Tap dance. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1533.24s)]
*  Sorry, so yeah, the first thing I did is I put [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1535.16s)]
*  $100 million into a venture fund. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1537.28s)]
*  I started investing, so this hypothesis was [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1539.28s)]
*  science allows us to engineer atoms and molecules [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1543.3600000000001s)]
*  and organisms, so we can engineer physical reality. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1546.52s)]
*  So we're very good at computers and programming software, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1549.44s)]
*  but if we have a problem like, hey, the coral reef [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1552.36s)]
*  can't sustain the heat levels in the ocean, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1554.6399999999999s)]
*  how do you redesign coral reef? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1557.2s)]
*  Can you actually design the biological system of coral reef? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1558.9199999999998s)]
*  So I started investing in companies doing that [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1562.52s)]
*  and I made 42 investments. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1564.12s)]
*  And like one company, for example, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1565.8799999999999s)]
*  if you take a problem like you want rose oil, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1568.2s)]
*  because rose oil is an input for a fragrance or something, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1571.0s)]
*  you plant a seed, it grows into a plant, you water it, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1573.96s)]
*  you fertilize it, you harvest it, and you get rose oil. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1577.12s)]
*  Now the other alternative is you take a yeast cell, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1580.68s)]
*  you program the yeast cell to manufacture rose oil. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1583.24s)]
*  You don't need to grow it in a field, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1585.8400000000001s)]
*  you don't need to fertilize, you don't need the water, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1587.44s)]
*  you don't need all the- [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1589.1200000000001s)]
*  Much faster process. Much faster. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1589.96s)]
*  And you can do that with almost anything. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1591.1200000000001s)]
*  And so I invested in companies that were programming [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1594.3600000000001s)]
*  physical reality, or even another company doing atoms, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1596.92s)]
*  like atom by atom by Lego structures to build new filters [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1599.52s)]
*  or to build new structures to hold gas [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1602.96s)]
*  or like there's infinite number of varieties. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1605.16s)]
*  And so I was trying to basically say, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1607.5600000000002s)]
*  we as a species, and this is before the pandemic, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1610.24s)]
*  I said we need to build a global biological immune system [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1612.0s)]
*  where we build the infrastructure [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1616.04s)]
*  that allows this continued survival, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1618.52s)]
*  but we need to do so at a biological and atomic level. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1620.9199999999998s)]
*  So I spent, because I wanted to basically be [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1623.84s)]
*  in the trenches of deep tech, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1625.4399999999998s)]
*  like what's happening in science. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1626.9199999999998s)]
*  And so I had to hang out with these PhD entrepreneurs [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1628.8s)]
*  and I learned about all things science. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1631.1999999999998s)]
*  It was for the first time in my life. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1634.3999999999999s)]
*  That was fun. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1636.0s)]
*  And then I built a brain interface company [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1636.84s)]
*  where we were trying to figure out, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1638.84s)]
*  so just like when you buy- [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1641.04s)]
*  Is this kernel? [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1642.32s)]
*  It's kernel. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1643.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1644.0s)]
*  So just like you buy a washer and dryer, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1644.84s)]
*  before you buy it, you don't look whether the door [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1647.08s)]
*  is big enough for it to come through the door. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1649.1599999999999s)]
*  You just know it's big enough [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1652.0s)]
*  because society has engineered standards. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1652.96s)]
*  Or you buy a car, it's like, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1655.44s)]
*  can you get out the measuring tape, honey? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1656.8s)]
*  Will it fit in the garage? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1658.44s)]
*  Will it fit in the lanes? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1659.48s)]
*  It would never make, yeah, yeah, this is good. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1660.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's gonna fit in the lanes. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1661.9199999999998s)]
*  Could we build according to engineer standards [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1663.36s)]
*  of what we can measure? [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1665.32s)]
*  But when we can't measure things, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1666.44s)]
*  we can't build accordingly. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1668.16s)]
*  So our brains is one thing we can't routinely measure. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1669.8400000000001s)]
*  And so I wondered if you build a brain interface [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1673.52s)]
*  to measure the human brain, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1675.48s)]
*  could we build society around our brains? [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1677.0800000000002s)]
*  And specifically around the wellness of our brains. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1680.16s)]
*  And so we built this device, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1682.28s)]
*  this wearable fMRI, it's like a bike helmet [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1684.4s)]
*  you put on your head, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1686.0800000000002s)]
*  and it's the first mass market device. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1687.0800000000002s)]
*  They've done little things with this. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1689.28s)]
*  I think the reason why phone numbers are seven digits [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1691.2s)]
*  is because we can remember up to seven numbers [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1695.28s)]
*  or something like that. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1698.32s)]
*  I think our short-term retention is up to seven numbers. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1699.16s)]
*  So they have tried to do certain things [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1701.56s)]
*  around the way our brains function. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1703.28s)]
*  We just don't understand the brain enough. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1705.16s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1707.16s)]
*  Oh, that's so interesting. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1708.0s)]
*  So you understand the brain. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1709.12s)]
*  We could be walking on the wrong side of the street. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1710.96s)]
*  Elevators could be moving too slow. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1713.52s)]
*  It could be too cold in the rooms [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1715.3999999999999s)]
*  or whatever these things are. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1717.08s)]
*  You understand the brain [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1718.48s)]
*  and how it functions at the optimal level. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1719.48s)]
*  You build society around that. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1721.08s)]
*  Yeah, what a great hack. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1722.92s)]
*  And how do you come to that even idea? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1725.1599999999999s)]
*  That- [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1727.6399999999999s)]
*  Dancing. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1728.48s)]
*  Dancing. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1729.32s)]
*  Brooklyn. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1730.1599999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1731.0s)]
*  No, it was like, again, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1731.84s)]
*  I've been obsessed with super intelligence. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1734.72s)]
*  As a species, we are at a make or break moment as a species. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1737.72s)]
*  We either are gonna win big [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1743.8s)]
*  or we're gonna probably annihilate ourselves. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1746.2s)]
*  Do you have examples of how our brain is out of sync [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1748.6s)]
*  with how society is built? [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1750.76s)]
*  What happened to you? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1752.1599999999999s)]
*  Where were you where your personal brain [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1753.08s)]
*  was out of sync with society and you're like, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1755.36s)]
*  this is a problem that needs to be solved. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1757.32s)]
*  What is that moment? [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1759.56s)]
*  Because that seems to be the catalyst [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1760.4s)]
*  for the company, right? [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1761.4s)]
*  Yeah, so it's... [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1762.48s)]
*  So science begins with counting. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1765.84s)]
*  When you can count a phenomena, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1770.48s)]
*  you can engineer it with precision [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1773.24s)]
*  and we can't count our brain. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1776.72s)]
*  And so for example, like I was, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1779.2s)]
*  when we built kernel, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1781.2s)]
*  we were trying to find things we could do [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1782.08s)]
*  to make this intuitive. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1783.24s)]
*  I thought I'm gonna do psychedelics with ketamine. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1784.68s)]
*  They were gonna use ketamine, which is not a psychedelic. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1788.3999999999999s)]
*  Ketamine is like anesthesia, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1790.12s)]
*  you use it for surgery or whatever, horse tranquilizer. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1792.0s)]
*  So I did ketamine with this brain interface. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1794.28s)]
*  And so the question is, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1797.44s)]
*  people are using ketamine for the treatment of depression. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1798.6399999999999s)]
*  It's also used for a party drug, et cetera. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1800.8799999999999s)]
*  And I wanted to pose this question, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1803.56s)]
*  what happens to someone's brain when you take ketamine? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1804.76s)]
*  Because right now you take it and people are like, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1808.92s)]
*  how did you feel? [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1810.52s)]
*  What did you experience? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1811.3600000000001s)]
*  And like, well, I was in a different dimension or whatever, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1812.28s)]
*  but we don't have numbers to explain it. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1814.48s)]
*  And so if you're trying to use it [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1816.56s)]
*  for the treatment of depression or any other condition, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1817.68s)]
*  having a quantified framework really helps. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1819.88s)]
*  Or is this drug going to work for depression? [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1822.4s)]
*  Or is this drug going to work for anxiety? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1824.64s)]
*  Or like all the thousands of questions [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1827.04s)]
*  we have about our brains, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1829.84s)]
*  what does this diet do? [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1831.64s)]
*  What does exercise do? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1832.68s)]
*  What do my friends do to my brain? [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1833.6s)]
*  What does social media exposure? [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1835.16s)]
*  What does, and I fill it in with a thousand questions. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1836.88s)]
*  And I wanted to provide a easy low cost path [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1839.84s)]
*  where we could pose all these questions [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1842.24s)]
*  and then connect it with AI, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1843.8s)]
*  where now you've got this closed loop experience. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1846.36s)]
*  Like imagine before you go to bed, you're like, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1848.72s)]
*  hey AI, help me get ready for bed. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1851.08s)]
*  And you have AI, like a few thousand sounds, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1854.1599999999999s)]
*  a few thousand images, you know, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1856.2s)]
*  and you just can't. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1859.04s)]
*  Access to your air conditioning. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1859.8799999999999s)]
*  Everything. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1861.04s)]
*  Your shades in your apartment. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1861.9199999999998s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1863.76s)]
*  The music that can make you go, oh my God. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1864.6s)]
*  And give it real time, like use the Sora, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1867.48s)]
*  you know, OpenAI's new video generator. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1870.08s)]
*  Play whatever show. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1872.1200000000001s)]
*  And be like, help me get ready for bed. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1873.4s)]
*  Or help me get ready for this conversation [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1875.68s)]
*  where I'm gonna have a hard conversation with a friend. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1878.4s)]
*  And you're also feeding that AI [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1880.8s)]
*  your biological data in real time. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1882.44s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1885.08s)]
*  So it's adjusting according to your biological data. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1885.92s)]
*  As you get deeper into sleep, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1888.3600000000001s)]
*  maybe the volume slowly starts to decrease. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1889.72s)]
*  Whoa. Within milliseconds. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1892.88s)]
*  So your house is like a living organism [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1894.24s)]
*  that's reacting to you. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1896.44s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1897.72s)]
*  In an extension of you. Exactly. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1898.56s)]
*  This is the fusion of all intelligence. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1899.52s)]
*  This is what I'm talking about. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1903.24s)]
*  That's why Don't Die matters. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1904.0800000000002s)]
*  It's not just about you, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1905.48s)]
*  but it's about our entire organisms as species. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1907.16s)]
*  We're all fused. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1910.56s)]
*  Don't look at your house as just this shelter. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1911.4s)]
*  Look at your house as an extension of you. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1913.1200000000001s)]
*  This is, oh yeah, it's, I mean, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1914.96s)]
*  not to be critical of it, but like, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1917.52s)]
*  if you're looking at Neuralink [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1920.52s)]
*  as just putting the chip in your brain [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1922.28s)]
*  to change that thing in your brain, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1924.0s)]
*  it doesn't solve the things [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1925.48s)]
*  that your brain is reacting to in your world. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1926.88s)]
*  But if everything in your world [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1929.32s)]
*  is not only an extension of you and other people, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1930.88s)]
*  it's almost how the cells in your body work. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1933.8s)]
*  Aren't they constantly reacting to one another? [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1937.32s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1940.8s)]
*  So now it's kind of like an internet of things. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1941.64s)]
*  Yeah, we're one organism. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1942.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1944.2s)]
*  Is that? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1945.04s)]
*  We're linked. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1945.8600000000001s)]
*  Yes. Yes. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1946.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1947.64s)]
*  Are you familiar with this idea of transhumanism? [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1948.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1950.4s)]
*  Would you consider yourself a transhumanist? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1951.24s)]
*  I've avoided saying yes to any frame [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1953.6s)]
*  to avoid adopting frameworks I may not be familiar with. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1957.6399999999999s)]
*  Like I'm not entirely sure how people understand that word. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1963.12s)]
*  So like, for example, when I started doing this, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1966.2s)]
*  people were like, hey, this is a tech bro or a biohacker. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1967.42s)]
*  And I said, actually none of those things. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1970.68s)]
*  I'm a rejuvenation athlete. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1972.76s)]
*  Because people would look at me, they'd say, he's nuts. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1974.84s)]
*  He's weird, he's eccentric. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1976.8799999999999s)]
*  But then you look at LeBron James [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1978.6s)]
*  and no one's like, LeBron, that's stupid, man. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1980.0s)]
*  You're going to bed on time. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1981.6s)]
*  You're eating well. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1983.6399999999999s)]
*  You both spend the same amount on your body. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1984.48s)]
*  We do. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1985.76s)]
*  I'm eccentric and weird and he's amazing. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1986.6s)]
*  So just reframe it. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1989.6399999999999s)]
*  I'm an athlete. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1990.6s)]
*  I'm a professional rejuvenation athlete. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1991.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that is true. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1993.6399999999999s)]
*  Because you can get the negative connotation [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1994.48s)]
*  that goes with some of those framings. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1995.84s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1997.28s)]
*  Okay, so back to this. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1998.1s)]
*  So each apparatus in your house becomes this extension [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=1999.76s)]
*  of you and helps optimize you, right? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2004.3999999999999s)]
*  Is that the idea behind this? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2007.32s)]
*  But in order to do that, you need to know exactly [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2008.54s)]
*  how your brain is reacting to all these stimuli. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2011.68s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2014.24s)]
*  And have you been able to map the brain's reaction? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2015.0800000000002s)]
*  We've done, yeah, we've done a lot of emotion work. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2018.2s)]
*  This was Inquest, what was the name of this company? [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2020.1200000000001s)]
*  Colonel. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2023.72s)]
*  Oh, this is Colonel. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2024.5600000000002s)]
*  Yes, it's Colonel. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2025.4s)]
*  Okay, there was another one that you, doesn't matter. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2026.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2027.76s)]
*  Okay, Colonel, got it. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2028.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2029.44s)]
*  Yeah, we looked at emotions. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2030.3200000000002s)]
*  We've looked at brain age and respond. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2031.3200000000002s)]
*  We've looked at cognitive decline. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2034.92s)]
*  We did a study around alcohol, for example, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2036.76s)]
*  where we had a placebo low and high level of alcohol. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2039.0s)]
*  And when someone is at the low level of alcohol, [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2042.96s)]
*  they become impaired, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2048.2s)]
*  but the brain compensates for the impairment. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2049.64s)]
*  So if you do a behavioral test, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2051.64s)]
*  you can't tell they're impaired. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2053.24s)]
*  But if you do, they put the Colonel device on, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2055.8s)]
*  you can see they're impaired. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2057.96s)]
*  And this is what happens to cognitive decline, [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2059.52s)]
*  that people start losing their minds for decades, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2061.56s)]
*  but the mind compensates for it. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2066.32s)]
*  And then it manifests when the brain can no longer do it, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2068.24s)]
*  which we saw in the high level of alcohol, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2070.64s)]
*  where the brain became so impaired, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2072.4799999999996s)]
*  the brain couldn't compensate for it. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2074.2s)]
*  And so Colonel could show a mild cognitive impairment [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2076.4799999999996s)]
*  long before you start showing symptoms, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2080.12s)]
*  then you could do something about it. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2082.72s)]
*  So these are the things, like it sits invisible, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2084.16s)]
*  but it's really important to know [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2085.9599999999996s)]
*  if you're starting to lose your mind, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2087.52s)]
*  you don't wanna wait and find out later on in life. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2088.8799999999997s)]
*  It's only invisible because we're not measuring it effectively. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2090.9199999999996s)]
*  Exactly, that's why science begins with counting. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2092.52s)]
*  You need to have the data, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2094.8399999999997s)]
*  otherwise you just don't know what's going on. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2096.24s)]
*  And is this successful, is this functioning right now? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2099.04s)]
*  It is, yeah, it's in clinical trials [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2102.64s)]
*  for both depression and mild cognitive impairment. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2104.72s)]
*  My dad has MCI. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2109.24s)]
*  So did my dad. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2111.3599999999997s)]
*  Really? [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2112.2s)]
*  Did he have, did it develop into Alzheimer's? [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2113.02s)]
*  No, still early stages. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2116.3999999999996s)]
*  Early stages. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2118.04s)]
*  Does he have the amyloid plaque buildup? [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2119.08s)]
*  We haven't had it tested yet. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2121.64s)]
*  Got you. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2123.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, this is my stepfather, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2124.2s)]
*  pretty resistant to a lot of these things. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2125.04s)]
*  Doing much about it, yeah. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2127.48s)]
*  Yeah, it gets tricky, and also as the disease worsens, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2128.48s)]
*  they become increasingly more resistant. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2131.84s)]
*  But yeah, it's really interesting how. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2135.4s)]
*  So this is like the equivalent [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2137.92s)]
*  to people getting full body MRI scans [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2139.12s)]
*  to try to catch cancer before it even comes up. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2141.92s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2144.04s)]
*  Exactly right. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2144.88s)]
*  Is the brain more difficult to reverse aging [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2145.72s)]
*  or prevent decay than other organs in the body? [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2147.48s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2150.68s)]
*  Each organ has its own opportunities and challenges. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2152.36s)]
*  I mean, for example, one thing, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2158.2400000000002s)]
*  I reduced my brain age on one marker by nine years. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2160.2400000000002s)]
*  And so I, it's called white matter hyperintensities. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2164.28s)]
*  And it's like, think of it kind of like [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2168.32s)]
*  a scar tissue a little bit. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2170.32s)]
*  I had it in large part because I had bad posture. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2171.88s)]
*  I read this up on your, yeah. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2176.44s)]
*  And so I did an MRI. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2177.76s)]
*  I know it's a little uncomfortable, right? [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2179.52s)]
*  But it's like a very specific posture [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2181.32s)]
*  that you had defined, right? [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2182.92s)]
*  Yeah, so I did this MRI. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2183.84s)]
*  I found that my internal jugular veins, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2185.1200000000003s)]
*  these pipes on the side of the neck, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2187.6400000000003s)]
*  who they come from the brain out, they allow blood flow. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2189.04s)]
*  Mine are congenitally small, narrow. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2192.76s)]
*  So my posture, which has probably like this, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2195.84s)]
*  further made those veins unable to have. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2198.0800000000004s)]
*  Restricted those veins. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2201.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2201.88s)]
*  So you're not getting the blood flow that you need. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2202.7000000000003s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2203.54s)]
*  So we measured it with ultrasound, with MRI, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2204.38s)]
*  and then I started working on, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2206.28s)]
*  that's why I worked on posture so hard, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2207.1200000000003s)]
*  to optimize for blood flow in and out of the brain. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2209.0800000000004s)]
*  And we measured this, and when I did that, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2211.92s)]
*  it reduced my brain age on this marker by nine years. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2214.4s)]
*  Wow. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2217.6s)]
*  Did you feel immediate difference in cognitive ability? [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2218.44s)]
*  I did. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2222.2799999999997s)]
*  And how did that manifest? [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2223.12s)]
*  I had a lot of residual brain fog, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2225.12s)]
*  and I didn't know it was fog. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2227.92s)]
*  You drink some coffee, or you do some sort of upper [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2230.08s)]
*  to kind of push through it, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2233.06s)]
*  but in reality, it's just your brain's dying. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2234.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2236.24s)]
*  You have no blood getting there. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2237.08s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2237.92s)]
*  Wow. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2238.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm curious, and of course, going the natural way is best, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2239.64s)]
*  but did you ever consider getting surgery, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2242.7999999999997s)]
*  like putting a stent to just increase blood flow? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2245.56s)]
*  Yeah, I'm open to it. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2249.24s)]
*  So, stents haven't worked. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2250.52s)]
*  There's another surgery where they, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2252.4s)]
*  it's really a risky surgery, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2253.72s)]
*  because they go in, they slice you up on the neck, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2255.12s)]
*  there's all these delicate muscles, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2257.6s)]
*  and so basically no one has a surgery to fix this. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2259.48s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2262.88s)]
*  I was open to it, but yeah. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2264.44s)]
*  How many people do you think have this same type of thing, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2265.72s)]
*  where they're not getting reduced blood flow? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2268.36s)]
*  Thousands of people have emailed me, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2270.0s)]
*  being like, oh my God, I have been trying to solve this [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2272.08s)]
*  for a decade, and no one has given me answers. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2275.28s)]
*  I've looked into it, and I've got it too. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2278.2000000000003s)]
*  So, it's more common than people think. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2279.6800000000003s)]
*  It hasn't been given a language. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2282.08s)]
*  It's a very esoteric area of medicine. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2283.2000000000003s)]
*  Have you ever experienced stress-related [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2287.04s)]
*  breathing difficulties? [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2290.48s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2293.04s)]
*  Almost like a hyperventilation state due to stress? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2293.88s)]
*  Never heard anything about this. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2298.6s)]
*  I mean, I personally haven't experienced it. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2300.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2302.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2303.4s)]
*  Well, there goes my question. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2304.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2305.88s)]
*  I have a... [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2306.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, how did you fix your posture? [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2307.56s)]
*  I got a, so I found a specialist who is, [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2311.84s)]
*  a specialist in this given area, and he taught me, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2317.48s)]
*  and so the easiest way to think about it [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2321.08s)]
*  is imagine you have a string right above your head, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2323.1600000000003s)]
*  and you pull it straight up. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2325.92s)]
*  And to build these muscles, it takes about six months. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2328.6s)]
*  You can already, like, you don't even feel yourself, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2332.04s)]
*  like, tired. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2333.56s)]
*  And so, you have to, every day for the first few months, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2335.04s)]
*  you probably have to remind yourself 200 times. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2338.1600000000003s)]
*  It's constant. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2341.2400000000002s)]
*  And then, now it just becomes habitual. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2342.56s)]
*  But then, in my family, we have a culture of posture. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2345.1200000000003s)]
*  So, my son was like, Dad's like an AI. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2347.76s)]
*  He's like this. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2350.04s)]
*  Zip, zip, zip. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2350.88s)]
*  And so, now, every time anyone in the family hears, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2351.7200000000003s)]
*  zup, everyone in the family, straight up. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2355.44s)]
*  Pops, right up. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2357.72s)]
*  Pops. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2358.72s)]
*  And it's just a nice thing for all of us to do, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2359.56s)]
*  because it's so easy to be like, you know, [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2361.0s)]
*  on your phone, or like, typing. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2362.9199999999996s)]
*  And so, just a cultural thing now we have in the family. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2365.6s)]
*  Do you think, like, homo sapiens earlier had better posture? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2367.8399999999997s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2373.12s)]
*  Like, I'm curious how, like, the historic precedent [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2374.4399999999996s)]
*  for human beings, like, I wonder if you feel like [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2377.08s)]
*  you're at odds with our evolutionary past. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2378.9599999999996s)]
*  Like, are you trying to resist our animal nature [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2381.3599999999997s)]
*  that we came from, or are you trying to embrace [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2383.3599999999997s)]
*  and return to those elements? [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2385.3599999999997s)]
*  Like, better posture, you know, exercise, things like that. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2386.6s)]
*  Yeah, this is, I think, a, this is a topic [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2389.72s)]
*  a lot of people are interested in. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2393.52s)]
*  A lot of people make the argument, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2395.2s)]
*  if it's time tested over a certain duration of time, [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2396.7999999999997s)]
*  there's some credibility to it, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2399.68s)]
*  and the new modern science methods [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2401.04s)]
*  still have to prove themselves. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2403.92s)]
*  I really side on the science and counting part. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2406.7599999999998s)]
*  If I can measure it, now I believe it. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2410.72s)]
*  I don't give a default position of strength [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2413.08s)]
*  that just because something's been around [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2415.6s)]
*  for some duration of time, that it has, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2417.08s)]
*  it's in the correct position. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2420.56s)]
*  I have a question. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2423.16s)]
*  You left Mormonism, your faith. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2424.0s)]
*  What's your relationship with God? [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2425.92s)]
*  I think it's one of the most beautiful ironies [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2429.36s)]
*  of our existence. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2432.96s)]
*  I mean, the universe is irony, ultimately, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2434.72s)]
*  every time you look at this, and so the story has been [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2436.6s)]
*  God created man, and now we're doing this thing. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2440.56s)]
*  If you look at the stories all religions tell, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2445.88s)]
*  it's typically that same tale. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2447.56s)]
*  I think the truth is evolution created man, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2449.2s)]
*  and man's gonna create God. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2453.52s)]
*  Or we will become God, or something like that. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2456.96s)]
*  Because as a religious person, I think most faiths [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2459.56s)]
*  kind of say we all have God within us, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2462.48s)]
*  but then also they say kind of the goal of life [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2465.6s)]
*  is to break free of the life cycle, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2468.7999999999997s)]
*  whether it's heaven and hell, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2470.24s)]
*  whether it's breaking reincarnation. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2471.2s)]
*  So as a religious person, it's interesting to hear, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2473.0s)]
*  part of me really agrees with what you're saying. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2477.6s)]
*  Yeah, we all have the ability to be God, right? [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2479.64s)]
*  You could solve humanity like God would, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2481.52s)]
*  make a utopia like God would. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2484.16s)]
*  And then part of me is very unsettled by this idea [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2485.64s)]
*  of living forever and never, essentially, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2488.44s)]
*  rejecting the goals of all religions. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2491.72s)]
*  Yeah, this is such a delicious conversation, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2493.56s)]
*  because I remember in Mormonism, [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2498.6s)]
*  where your delicious is great. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2501.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2504.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2505.8s)]
*  It made me feel good about myself. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2506.6400000000003s)]
*  It was great. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2509.48s)]
*  It made me feel great, to be honest with you. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2510.32s)]
*  You ain't calling out your conversations [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2512.48s)]
*  or religious, ugly. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2513.76s)]
*  Okay, but go on, go on, go on. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2515.32s)]
*  I mean, I was told, you have these rules to obey, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2517.32s)]
*  and if you obey these rules, you get the prize. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2524.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and the prize is an afterlife. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2526.44s)]
*  So the only thing you care about. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2528.6s)]
*  You made a few hundred million, you're like, I got it. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2530.96s)]
*  I'll take it from here. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2532.96s)]
*  So if the world burns around you, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2538.16s)]
*  not only do you not care, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2543.44s)]
*  you see it as fulfillment of scripture. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2545.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2547.2799999999997s)]
*  Great, things are going according to plan. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2550.04s)]
*  I have no responsibility to fix the world. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2553.36s)]
*  I have no responsibility. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2556.12s)]
*  This is great. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2557.2799999999997s)]
*  Things are going really well. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2559.36s)]
*  So my only responsibility is to play the rules of the system. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2560.2s)]
*  And that really poses a very serious question [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2563.96s)]
*  because we can be respectful of all ideas, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2566.4s)]
*  and then there's a very practical moment where we say, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2571.0s)]
*  we may all die, and maybe we think we have this safety net [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2575.44s)]
*  where we're gonna get the asap afterlife, maybe we don't, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2579.36s)]
*  but it creates a real fracture in the species. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2581.8s)]
*  And so this is what I guess why I come back to don't die [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2586.04s)]
*  is the most played game on planet earth every day, [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2588.64s)]
*  every second of every day is don't die. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2594.04s)]
*  We all breathe every few seconds to not die. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2596.44s)]
*  If something happened in this room and we felt threatened, [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2599.36s)]
*  we would leave this room because we don't wanna die. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2602.36s)]
*  It's our number one priority, more so than this conversation. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2604.44s)]
*  And so every human on the planet, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2608.16s)]
*  every second of every day plays don't die. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2610.16s)]
*  Now you take one step above don't die, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2612.56s)]
*  and we fracture into a billion different games. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2616.8s)]
*  We care about different things every moment of every day. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2619.12s)]
*  And so if we have to say as a species, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2621.84s)]
*  if we have to align ourselves around one thing, don't die. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2623.56s)]
*  And so in that way, I think every religious group [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2627.92s)]
*  could come together and say- [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2630.12s)]
*  This is a new faith, don't die. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2630.96s)]
*  I mean, it's already our faith. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2632.76s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2634.52s)]
*  It's already the faith, it's already, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2636.08s)]
*  it's played more than capitalism, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2637.56s)]
*  it's played more than anything in existence. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2638.84s)]
*  And now like- [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2640.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm not saying this to argue as if I'm right, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2641.52s)]
*  but there is a difference, [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2643.4s)]
*  that it's a don't die for that finite amount of time. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2644.44s)]
*  You wanna extend it, [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2647.2400000000002s)]
*  but the idea of living forever is different than- [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2648.4s)]
*  But given the opportunity to live forever, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2650.52s)]
*  who's saying no to it? [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2655.04s)]
*  But see, the thing is on don't live forever, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2656.92s)]
*  it breaks the human brain. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2658.76s)]
*  On don't live forever? [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2661.84s)]
*  On living forever. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2663.2400000000002s)]
*  On living forever. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2664.08s)]
*  On living forever, we cannot understand [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2664.92s)]
*  what it means to live forever, so you say those words- [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2666.28s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if I want that. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2667.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2669.12s)]
*  As you're saying. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2669.96s)]
*  Don't die is more digestible than live forever. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2670.78s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2672.56s)]
*  I have a belief that we will live forever. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2673.4s)]
*  As a religious person, you have this idea [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2675.2000000000003s)]
*  that our consciousness and our soul will prolong. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2677.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2679.48s)]
*  Have you read Denial of Death? [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2680.32s)]
*  Are you familiar with this book? [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2681.56s)]
*  I'm familiar with the book, I'm writing it. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2682.4s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2683.36s)]
*  It's basically this idea that kind of like [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2684.36s)]
*  brings together all these different philosophers' ideas [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2686.64s)]
*  of this exact principle, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2688.52s)]
*  that the ambient philosophy of all living things [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2690.04s)]
*  is don't die. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2692.56s)]
*  Don't die. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2693.4s)]
*  And that all things that we do, even stand-up comedy, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2694.2400000000002s)]
*  like the approval of other people, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2696.2000000000003s)]
*  is to not get rejected by the in-group [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2698.0s)]
*  to then prolong our existence. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2699.6800000000003s)]
*  And yeah, I just think at that point, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2701.76s)]
*  even if you're a religious person, [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2705.36s)]
*  you still believe that you will live forever. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2706.32s)]
*  So it's kind of already baked into us. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2708.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2710.36s)]
*  So it's actually, don't die is the ultimate [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2711.36s)]
*  cooperation game, because everybody can have [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2713.6400000000003s)]
*  their various beliefs. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2716.92s)]
*  Yeah, and still opt in. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2718.0400000000004s)]
*  And it's totally cool. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2718.88s)]
*  Everyone's cool, we're all gonna cooperate together. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2720.7200000000003s)]
*  You were right, this is delicious, dude. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2722.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2724.48s)]
*  I thought delicious conversation started. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2725.32s)]
*  Yeah, me. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2727.36s)]
*  Yeah, I guess I still, I don't fully agree with that, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2728.2000000000003s)]
*  because I do think in religion, again, in the end, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2731.0s)]
*  eventually, I don't think a lot of religious people [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2733.36s)]
*  wanna live forever. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2735.72s)]
*  I just, I don't, as it is now in this moment. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2736.8s)]
*  Your religion is the most run it back. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2740.24s)]
*  Run it back, and then the goal is [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2742.68s)]
*  to break free of the life cycle. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2744.72s)]
*  But what is nirvana? [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2745.76s)]
*  Breaking free of the life cycle. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2747.04s)]
*  Moksha is living forever. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2748.4s)]
*  That's the afterlife. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2749.76s)]
*  But it is freedom from desire, essentially, [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2751.8s)]
*  all desire, I'm free of. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2755.84s)]
*  And that's when you reach moksha, [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2757.56s)]
*  which is usually when you break the life cycle. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2758.6s)]
*  But that is, again. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2760.64s)]
*  But how long do you exist in moksha for? [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2761.64s)]
*  That's eternity, that's your soul. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2764.2799999999997s)]
*  So yeah, we're already on board. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2765.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2767.92s)]
*  The thing is, though, we don't. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2768.7599999999998s)]
*  Brian's just trying to make moksha here. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2770.56s)]
*  Really. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2771.8399999999997s)]
*  You understand the difference between the paradise [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2772.68s)]
*  and then just, yeah. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2775.2s)]
*  It's getting less delicious, I'll be honest with you. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2777.08s)]
*  The elegance of this argument, though, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2779.7999999999997s)]
*  is we don't need to grapple with. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2781.3599999999997s)]
*  See the elegance, it's not delicious, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2784.6s)]
*  but it's elegant. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2785.96s)]
*  This guy's so good, he's so good. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2786.7999999999997s)]
*  He's a concept artist. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2787.64s)]
*  Okay, go. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2788.48s)]
*  Don't die. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2789.3199999999997s)]
*  And tomorrow, wanting tomorrow is the same [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2790.72s)]
*  as living forever. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2794.68s)]
*  There identical concept. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2796.24s)]
*  You just wanna keep on wanting tomorrow, yes. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2797.08s)]
*  We care about tomorrow, that's it. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2799.68s)]
*  Now, we can build reality based upon caring about tomorrow. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2803.2s)]
*  And we all can have our own imaginations [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2806.8799999999997s)]
*  on what exists beyond tomorrow, fine. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2809.12s)]
*  We all want tomorrow. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2811.2799999999997s)]
*  And that's, if we wanna bind ourselves together, [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2812.8399999999997s)]
*  we can then crush all the things that divide us [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2815.7999999999997s)]
*  into the we care about tomorrow, let's not die today. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2819.2s)]
*  And we just do that for some unknown duration of time. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2822.12s)]
*  Hi, everybody, I'm wearing something different now [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2825.0s)]
*  while we're sitting with somebody [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2827.48s)]
*  who is clearly optimizing his performance with the PEDs, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2828.7599999999998s)]
*  with the performance enhancing drugs. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2833.7999999999997s)]
*  I think it's a perfect transition to talk to other people [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2835.12s)]
*  who definitely should be using performance enhancing drugs [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2837.9199999999996s)]
*  and those are athletes. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2840.64s)]
*  And I just wanna say that Jamil lost us a million dollars. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2841.6s)]
*  I, listen, he did lose us a million dollars. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2847.36s)]
*  He did lose us a million dollars. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2850.2799999999997s)]
*  We could have won a million dollars. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2851.4s)]
*  And I think we hit everything except Clyde Hilaire. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2853.0s)]
*  Edwards Hilaire, he bet on Clyde Edwards Hilaire? [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2857.44s)]
*  To get a touchdown. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2859.7999999999997s)]
*  I thought it was. What is he doing? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2860.68s)]
*  And I asked him, I was like, [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2862.36s)]
*  listen, there's a lot of money on the line here. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2863.2s)]
*  Why don't you call up a professional buddy of yours [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2864.7599999999998s)]
*  who knows how to gamble and just pick the best ones [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2867.12s)]
*  and we could make some fucking money. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2869.68s)]
*  I didn't even see this guy enter the game. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2871.52s)]
*  No, he doesn't play. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2873.24s)]
*  Isaiah Pacheco plays there. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2874.4s)]
*  He's running seventh round running back. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2876.64s)]
*  This guy Edwards Hilaire was a first round pick. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2878.04s)]
*  God bless, he does make plays sometimes, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2879.8799999999997s)]
*  but he got benched for a seventh round pick [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2882.96s)]
*  or whatever he was, Isaiah Pacheco. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2885.04s)]
*  He might have even been drafted, I don't know. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2886.16s)]
*  But, that was just, that was. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2887.7599999999998s)]
*  Because as the game, I mean, when it went to overtime, [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2891.2s)]
*  I was like, oh, we absolutely got this. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2895.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2898.16s)]
*  And I think that we hit every other marker. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2899.08s)]
*  You guys can tell me if we did or not. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2900.8799999999997s)]
*  But anyway, shout out surprise picks. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2902.16s)]
*  You gotta wait clean on this one, [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2903.7599999999998s)]
*  but the next one I'm on that ass. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2904.96s)]
*  Okay? [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2907.04s)]
*  Oh, but you can still do NBA. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2907.88s)]
*  I'm putting prize picks in today. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2908.7s)]
*  All right, what do you got? [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2909.88s)]
*  I got Jacob Poodle. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2910.7200000000003s)]
*  They're playing the Nets who just fired their head coach. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2911.54s)]
*  So, I think he'll get less than 12 and a half points [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2913.88s)]
*  and I think Kale Bridges will get more than 23 and a half. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2915.9s)]
*  Okay. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2918.2s)]
*  Those are my prize picks for today. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2919.02s)]
*  But you can play all year, is the point. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2920.2400000000002s)]
*  Yo, go to prizepicks.com, man, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2921.88s)]

*  and they're gonna match your initial deposit bonus [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2926.48s)]
*  up to $100, okay? [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2928.2s)]
*  It's the easiest fucking thing on the planet. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2929.8s)]
*  I genuinely mean this. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2933.0s)]
*  They're gonna give you these situations [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2934.32s)]
*  where you basically choose more or less. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2937.32s)]
*  With basketball, more or less rebounds. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2939.28s)]
*  They're gonna put it out there. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2941.48s)]
*  You choose more or less. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2942.44s)]
*  And you know fantasy, you gotta set your line up. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2944.4s)]
*  It's too much. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2946.84s)]
*  It's too much of an effort. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2947.6800000000003s)]
*  You can play this wherever you want to. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2948.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's incredible. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2949.48s)]
*  Anyway, prizepicks.com, shout out to y'all. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2950.44s)]
*  Let's get back to the show. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2953.32s)]
*  Okay, so what's this future gonna look like [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2954.76s)]
*  next maybe 10, 20 years? [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2956.56s)]
*  I feel like you have an idea where we're gonna go. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2957.88s)]
*  Yeah, great question. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2959.4s)]
*  What are the innovations that we're gonna see? [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2960.48s)]
*  It's delicious. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2962.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2963.56s)]
*  So there's a... [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2964.64s)]
*  Thank you, dude. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2965.48s)]
*  That means a lot. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2966.32s)]
*  That means a lot. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2967.16s)]
*  Really fucking does. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2968.0s)]
*  I'm a taste maker. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2969.8s)]
*  I'm gonna break some timbre on that question. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2970.64s)]
*  That's a thank you. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2972.44s)]
*  Okay, what is it? [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2975.0s)]
*  Next 10, 20, what are we gonna see? [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2976.64s)]
*  So I think there's, instead of predicting [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2978.2s)]
*  the actual thing, I'm gonna tell you how to think about it. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2981.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2982.64s)]
*  Okay, actually, do you wanna play a game? [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2985.6s)]
*  It'll take a few minutes to play this game. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2988.2s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2989.92s)]
*  Okay, we're gonna speed. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2990.96s)]
*  Does Alex get naked? [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2991.8s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2992.64s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2993.48s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2994.3199999999997s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2995.16s)]
*  Okay, so we're gonna speed through this. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2996.0s)]
*  This is basically a very abbreviated version [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=2998.3599999999997s)]
*  of I've been hosting these dinners at my house [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3000.72s)]
*  about the future of being human. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3003.3199999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3004.68s)]
*  And I bring together 10 or 12 people, [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3005.52s)]
*  and it's a two and a half hour long conversation. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3007.8399999999997s)]
*  People will dip into existential crisis [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3011.72s)]
*  multiple times and come back up. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3013.96s)]
*  At the end, we typically find ourselves hugging [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3015.12s)]
*  and, you know, want to hang out again. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3016.92s)]
*  So we're gonna do a very quick one. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3019.7999999999997s)]
*  We're gonna hang out again. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3021.12s)]
*  So we're gonna do a very compressed version. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3022.08s)]
*  Yeah, take your time. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3023.48s)]
*  There's no rush on this. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3024.6s)]
*  All right, so first question. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3025.44s)]
*  If you had access to an algorithm [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3027.68s)]
*  that could give you the best physical, mental, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3029.7599999999998s)]
*  and spiritual health of your life, [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3031.7999999999997s)]
*  but in exchange for achieving that, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3035.16s)]
*  you had to do what the algorithm said. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3036.6s)]
*  So go to bed on time, go to bed when it said, [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3038.52s)]
*  eat what it said, so on and so forth. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3040.3199999999997s)]
*  Let's just keep it to health and wellness stuff. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3042.0s)]
*  Like your mind is still doing its own thing, okay? [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3044.08s)]
*  Do you say yes to the algorithm, or do you say no? [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3046.92s)]
*  And again, give me it one more time. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3050.48s)]
*  So the algorithm is you have access. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3051.64s)]
*  You have access to an algorithm [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3053.8399999999997s)]
*  that gives you the best physical, spiritual, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3055.04s)]
*  emotional health of your entire life. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3058.52s)]
*  You've never been better as a human. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3061.4s)]
*  But in exchange for that, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3064.68s)]
*  you're doing what the algorithm says. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3065.7599999999998s)]
*  Do you say yes to that, or do you say no to that? [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3067.52s)]
*  Well, I say no, probably. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3069.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3071.2799999999997s)]
*  I want to say I'd say yes. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3072.12s)]
*  I probably wouldn't even stick to it if I did. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3073.04s)]
*  I say no so fast it's not even fair. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3074.24s)]
*  Yeah, because I'm happy in doing the things that I'm doing. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3077.04s)]
*  Like I'm not necessarily seeking more happiness. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3081.68s)]
*  If I was coming from like a really deep and dark place, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3085.0s)]
*  maybe I would look for the salvation there. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3087.44s)]
*  But I'm like really happy and really fulfilled, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3089.2400000000002s)]
*  and I really love what's going on. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3090.92s)]
*  And I love the freedom that I have. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3092.4s)]
*  And freedom is the most important thing for me. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3094.2s)]
*  Under the hypothetical, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3096.56s)]
*  can you reject what the algorithm is suggesting? [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3097.4s)]
*  No, you can't get that. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3099.56s)]
*  For me, freedom is over everything. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3101.04s)]
*  Like the only reason I want money [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3102.92s)]
*  is to have the freedom to do exactly what I want to do [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3104.12s)]
*  whenever I want to do it. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3106.12s)]
*  Unfortunately, I'd probably say no. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3106.96s)]
*  Yeah, I need freedom. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3108.3599999999997s)]
*  If you must accept it, then I would say no. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3109.44s)]
*  Yeah, if you must accept it is a hard no. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3111.2s)]
*  Then I can't, I'm not free. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3112.92s)]
*  If you can reject it, [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3113.7599999999998s)]
*  then I would be curious to know what the algorithm thinks. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3114.6s)]
*  I need the freedom, Brian. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3115.72s)]
*  It's gotta be a no. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3119.88s)]
*  Yeah, so four nos. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3121.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3122.44s)]
*  But I feel like this is the setup. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3123.2799999999997s)]
*  This is the beginning. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3124.12s)]
*  Step one, baby. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3124.96s)]
*  Don't worry about it. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3126.2799999999997s)]
*  Step one. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3127.12s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3127.96s)]
*  I want to say yes. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3128.7999999999997s)]
*  Do you want to see your parents again? [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3130.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3132.48s)]
*  Okay, okay, go on. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3133.3199999999997s)]
*  All right, now the next turn. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3134.16s)]
*  I want my mom to do it. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3136.16s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3137.0s)]
*  You want everyone else in your life to be healthy, happy, [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3137.8399999999997s)]
*  but you want to do Molly. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3140.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3142.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3143.24s)]
*  All right, next turn of the conversation. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3144.16s)]
*  Let's now be an anthropologist. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3146.7599999999998s)]
*  We're going to imagine ourselves transported in time [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3149.68s)]
*  to the 25th century. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3152.3199999999997s)]
*  We're observing this conversation right now, [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3153.8399999999997s)]
*  and we are trying to assess what do homo sapiens value [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3156.6s)]
*  in the year 2024? [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3162.44s)]
*  What are their intellectual dispositions? [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3164.0s)]
*  What are the ethical and cultural norms? [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3166.12s)]
*  How do they understand themselves? [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3168.44s)]
*  What are the characteristics of their intelligence? [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3170.0s)]
*  What do they observe about your comments you guys just said? [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3172.2s)]
*  Autonomy, value of autonomy. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3174.68s)]
*  Yeah, I would say so. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3177.2s)]
*  Yeah, freedom and individuality. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3178.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3181.16s)]
*  And maybe a lack of foresight. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3182.44s)]
*  I think that if we're at this time [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3185.4s)]
*  where they're living forever, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3187.32s)]
*  and we're essentially choosing not to live forever. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3189.08s)]
*  And not be as happy. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3191.92s)]
*  And not maybe be as happy, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3193.24s)]
*  but maybe we don't know what that happiness is, [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3194.56s)]
*  and maybe we're happy right now, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3196.52s)]
*  so it's not anything that we're essentially sacrificing. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3197.6s)]
*  And maybe the restriction of these rules [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3199.8799999999997s)]
*  could reduce our happiness. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3202.08s)]
*  So we're looking at it as like a deduction. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3203.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3205.3599999999997s)]
*  But are they living forever in this hypothetical? [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3206.2s)]
*  In the 25th century? [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3210.04s)]
*  Yeah, the thought experiment that we're playing with [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3210.8799999999997s)]
*  is just the best, like the best existence you've ever had. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3213.4399999999996s)]
*  No, I'm saying 25th century people [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3216.6s)]
*  that are looking back at us. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3218.56s)]
*  Are they living forever by then? [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3219.3999999999996s)]
*  Aging is solved, yes. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3221.24s)]
*  Aging is solved, okay. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3222.24s)]
*  So they're looking back at us and they're going, [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3223.56s)]
*  wow, these idiots are throwing away, [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3225.3599999999997s)]
*  living for hundreds of years or thousands of years, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3228.3199999999997s)]
*  and experiencing love for thousands of years, [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3231.04s)]
*  experiencing kindness and camaraderie, [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3233.24s)]
*  and building these great societies, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3235.0s)]
*  so that they can eat Snickers, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3236.68s)]
*  and they could stay up until four in the morning. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3237.8799999999997s)]
*  You know what they would look at us like? [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3240.0s)]
*  The way we look at drug addicts. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3241.12s)]
*  Like you're choosing this perceived pleasure [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3243.08s)]
*  over what's actually good for you. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3245.2799999999997s)]
*  That's foolish. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3247.24s)]
*  They never did drugs though, [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3250.68s)]
*  so they don't know what they're messing with. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3251.64s)]
*  I don't know what it's like. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3253.48s)]
*  No, they don't know what that is. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3254.3199999999997s)]
*  They never danced in Brooklyn for six hours, Brian. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3256.04s)]
*  Okay, Miles, you want to say something? [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3259.72s)]
*  Would they be mad because we're not doing the things [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3261.08s)]
*  that allow them to reach this aging solve faster? [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3263.72s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3269.52s)]
*  I mean, how do you feel about people of previous centuries [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3271.36s)]
*  who did various things that stunted human progress? [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3274.08s)]
*  Probably angry, honestly. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3278.48s)]
*  Oh, we're selfish. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3280.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's my point on that. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3281.6s)]
*  Ah, that's interesting. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3282.92s)]
*  Are we mad that they're selfish? [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3283.76s)]
*  But also we're talking about a future existence [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3284.6s)]
*  where people are as perfect as they can be, [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3285.44s)]
*  so I think anger is probably a negative feeling. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3288.36s)]
*  That's also true. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3290.56s)]
*  They could have got there fast. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3291.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3292.84s)]
*  But maybe they're laughing at us. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3293.6800000000003s)]
*  But yeah, maybe if someone in the past, [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3294.52s)]
*  I don't know, maybe they're extrapolating. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3296.32s)]
*  These selfish fucks, they want to live for themselves. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3297.1600000000003s)]
*  They're mad at 17th century people [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3298.0s)]
*  for not allowing science to progress. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3299.96s)]
*  That's adorable, I think. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3301.96s)]
*  Yeah, they'll feel sorry for it. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3303.0s)]
*  It's like, damn, if they only knew. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3304.28s)]
*  Are you mad about people with pre-germ theory? [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3305.48s)]
*  I'm not mad at them. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3307.88s)]
*  It means nothing to me. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3309.3599999999997s)]
*  Even like those people that locked up Galileo, [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3311.9199999999996s)]
*  I kind of like that. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3314.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3315.56s)]
*  You need some rules. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3316.3999999999996s)]
*  You need some rules. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3318.9599999999996s)]
*  This guy's throwing everything around. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3319.7999999999997s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3321.24s)]
*  I just painted this entire mural. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3322.08s)]
*  All you do is flout the rules. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3323.9199999999996s)]
*  That's your whole thing, is flouting the rules. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3324.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I like to be Galileo, too. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3326.7999999999997s)]
*  Not everybody can be Galileo. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3329.12s)]
*  You need rules in order to flout them. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3330.6s)]
*  So we want the rules, but we want to break the rules. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3333.7999999999997s)]
*  If there's no rules, it's no fun. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3335.9599999999996s)]
*  We want to be a little dangerous. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3337.64s)]
*  Okay, let's keep going. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3338.7599999999998s)]
*  This is the first provocation. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3339.6s)]
*  You saw how ruthlessly you rejected the notion. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3343.3599999999997s)]
*  The knee-jerk reaction was just violent. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3352.8799999999997s)]
*  It was just like, get the fuck out. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3355.2799999999997s)]
*  You flip the frame and we pull in the wisdom [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3358.08s)]
*  that we know exists. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3361.04s)]
*  We look back at previous centuries [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3362.0s)]
*  and we see them as some form of primitive existence. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3363.2799999999997s)]
*  We see ourselves as more enlightened. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3366.32s)]
*  So you flip the frame and you see [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3368.1200000000003s)]
*  that we become introspective. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3369.6000000000004s)]
*  We think, well, it's interesting how we behave this way. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3370.84s)]
*  So now we're a little open-minded. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3373.6400000000003s)]
*  We're not as entirely closed as that first prompt. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3375.6400000000003s)]
*  First prompt is just like, it dunks. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3377.84s)]
*  Okay, now let's just say, in our current situation, [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3380.32s)]
*  what could possibly change, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3383.28s)]
*  or what could possibly be happening [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3385.88s)]
*  that would change the circumstances [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3388.04s)]
*  of what we think to be the case? [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3390.84s)]
*  And so if you say, all right, [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3392.88s)]
*  homo sapiens have been the dominant form of intelligence [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3394.4s)]
*  for 200,000 years. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3396.56s)]
*  As a species, we've just dominated the planet [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3397.7200000000003s)]
*  and we've done remarkable things [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3400.7200000000003s)]
*  from the atomic level to everything else. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3402.04s)]
*  We've been the custodians of information. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3405.08s)]
*  So what we learn in school, we understand things, [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3407.56s)]
*  we have shared knowledge, [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3411.12s)]
*  but we are the shared custodians of all knowledge. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3412.36s)]
*  This is primarily known [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3415.56s)]
*  as a first principles thinking perspective. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3416.6s)]
*  It's known as engineering. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3418.88s)]
*  So when you wanna build something, [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3419.76s)]
*  you want to acquire all knowledge [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3421.6s)]
*  and you want to make the fewest number of assumptions possible [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3423.92s)]
*  and then walk your way through it. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3426.52s)]
*  There's a new concept called zeroeth principle thinking. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3428.8s)]
*  And that is zeroeth. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3431.88s)]
*  Zeroeth, okay, principle thinking. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3434.36s)]
*  Is that why you're zero on Twitter? [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3435.88s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, okay, got it. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3438.92s)]
*  Yeah, I came up with this concept, [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3440.48s)]
*  zeroeth principle thinking. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3441.6400000000003s)]
*  And it's Einstein's theory of special relativity [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3443.04s)]
*  is a zeroeth principle discovery [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3448.84s)]
*  because you can't go from Newtonian physics [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3451.04s)]
*  to his special theory of relativity from first principles. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3454.32s)]
*  He pulled it out of another dimension. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3457.12s)]
*  A germ theory is a zeroeth principle discovery [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3460.48s)]
*  because if you say my eyes are the custodian [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3463.2799999999997s)]
*  of all knowledge and you realize this thing [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3465.68s)]
*  is this microscopic object, [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3468.44s)]
*  you pull it out of another dimension. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3470.4s)]
*  So pretty much any paradigm shift [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3471.8s)]
*  is gonna be zeroeth principle. Exactly, yeah. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3473.16s)]
*  The vanishing point in Renaissance art. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3474.8s)]
*  Like you pull a dimension. What is the vanishing point? [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3477.32s)]
*  It's, you put the point and you draw the line [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3479.68s)]
*  so you have dimension in art. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3483.12s)]
*  Ah, like a road or something like that. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3485.6s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3487.96s)]
*  The vanishing point is a paradigm shift. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3488.7999999999997s)]
*  It is a zeroeth thinking. Exactly. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3490.96s)]
*  Got it. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3492.72s)]
*  So it's presenting something that has not existed before [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3493.56s)]
*  in any way, shape, or form. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3495.96s)]
*  There's nothing that precedes it. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3497.6s)]
*  It's not, multiplication is built on addition. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3498.7999999999997s)]
*  This is a brand new concept. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3501.8399999999997s)]
*  And rejects the first principle theory, [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3502.68s)]
*  thinking altogether, like kind of renders it null. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3504.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, exactly. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3506.52s)]
*  Like Euclid's elements to Cartesian geometry. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3507.64s)]
*  Like sometimes there's these huge jumps in mathematics. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3510.24s)]
*  We need another thing. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3513.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so German another thing. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3514.16s)]
*  And you right away. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3515.0s)]
*  We need another thing. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3516.3199999999997s)]
*  I started glossing over it. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3517.16s)]
*  I got you, I got you. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3519.0s)]
*  The germs? [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3519.96s)]
*  He said, he said, he said, he said Euclid's [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3520.7999999999997s)]
*  and I was like, I'm out! [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3523.7999999999997s)]
*  I was like, none of us know? [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3525.7999999999997s)]
*  I got what he said. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3527.36s)]
*  So we all thought, I see everything. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3528.72s)]
*  Everything that we know to be fact, science is based [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3531.16s)]
*  on what we can see. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3533.3199999999997s)]
*  Then somebody came around, there's like, [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3534.3599999999997s)]
*  no, there's a bunch of microbes you can't see at all. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3535.68s)]
*  Right, germ theory. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3537.6s)]
*  That will kill you. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3538.44s)]
*  So that took that, the way we looked at the world [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3539.2799999999997s)]
*  and it's like, that's actually completely incorrect. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3541.04s)]
*  Here's the truth. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3543.2s)]
*  That's the zeroth principle. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3544.04s)]
*  That first principle thinking. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3545.3599999999997s)]
*  That I get. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3546.2s)]
*  What's the Euclid thing you were talking about? [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3547.04s)]
*  I'll give you another example. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3549.44s)]
*  I'll give you another example. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3551.24s)]
*  Explain the thing we knew about. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3553.08s)]
*  It's his example he used. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3555.12s)]
*  But the theory is the theory. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3557.12s)]
*  Okay, Euclid. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3557.96s)]
*  Who's Euclid? [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3558.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, I'll give you another example. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3559.64s)]
*  There was never a need for zero to exist. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3561.52s)]
*  Zero had to be discovered. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3565.12s)]
*  People knew that you had one fish, you were cool, [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3567.4s)]
*  one piece of bread, you're cool, you have one thing. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3570.96s)]
*  But what's the utility of zero? [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3573.16s)]
*  I don't subscribe to this at all. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3575.36s)]
*  Because the Indians invented zero. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3578.44s)]
*  We know what zero is. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3580.84s)]
*  How many children do you have? [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3581.96s)]
*  You're like, I have no idea how many children [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3583.08s)]
*  are there in the world. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3585.16s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3586.0s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3586.84s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3587.68s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3588.52s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3589.36s)]
*  You're like, I have no idea how to fathom [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3590.2s)]
*  what number of children are there. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3592.16s)]
*  Zero, yeah. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3593.0s)]
*  How much pussy do Indians get? [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3593.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3594.9199999999996s)]
*  Like there's gotta be a number for these things. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3595.7599999999998s)]
*  That's one thing. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3599.24s)]
*  Yeah, you do. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3600.08s)]
*  That was a bad example. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3600.9199999999996s)]
*  Also, even if you don't wanna give it to me. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3601.7599999999998s)]
*  So yeah, the idea of zero is there. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3603.16s)]
*  We know it's there. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3607.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so there's this book, [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3608.52s)]
*  A Biography of a Dangerous Idea, [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3609.64s)]
*  which is the discovery of zero. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3611.6s)]
*  It took humanity hundreds of years to discover zero. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3614.68s)]
*  You don't believe that? [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3617.96s)]
*  Yeah, oh yeah. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3618.7999999999997s)]
*  Zero broke mathematics. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3620.44s)]
*  Zero broke religion. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3622.0s)]
*  Zero broke- [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3623.12s)]
*  How many antelope did you hunt today, babe? [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3624.16s)]
*  Oh, we got no antelope. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3626.92s)]
*  Zero, we brought back zero. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3628.64s)]
*  We're gonna starve. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3629.96s)]
*  Are you talking about the mathematical application [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3630.7999999999997s)]
*  or the conceptual, like social application? [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3632.2s)]
*  All of the above. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3633.96s)]
*  There's no way that people didn't know [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3635.3599999999997s)]
*  that there was nothing there. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3636.72s)]
*  Yeah, I would need for you to prove this [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3637.92s)]
*  because I want Indians to get credit, [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3639.8799999999997s)]
*  but please disprove. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3641.72s)]
*  What were they doing before that? [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3642.7599999999998s)]
*  He's dumb, I just need you to tell him [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3643.6s)]
*  because I don't. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3644.92s)]
*  But what were they doing before that? [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3646.08s)]
*  Because I might be dumber. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3646.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3647.7599999999998s)]
*  You're talking about, yeah, sure. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3649.02s)]
*  You can say I didn't get anything when I hunted today, [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3652.2999999999997s)]
*  which is basically zero. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3654.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3656.2999999999997s)]
*  But without zero, even on a calendar, year one, [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3657.86s)]
*  we didn't start at year zero. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3662.94s)]
*  Zero was not a number in operation across mathematics, [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3665.62s)]
*  across philosophy, across zero still is an issue [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3669.14s)]
*  in quantum mechanics and mathematics [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3672.58s)]
*  that still breaks all of our things. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3675.1s)]
*  So zero, let me give you another example. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3676.98s)]
*  Like why? [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3679.62s)]
*  I don't. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3680.46s)]
*  Zero, let me try to bridge this. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3681.3s)]
*  I feel like this is the easiest thing [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3685.38s)]
*  that people understood. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3686.7400000000002s)]
*  I think most of life. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3687.7000000000003s)]
*  It might have been a concept, [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3688.54s)]
*  but zero is a number and an idea. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3689.5s)]
*  Yeah, the mathematical application. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3691.34s)]
*  Yeah, mathematical application, sure, [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3692.66s)]
*  but conceptually people knew what nothing is [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3694.26s)]
*  because most of their life was nothing. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3696.3s)]
*  I think they never thought to apply it in the same way. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3697.62s)]
*  My stomach has zero in it, I need to go get some food. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3699.26s)]
*  We understood emptiness, we understood nothing. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3701.58s)]
*  So yeah, I can see your point. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3703.82s)]
*  Do people understand? [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3706.26s)]
*  Sick. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3707.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3707.94s)]
*  Well done. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3708.78s)]
*  Got him, you claimed that. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3709.6200000000003s)]
*  You got me, you got me. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3711.1000000000004s)]
*  Okay, okay, but now. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3713.34s)]
*  So back to zero principle thinking. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3714.86s)]
*  It's like there are these discoveries in existence [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3716.38s)]
*  that change paradigms. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3718.82s)]
*  The Earth is not the center of the universe [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3720.78s)]
*  that we are actually orbiting the sun [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3724.5400000000004s)]
*  in this larger galaxy or we're extended out. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3727.0600000000004s)]
*  So ideas that come and they break our reality. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3729.0200000000004s)]
*  And so humans have been able to discover zeros, [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3732.54s)]
*  one every once in a while. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3736.74s)]
*  So not very frequently, but we do it, [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3739.1s)]
*  we discover germs or we discover special relativity. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3741.9s)]
*  And then society is like, that's stupid as fuck. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3745.38s)]
*  Then we growl around to it, like actually that's obvious, [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3747.74s)]
*  but it takes us a while to digest zeros. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3750.58s)]
*  Whereas ones are easy. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3753.26s)]
*  If you just say, we take this given thing, it's working, [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3754.78s)]
*  we're gonna make it better. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3757.86s)]
*  So much easier to understand. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3758.98s)]
*  Electric cars. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3760.58s)]
*  But aren't all the zeroes predicated on prior [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3761.74s)]
*  like technology and science? [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3765.7799999999997s)]
*  Like what would. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3767.3399999999997s)]
*  Then it wouldn't be a zero, bro. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3768.18s)]
*  But what would foundationally make it a zero if, [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3769.3799999999997s)]
*  like for example, like I don't know, [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3772.14s)]
*  like any one of these inventions [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3774.22s)]
*  or even like the germ theory, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3775.7799999999997s)]
*  like there's some type of scientific method [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3777.02s)]
*  that's in place that then is able to deduce [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3778.58s)]
*  that germs are actually the cause of these illnesses [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3780.14s)]
*  and things like that. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3782.2999999999997s)]
*  Like what would make it zero with [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3783.2599999999998s)]
*  if there are things that preceded like technological. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3784.66s)]
*  How do we figure out germs? [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3786.4199999999996s)]
*  Who figured out germs? [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3787.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3789.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3790.5s)]
*  Who zeroed that up? [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3791.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3792.1800000000003s)]
*  I mean, Lister was one. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3793.02s)]
*  There's a few others at the time who were playing with it. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3794.54s)]
*  Huh. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3797.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3798.26s)]
*  Well, who? [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3799.1000000000004s)]
*  Lister? [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3799.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3800.78s)]
*  And then where was. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3801.6200000000003s)]
*  Is that where Listerine comes from? [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3802.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3803.3s)]
*  Get out of here. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3804.1400000000003s)]
*  Didn't I know. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3804.98s)]
*  And then, how did he zero that? [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3805.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3807.7400000000002s)]
*  I don't know his exact methodology. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3808.5800000000004s)]
*  You know, like sometimes like, you know, [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3809.7000000000003s)]
*  penicillin, the antibiotic. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3811.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3812.5s)]
*  You know, that was a discovery of accident. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3813.34s)]
*  So it grew in a Petri dish, you know, [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3816.1000000000004s)]
*  over the weekend. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3818.7s)]
*  Do you know how that was discovered? [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3819.54s)]
*  Somebody was dancing in Brooklyn for like six hours. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3820.9799999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3823.4599999999996s)]
*  And woke up the next morning. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3824.2999999999997s)]
*  Piss was on fire. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3825.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3826.7799999999997s)]
*  Back to that. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3827.62s)]
*  Did you. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3828.4599999999996s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3829.2999999999997s)]
*  Relatable. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3830.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3830.9799999999996s)]
*  I'm sorry, I have to use a bathroom. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3831.8199999999997s)]
*  Go, go, go. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3832.66s)]
*  We probably can't. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3833.5s)]
*  Okay, okay, okay. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3834.3399999999997s)]
*  So penicillin is a zero. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3835.4199999999996s)]
*  But like what Mark just said, [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3837.4199999999996s)]
*  it's based on some sort of scientific research, right? [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3839.2599999999998s)]
*  So a cure to a disease, is that a zero? [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3843.4199999999996s)]
*  Like, what is it? [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3846.86s)]
*  What was it? [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3847.9s)]
*  Smallpox, they found that there was another type of pox. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3848.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3852.38s)]
*  They could get the pus from. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3853.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3854.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3855.06s)]
*  Is that a zero? [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3855.9s)]
*  The idea of taking disease. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3856.86s)]
*  Or is that a one? [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3858.3s)]
*  Yeah, so there's a gradient, right? [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3859.2200000000003s)]
*  Like things that we'd say are more categorically zero, [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3860.5s)]
*  then there's things that are ones, [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3864.2200000000003s)]
*  and there's a sliding scale where it's like. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3865.1000000000004s)]
*  Okay, so there's a little bit of a spectrum here. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3866.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3868.46s)]
*  Got it, got it. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3869.3s)]
*  We're looking for this finite zero, never exists before. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3870.1200000000003s)]
*  Maybe Einstein's was a theory of relativity. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3871.82s)]
*  Is that zero? [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3874.06s)]
*  Yes. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3875.1000000000004s)]
*  Got it. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3876.06s)]
*  Nothing else comes into play before at all like this. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3876.9s)]
*  And for that reason, [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3879.7799999999997s)]
*  where like this is the most mind blowing thing [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3881.1s)]
*  we've ever seen. Exactly. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3882.82s)]
*  Even though when it's applied right now, [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3883.82s)]
*  you're like, well, yeah, obviously. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3885.62s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3886.94s)]
*  Yeah, obviously the ball's moving as fast as me [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3887.7799999999997s)]
*  if we're both on a train. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3889.94s)]
*  Like the wheel would be a zero. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3890.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3892.7s)]
*  Right? [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3893.54s)]
*  Because it's like, in terms of just transportation, [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3894.38s)]
*  it has changed drastically just because we, [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3897.06s)]
*  someone thought of, hey, let me just make a wheel. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3900.9s)]
*  And at the time, it was probably just absolutely insane. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3903.14s)]
*  Okay. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3906.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, whereas we're much better at creating [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3907.1s)]
*  mechanical structures and these objects, [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3909.46s)]
*  whereas then they're probably just absurd. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3911.2999999999997s)]
*  So the idea is like, to this point is, [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3913.22s)]
*  zeros change reality. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3916.3399999999997s)]
*  Zero, and we humans have been the authors of zero [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3918.8999999999996s)]
*  up until this point. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3921.7s)]
*  Like we discovered these things. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3922.54s)]
*  And now AI is the author of zero. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3923.54s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3925.02s)]
*  Now, so we humans are primarily a first principles [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3925.8599999999997s)]
*  thinking species, but we do things slow, [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3929.2599999999998s)]
*  like incrementally, zeros come along and crush our reality. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3931.46s)]
*  And you want AI to be curating zeros [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3935.22s)]
*  that benefit us, not it. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3939.18s)]
*  And not only, yeah, so basically AI is a zero manufacturer. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3941.94s)]
*  And they can churn them out. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3947.2999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3948.74s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3949.58s)]
*  So you take the things that AI has been doing, [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3950.4199999999996s)]
*  like protein folding, and then it basically solves, [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3952.3399999999997s)]
*  even when you say when it played [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3957.8199999999997s)]
*  the world champion of Go, right? [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3959.02s)]
*  It introduced moves in Go that stunned human. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3961.5s)]
*  Humans have been playing this game for thousands of years. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3966.34s)]
*  Human genius has played this game for thousands of years. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3968.06s)]
*  And they couldn't even conceptualize it. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3970.38s)]
*  You give AlphaGo a hundred hours to play itself, [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3971.58s)]
*  and it crushes the first principles way humans play Go, [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3974.86s)]
*  and changes the game in that instant. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3978.94s)]
*  So you're confident that we'll develop an AGI, [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3981.2200000000003s)]
*  like artificial general intelligence? [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3983.46s)]
*  I'm confident, so I would be hesitant to short [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3986.46s)]
*  the improvement of artificial intelligence. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3992.46s)]
*  Of all the things that was short in existence, [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3995.02s)]
*  that's one I would probably not short on. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3996.54s)]
*  I've heard that hypothetical kind of- [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=3998.22s)]
*  Just real quick to bring Akash up to speed. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4000.1s)]
*  AI is a zero manufacturing machine [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4002.98s)]
*  in that it just constantly can conjure up new zeros. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4007.38s)]
*  So like to the zero point, and kind of like this idea [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4011.22s)]
*  I think that we're touching on of like [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4014.06s)]
*  this general intelligence. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4015.22s)]
*  I've heard it put this way that like level one, [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4016.74s)]
*  and the numbers might kind of throw this off, [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4019.82s)]
*  but like number one would be, [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4021.46s)]
*  could you create a computer or an AI [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4023.1s)]
*  that could beat the best person in chess? [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4025.18s)]
*  And we've blasted that for, I don't know, [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4027.66s)]
*  30 years or something. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4030.02s)]
*  Then level two would be, [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4031.1s)]
*  could the AI create a move that's never been done in chess? [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4031.94s)]
*  And all the times and all the ways that we play this game, [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4035.18s)]
*  can it invent a new way to play? [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4037.34s)]
*  And then the third iteration is, [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4039.02s)]
*  could this AI invent chess? [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4040.22s)]
*  Like this idea of chess. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4042.66s)]
*  And I'm assuming that this creation of chess [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4044.7400000000002s)]
*  would be the zero that we're talking about. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4045.58s)]
*  That it creates, and again, I'm using chess [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4047.26s)]
*  as just an example, but create the form of the thing [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4048.78s)]
*  rather than playing within the rules of the thing [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4051.3s)]
*  in and of itself. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4053.34s)]
*  Yeah, well said. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4054.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you're getting your head around the structure [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4055.0s)]
*  of invention, gameplay, rules. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4056.62s)]
*  Like yes, like that's exactly the place we're in. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4058.78s)]
*  And that's the zero point. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4060.82s)]
*  And it's important, I guess, that we create alignment [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4062.5s)]
*  with the super intelligence, the zeros, Andrew's idea. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4064.5s)]
*  Yeah, so now you've- [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4068.6600000000003s)]
*  It's creating chess for us. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4069.58s)]
*  That's great, it's like I have a game [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4070.86s)]
*  that I feel like even better than this. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4072.34s)]
*  You like playing tennis, I have a better tennis. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4074.1000000000004s)]
*  Right, it's called paddle. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4076.1800000000003s)]
*  It's called paddle, right. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4077.6200000000003s)]
*  But like it basically can download our, [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4078.46s)]
*  every reactive fiber tissue in our brain [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4082.54s)]
*  and see what the most, what is that called [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4087.2200000000003s)]
*  when you have the positive feelings, it's- [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4091.26s)]
*  Serotonin. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4093.46s)]
*  Yeah, the serotonin inducing moments of a game, [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4094.3s)]
*  and then curate a totally different game [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4096.88s)]
*  that just focuses on those, oh wow. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4098.62s)]
*  Customize for you. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4101.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4102.62s)]
*  So now if you map where we've been. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4104.06s)]
*  So first of all, I pose the question to you guys, [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4105.5s)]
*  and you say, get the fuck out of my space. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4108.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4111.46s)]
*  Okay, then we frame it from a new angle, [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4112.3s)]
*  and we say, huh, you're right. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4114.900000000001s)]
*  Like we actually don't have everything figured out, [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4117.26s)]
*  and we're probably gonna change [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4119.14s)]
*  just like every other generation has changed before us. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4120.42s)]
*  And then we say, okay, what's different about now? [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4122.82s)]
*  And we're saying, okay, AI is here, [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4125.02s)]
*  and it's going to manufacture these zeros [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4127.9400000000005s)]
*  at speeds which are faster [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4129.98s)]
*  than we've ever had in our entire existence. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4133.179999999999s)]
*  And therefore, what do we know about reality anymore at all? [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4135.7s)]
*  So can we take any of the games we play now in Tooniverse, [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4141.339999999999s)]
*  like wealth accumulation, status seeking, power, [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4144.0599999999995s)]
*  all the games that we humans have agreed upon playing, [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4147.58s)]
*  we're all playing the games, [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4150.879999999999s)]
*  do any of those games survive [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4152.5s)]
*  a continued introduction of zeros? [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4155.5s)]
*  When zeros are introduced, [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4158.42s)]
*  they have the power of scrambling human affairs. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4159.9800000000005s)]
*  And now if you say the dominant form of intelligence [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4163.46s)]
*  is no longer homo sapiens, [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4166.22s)]
*  the dominant form of intelligence [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4168.1s)]
*  is artificial intelligence. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4169.860000000001s)]
*  It's the custodian of knowledge. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4170.9800000000005s)]
*  It's the custodian, [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4173.38s)]
*  and it's interesting zeros at the same time. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4174.46s)]
*  So we basically are no longer the custodians, [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4177.9800000000005s)]
*  and we're playing in a zero principle reality. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4181.58s)]
*  And so it's kind of a nightmare for most of our emotions [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4185.3s)]
*  because we love certainty, [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4187.64s)]
*  we want to know, and we hate uncertainty. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4189.56s)]
*  And we're getting hit on both fronts. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4192.96s)]
*  Do you believe that all zeros possess objective good? [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4196.240000000001s)]
*  That for every zero that's introduced, [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4199.280000000001s)]
*  it should be embraced and accepted? [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4200.64s)]
*  That's a great question. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4202.72s)]
*  I mean, so this is where I come back to, don't die, [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4204.4800000000005s)]
*  is that if in this situation, [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4208.6s)]
*  so that question presumes that I as a homo sapien [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4211.22s)]
*  have some kind of authority over an opinion [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4216.38s)]
*  about some kind of social or ethical norm. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4219.5s)]
*  And maybe that's true, maybe it's not. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4223.14s)]
*  But the observation here is that we're walking [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4226.18s)]
*  into a future that is so different from what we have now, [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4228.780000000001s)]
*  maybe none of our priors are going to carry over. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4232.400000000001s)]
*  We think we're gonna play the same game. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4236.54s)]
*  We think we're the architects of this reality, [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4238.14s)]
*  but that may not be the case. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4240.3s)]
*  And so if we say, if that is the moment, [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4241.66s)]
*  what do we do as a species? [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4244.78s)]
*  You're saying hang on. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4247.94s)]
*  That's it, don't die. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4249.139999999999s)]
*  The only game we can play is hold on and don't die [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4250.259999999999s)]
*  because we have no idea. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4254.66s)]
*  So the games of acquiring wealth, power, success [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4257.0199999999995s)]
*  are no longer valuable because these new zeros [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4261.7s)]
*  that will be thrown into the system [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4265.0599999999995s)]
*  could completely throw out a whack our ambitions. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4268.179999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4271.82s)]
*  You could spend your life trying to be the greatest, [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4273.14s)]
*  I don't know, race car driver. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4279.1s)]
*  And then next year, race car driving is obsolete [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4280.9800000000005s)]
*  because there's this new system that we all watch [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4283.42s)]
*  and we all care about. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4285.38s)]
*  And nobody gives a fuck about driving an F1 car. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4286.9400000000005s)]
*  But wouldn't that only be the case if humanity [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4289.22s)]
*  all agrees to adopt using AI in this manner? [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4292.900000000001s)]
*  Because right now, the way people are using AI [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4295.9800000000005s)]
*  is just to keep playing the games [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4298.5s)]
*  that we currently agree to play better. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4302.24s)]
*  So how as humans are we going to decide to use AI? [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4306.04s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4309.719999999999s)]
*  So that's the most important question to me is, [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4310.5599999999995s)]
*  so we build these really powerful forms of intelligence [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4312.92s)]
*  and then what do we do? [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4315.32s)]
*  Do we become better at war? [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4316.16s)]
*  Do we become better at killing each other? [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4318.679999999999s)]
*  Do we become better at getting social media followers? [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4320.5599999999995s)]
*  Do we become better at making money in the stock market? [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4323.24s)]
*  Where do you apply it? [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4325.44s)]
*  And if you say in any reasonable timeframe, [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4327.04s)]
*  AI is again going to become a million [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4329.32s)]
*  to a billion plus times smarter than us. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4331.599999999999s)]
*  This idea that we retain control of this thing, [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4334.48s)]
*  we don't know what's gonna happen, [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4339.8s)]
*  but to me it seems like walking into this future [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4341.5199999999995s)]
*  with as much unknown as we have. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4348.88s)]
*  I mean, you think about this, [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4350.16s)]
*  like every generation before us. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4351.04s)]
*  You're back at religion, dude. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4353.759999999999s)]
*  I know. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4355.719999999999s)]
*  You look back. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4356.5599999999995s)]
*  So go back to the centuries. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4358.52s)]
*  Any human could be born and say. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4360.320000000001s)]
*  Submitting yourself to the ultimate power. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4361.88s)]
*  And it's a man made god. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4364.080000000001s)]
*  Or it could be. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4366.200000000001s)]
*  It's a man like we created god again. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4367.040000000001s)]
*  This is the irony. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4370.200000000001s)]
*  This is where we're at. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4371.040000000001s)]
*  And so whether it's god or something else, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4371.88s)]
*  we just agreed to not die. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4373.9400000000005s)]
*  So like when I was going through this decade long process [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4377.56s)]
*  of trying to figure out what to do, I was thinking, okay, [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4380.320000000001s)]
*  so I just left my religion, which was like this idea. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4382.320000000001s)]
*  It was a really cool game to play. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4386.6s)]
*  You play by the rules, you get this prize. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4387.72s)]
*  I didn't believe it anymore. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4389.16s)]
*  It's like, what do you do? [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4390.52s)]
*  And I thought, okay, well, I don't wanna die. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4391.76s)]
*  Like that's the only thing I know [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4393.64s)]
*  is I really appreciate existence [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4394.84s)]
*  and I wanna keep on living. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4396.360000000001s)]
*  And so there's three things that. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4397.68s)]
*  Even though you were wildly depressed [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4399.400000000001s)]
*  and you were suicidal. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4400.76s)]
*  Post. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4401.96s)]
*  Post. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4402.8s)]
*  This is after the death of the audience. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4403.64s)]
*  After the warehouse, yeah. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4404.4800000000005s)]
*  Now you found joy, you found love. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4405.320000000001s)]
*  There's something worth living for. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4407.56s)]
*  And you're like, I wanna ride this [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4408.400000000001s)]
*  as long as I possibly can. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4410.2s)]
*  Yeah. Okay, got it. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4411.52s)]
*  And like the critical thing for my mind was telling me [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4412.360000000001s)]
*  that I wanted to die, but I'm so happy [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4417.2s)]
*  I didn't listen to my mind. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4420.32s)]
*  And this got me to the issue of my experiment with Blueprint [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4423.12s)]
*  is I said, okay, so if we're walking [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4426.32s)]
*  into a zero principle future, [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4428.2s)]
*  and I was starting to think about the biographies I read. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4431.76s)]
*  So if you think back to early American colonies, [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4434.76s)]
*  there were 13 colonies. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4436.599999999999s)]
*  They were in a situation where they were debating [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4438.44s)]
*  whether democracy was a good idea [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4440.48s)]
*  or whether they should stay with the monarch. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4441.84s)]
*  And they said, the monarch is strong and sturdy. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4443.599999999999s)]
*  We've had it for quite some time. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4445.92s)]
*  Let's just do that. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4447.84s)]
*  Half the population was like, no, no, no, [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4448.88s)]
*  we should really do the democracy thing. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4449.72s)]
*  And people are like, that's insane. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4450.72s)]
*  I'm not gonna trust so and so. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4452.12s)]
*  That was a zero principle. That's stupid. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4452.96s)]
*  So Thomas Paine wrote this out of this pamphlet, [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4455.16s)]
*  Common Sense, and he said, hey guys, [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4456.8s)]
*  like we really should do democracy. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4458.4s)]
*  The monarch does not understand our problems. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4460.12s)]
*  They don't understand local on the ground stuff. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4462.32s)]
*  And democracy went out. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4465.2s)]
*  It was a new system of processing information [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4466.6s)]
*  with a bunch of humans. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4470.4s)]
*  And so I said, can I create a new system with my body? [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4471.84s)]
*  So my mind is the monarch. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4475.48s)]
*  My body, my body's organs is the democracy. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4478.04s)]
*  So I started measuring every organ of my body to say, [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4481.4s)]
*  hey, heart, lungs, pancreas, liver, how are you? [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4483.639999999999s)]
*  What do you need? You speak. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4486.2s)]
*  What do you need? [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4487.12s)]
*  So I switched my power systems from my mind to my body. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4488.36s)]
*  I said, you run the show because my mind [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4493.759999999999s)]
*  is gonna want to eat the ice cream [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4495.96s)]
*  and it's gonna wanna drink [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4498.0s)]
*  and it's gonna wanna stay up late. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4499.08s)]
*  And it's gonna wanna- Your mind is indulgent. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4500.4s)]
*  It's a tyrant that will do anything to remain in power. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4503.0s)]
*  How much are you still battling with your mind right now? [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4508.12s)]
*  I've got it. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4510.4s)]
*  For the first time in my life, I've got it. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4512.12s)]
*  Do you think you could have snacks in your house? [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4515.56s)]
*  There's no, there's nothing in my house. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4517.68s)]
*  But could you? [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4518.96s)]
*  Do you have the discipline? [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4519.88s)]
*  I don't trust my mind. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4520.72s)]
*  So, okay, so you, okay, you don't got it. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4521.96s)]
*  Okay. Yeah. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4524.6s)]
*  Okay. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4525.44s)]
*  Fair point, fair point. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4526.28s)]
*  But I guess like, it's at least I know- [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4528.28s)]
*  But you know that enough about your mind [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4530.44s)]
*  so you'll set up those, okay. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4532.72s)]
*  Exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4534.08s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4536.0s)]
*  Yeah. So this is the thing. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4537.0s)]
*  So you piece all these things together and say, [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4538.12s)]
*  okay, we're building intelligence. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4540.08s)]
*  The species we're trying to decide what to do. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4542.0s)]
*  I'm expressing opinions about reality. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4544.240000000001s)]
*  I can't control myself. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4546.08s)]
*  Like what do we do as a species? [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4547.56s)]
*  I tried to basically become [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4548.96s)]
*  the existential problems facing humanity. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4551.400000000001s)]
*  And so I said, okay, I, Brian Johnson, [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4553.6s)]
*  am a collection of 35 trillion cells. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4555.76s)]
*  That's me. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4557.88s)]
*  How do I align my 35 trillion cells [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4559.0s)]
*  with one objective? [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4561.76s)]
*  Don't die. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4562.72s)]
*  That means I have to stop eating ice cream and junk food [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4564.12s)]
*  and I have to stop going to bed late. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4567.24s)]
*  Now, when you say mind, [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4568.360000000001s)]
*  can you parse that between your reason [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4569.88s)]
*  and like sort of rational thought and your emotions? [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4572.72s)]
*  Which those things I think comprise the mind. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4575.68s)]
*  And now we're kind of getting to like a consciousness [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4578.0s)]
*  discussion, but like those two things comprising [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4579.72s)]
*  the mind, quote unquote. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4581.88s)]
*  I oftentimes wonder if like your reason might say, [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4583.4400000000005s)]
*  oh, I shouldn't eat the ice cream, [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4586.24s)]
*  but it's your emotional state that might say, [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4587.2s)]
*  oh, I do want the ice cream. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4589.04s)]
*  So when you say you're trying to override your mind, [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4590.44s)]
*  do you mean the emotion or the reason? [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4592.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, you bring up a great point. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4594.919999999999s)]
*  There's definitely nuance. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4597.04s)]
*  I oversimplify for the purpose of conversation. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4598.32s)]
*  What I focus on is when food is in front of me, [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4602.839999999999s)]
*  whatever food it is, is generated by an algorithm [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4606.639999999999s)]
*  based upon my organs, not based upon how I feel [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4610.04s)]
*  or what I want or what I think sounds good. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4614.04s)]
*  It's an algorithm pulling data from my body, [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4616.5199999999995s)]
*  looking at scientific evidence and feeding it in. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4618.84s)]
*  And so this is the same way where it was unthinkable [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4620.84s)]
*  that a monarch wouldn't run a nation state [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4623.360000000001s)]
*  and that a bunch of the body's organs [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4625.320000000001s)]
*  would run in a democracy. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4627.320000000001s)]
*  I did the same thing for me and I proved to myself [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4628.92s)]
*  that an algorithm, I built an algorithm [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4632.320000000001s)]
*  that takes better care of me than I can myself. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4634.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, because your mind is gonna wake up [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4637.72s)]
*  and be a little bit sad and go, you know what, [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4641.08s)]
*  I want pancakes for breakfast. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4642.84s)]
*  And you know what, today's the day, [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4644.16s)]
*  like today's Saturday, it's gorgeous out. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4645.08s)]
*  Yeah, I should get some ice cream. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4647.68s)]
*  So do you ever satisfy the emotion? [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4649.32s)]
*  Does the emotion ever want anything? [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4650.84s)]
*  And do you ever try to satisfy it in some way? [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4653.04s)]
*  Or like exercise? [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4655.68s)]
*  Or do you have less of those emotions? [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4657.04s)]
*  I have less. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4658.88s)]
*  Because you're actually feeding your body what it needs, [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4659.72s)]
*  therefore you desire those things less, [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4663.48s)]
*  you're less sad, you're less depressed. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4665.44s)]
*  Yes, cravings for sugar probably go down. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4667.08s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4668.72s)]
*  When's the last time you went against the algorithm, [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4669.5599999999995s)]
*  AKA a cheat day? [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4671.96s)]
*  Yeah, it was years ago. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4673.2s)]
*  My son and I went and did it together. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4674.96s)]
*  We were curious about it. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4677.72s)]
*  What'd you do? [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4678.8s)]
*  I had some fries, I had some chili cheese fries, [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4680.24s)]
*  I think, something like that. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4684.32s)]
*  And? [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4685.6s)]
*  I felt so sick, I wanted to vomit. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4686.44s)]
*  The second you ate them or a little bit after? [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4689.52s)]
*  A little after. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4691.76s)]
*  But during eating them? [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4692.6s)]
*  They felt disgusting to me. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4693.96s)]
*  No way. Yeah, they did. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4695.2s)]
*  So you can trick your body into rejecting these things [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4696.52s)]
*  that it actually doesn't want. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4699.68s)]
*  And he gave me a chip and it tasted like gasoline. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4701.24s)]
*  Like it just, it felt abhorrent. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4705.16s)]
*  Not even saying this teasingly, [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4708.12s)]
*  the food you eat now to us doesn't seem like it tastes good, [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4709.639999999999s)]
*  to you does it taste good? [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4712.12s)]
*  This is the thing is, I know people, [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4713.28s)]
*  they view what I do and they assume I'm miserable. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4715.8s)]
*  They assume I'm in a cage of my own making. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4720.639999999999s)]
*  They assume the food is not good. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4722.44s)]
*  I've never in my entire life been happier. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4724.5199999999995s)]
*  I've never been more stable. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4727.32s)]
*  I've never enjoyed food more. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4728.5599999999995s)]
*  I have never in my entire life felt better. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4730.36s)]
*  So you have kind of trained, was it like that always? [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4733.2s)]
*  As soon as you started eating this kind of food, [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4735.679999999999s)]
*  chocolate covered mushrooms and whatever, [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4737.719999999999s)]
*  was it like, oh, this tastes good? [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4739.48s)]
*  Or did you have to train your body, your mind, et cetera? [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4741.719999999999s)]
*  A little bit of both. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4744.28s)]
*  Okay. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4746.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4746.84s)]
*  We could say it's the opposite. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4747.679999999999s)]
*  We trained our body to liking that type of food. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4749.08s)]
*  Yeah, I take note. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4752.08s)]
*  That we evolved for years to not eat processed foods. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4752.92s)]
*  And now we've accustomed ourselves to it. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4755.759999999999s)]
*  I see this as a return to what we should. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4757.96s)]
*  Because it's like when you've been on a diet [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4760.96s)]
*  for a long period of time, [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4762.64s)]
*  the food that is your diet food [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4763.92s)]
*  starts to taste a lot better. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4765.84s)]
*  It's easier to eat, like you'll crave that salad, [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4767.12s)]
*  but before the first couple of times, [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4771.12s)]
*  it's just like a. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4773.04s)]
*  That makes complete sense. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4773.88s)]
*  All right, guys, let's face it. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4774.92s)]
*  We all want a way to eat healthy protein packed meals, [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4776.16s)]
*  but spending hours in the kitchen to cook healthy food sucks. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4779.12s)]
*  Cleanup sucks even more. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4782.28s)]
*  The whole thing sucks. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4783.5599999999995s)]
*  That's why you gotta check out Flex Pro Meals. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4784.92s)]

*  Do you understand how important that is for an Indian? [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4814.56s)]
*  Every month you get a $50 credit for meals added [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4816.360000000001s)]

*  Your boy got a decent head of hair, [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4925.36s)]
*  but I do have dandy rough, [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4927.24s)]
*  and I hate to say it, it's a little disgusting, [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4928.5199999999995s)]
*  but I get the key to cotton is all shampooed from Keeps. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4930.8s)]
*  I probably need some more Keeps holler at me. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4933.320000000001s)]

*  If you can't spell flagrant, look down. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4946.68s)]
*  It's right there. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4948.320000000001s)]
*  Let's get back to the show. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4949.16s)]
*  Okay, we're not done with this game yet. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4950.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're the last turn. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4951.84s)]
*  Okay, I wanna make sure we stay on this game. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4953.52s)]
*  Then I have a couple questions. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4955.360000000001s)]
*  Okay, so the last turn of the conversation. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4956.320000000001s)]
*  So we've been at the mind revolts. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4960.44s)]
*  We become introspective. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4963.679999999999s)]
*  We assess what's happening in the world [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4965.5199999999995s)]
*  that might change our reality. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4967.5199999999995s)]
*  That then points to the initial question. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4970.44s)]
*  If you had an algorithm that could give you the best [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4974.599999999999s)]
*  physical, emotional, and spiritual health of your life, [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4978.32s)]
*  would you say yes to it? [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4982.48s)]
*  Now, in some ways, this is a question [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4984.48s)]
*  that measures your level of insanity. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4987.44s)]
*  Why would you not want the best physical, mental, [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4991.0s)]
*  and spiritual health? [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4997.0s)]
*  Like, so Andrew, is your presumption [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=4997.84s)]
*  you would do a better job with your freedom? [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5000.44s)]
*  Was that the premise of your argument, [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5005.08s)]
*  that you care about freedom more than anything in existence? [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5006.6s)]
*  And do you think you can actually beat it? [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5011.24s)]
*  This is the question that shines the light [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5012.92s)]
*  on the early 21st century of how strongly [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5015.32s)]
*  we prioritize the perceived authority of our minds. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5019.28s)]
*  So you think it's just my mind telling me [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5023.96s)]
*  that I want to use and exercise this freedom, [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5026.76s)]
*  and my body in reality doesn't want that. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5030.48s)]
*  It wants me to tap into this algorithm. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5033.16s)]
*  But your brain is an evil dictator [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5035.08s)]
*  that's trying to dispossess your body from it. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5036.32s)]
*  You'll be back. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5039.4s)]
*  Time will tell. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5041.48s)]
*  I guess I'm curious about the, I don't know, [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5042.719999999999s)]
*  I think there's some objections [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5044.92s)]
*  to the first and second question. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5046.32s)]
*  The first is like, best is a subjective term. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5047.48s)]
*  So obviously within the hypothetical, [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5051.24s)]
*  we have to accept that best is ultimately [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5052.48s)]
*  the objective best. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5054.5199999999995s)]
*  But it's hard for us to subscribe to it. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5056.0s)]
*  But like, what does it mean to like quantify [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5057.5599999999995s)]
*  the best spiritual position? [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5059.759999999999s)]
*  Better than what you have now. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5063.24s)]
*  Yeah, that you would basically say like, [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5065.5199999999995s)]
*  rooted in his life, it would be the happiest. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5067.5199999999995s)]
*  I guess why this is tricky is that we have to trust [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5069.5199999999995s)]
*  that what you say is the best would be the best for us. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5072.959999999999s)]
*  I think the tricky thing is that I think [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5075.6s)]
*  that I'm happier than you. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5078.120000000001s)]
*  When I might not be. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5079.96s)]
*  You could be 10 times happier than me. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5081.84s)]
*  And that could be my dictator brain telling me I am. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5083.68s)]
*  Sorry, what were you saying? [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5086.64s)]
*  To add to your point, for thousands of years, [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5087.64s)]
*  as far as I know, we have valued autonomy over everything, [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5089.64s)]
*  whether it's perceived or not. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5093.56s)]
*  So democracy, the reason we accepted that, [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5095.400000000001s)]
*  even though it's a zero-worth principle, [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5098.84s)]
*  it is further autonomy. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5101.4400000000005s)]
*  The monarch is not a part of me. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5103.400000000001s)]
*  So we need a baseline for that happiness [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5105.0s)]
*  that is not just you. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5107.64s)]
*  We need a brain interface that can measure it and tell us. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5109.68s)]
*  Yeah, and if I trusted you as that, [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5113.0s)]
*  and I was sitting here and I'm like, [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5116.4s)]
*  wow, I'm like 10 points below Brian, [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5117.56s)]
*  and I'd really like to experience [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5120.12s)]
*  what that is like for Brian. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5121.48s)]
*  Or if you could point to a day in my life and be like, [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5123.04s)]
*  see how happy you are now? [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5127.28s)]
*  You would be this happy. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5128.48s)]
*  You would be your wedding day happy every single day [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5131.24s)]
*  if you did this. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5134.56s)]
*  If you could actually give me an emotional state [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5135.88s)]
*  that I was gonna live within, [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5139.080000000001s)]
*  I think it'd be very easy to get me subscribed to that algorithm. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5140.88s)]
*  Wedding day happy, birth of baby happy every day. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5144.160000000001s)]
*  Burning man, Molly happy. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5148.360000000001s)]
*  Burning man, Molly happy. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5149.72s)]
*  Like it's... [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5151.280000000001s)]
*  And that is conceivable to me [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5152.120000000001s)]
*  because that is chemicals in your brain [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5153.080000000001s)]
*  just kind of doing things. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5154.56s)]
*  And now it's a real feeling and sensation [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5155.400000000001s)]
*  that I can tap into. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5157.64s)]
*  I do think that there's a variable here [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5159.88s)]
*  that makes it difficult for me [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5161.96s)]
*  to immediately subscribe to the algorithm. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5163.56s)]
*  And that is FOMO. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5165.68s)]
*  I think that I would probably feel envious [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5169.52s)]
*  of my friends and family that got to do these things [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5172.4800000000005s)]
*  that I knew induced happiness and joy [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5175.4800000000005s)]
*  and like the camaraderie, [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5177.68s)]
*  everything that I tried to do in my life is so collective. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5179.84s)]
*  I like being around people, I like talking. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5182.76s)]
*  And if I had to be at bed every single night at this time, [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5184.52s)]
*  if all of us did it together, [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5188.4800000000005s)]
*  I think I could get on board. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5191.88s)]
*  But if just I did it and I saw all my friends [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5194.4s)]
*  doing these other things, [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5196.2s)]
*  I think I would really get miss out now. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5197.2s)]
*  When they all died later [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5201.04s)]
*  and I was hanging out with my great, great, great, [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5203.12s)]
*  great, great grandkids, I wouldn't have FOMO. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5204.879999999999s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5209.28s)]
*  I feel you, yeah. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5210.12s)]
*  So yeah, it's a really complex question. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5210.959999999999s)]
*  What if the algorithm looks at your life and says, [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5213.04s)]
*  oh, having a child will induce this much stress [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5214.759999999999s)]
*  for the next 10 years? [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5217.0s)]
*  And so in your interest, you shouldn't have a kid. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5218.719999999999s)]
*  It's like an inconceivable idea [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5220.839999999999s)]
*  that you wouldn't wanna go through this human experience [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5222.88s)]
*  despite the algorithm telling you based off data [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5224.84s)]
*  that your cortisol is gonna go up X amount [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5227.36s)]
*  over the next 10 years. Very well said. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5229.72s)]
*  What do you think about that, Brian? [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5230.72s)]
*  This is the central question of our existence. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5232.64s)]
*  So if you want you size up how intelligence is progressing [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5237.8s)]
*  and once you realize that when algorithms do something, [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5244.08s)]
*  when technology does something better than we humans, [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5247.52s)]
*  we will squawk and complain [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5250.68s)]
*  and then we adopt it ferociously. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5253.56s)]
*  So the first time a telegraph sent a message, [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5255.2s)]
*  the Pony Express was dead. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5259.96s)]
*  The first time you could navigate in your car with GPS, [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5261.8s)]
*  the map for death. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5264.92s)]
*  So we have so much to say about everything, [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5266.68s)]
*  but how much of it is truly durable over time. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5273.04s)]
*  And so this is the thing is these algorithms, [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5276.88s)]
*  what I'm trying to show with Blueprint, [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5278.8s)]
*  just like Magellan said, [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5280.240000000001s)]
*  you can now sell around the world [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5281.44s)]
*  or Shackleton did his adventure or Amelia Aronha, [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5283.0s)]
*  so you can go across the Atlantic. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5284.92s)]
*  I'm trying to show an algorithm does a better job [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5287.12s)]
*  at taking care of me, of being me than I can myself. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5291.96s)]
*  Now, on top of that idea, [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5296.08s)]
*  there's thousands and thousands of questions, [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5298.599999999999s)]
*  just like democracy. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5300.44s)]
*  Democracy we said, hey, structurally, [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5301.28s)]
*  it's a better system to have ourselves in this manner [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5303.839999999999s)]
*  versus a monarch. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5307.4s)]
*  Now we've been working on the question of democracy [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5308.879999999999s)]
*  for 200 years. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5310.56s)]
*  We still haven't solved it. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5311.92s)]
*  The same thing is true with this. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5313.56s)]
*  If you have an algorithm that can legit keep you alive [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5315.0s)]
*  and be better, thousands of questions spring up [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5318.64s)]
*  and we're gonna fight over every one of those things. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5321.4400000000005s)]
*  But the observation is, [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5324.0s)]
*  can we be sober enough in this moment [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5325.360000000001s)]
*  to realize what's happening? [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5328.04s)]
*  And so if you take the same problem, [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5329.120000000001s)]
*  so I've been talking about don't die individually, [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5330.72s)]
*  but if you take me and replace me with planet Earth, [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5332.52s)]
*  the same concept applies. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5335.68s)]
*  So measure Earth with a million measurements, [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5337.68s)]
*  make Earth as quantified as we can. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5339.44s)]
*  And you say what creates a biosphere appropriate [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5341.759999999999s)]
*  for humans who inhabit this Earth? [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5344.719999999999s)]
*  Don't tell me Greta Thunberg was right, dude. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5347.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5350.04s)]
*  You're gonna break my heart. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5350.879999999999s)]
*  So you do the same protocol. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5352.96s)]
*  You measure, you look at scientific evidence, [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5354.599999999999s)]
*  you create a protocol, [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5356.719999999999s)]
*  that algorithm runs the biosphere of Earth [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5358.36s)]
*  to make sure it's home for us. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5361.24s)]
*  Same concept. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5363.5199999999995s)]
*  How can we be sure [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5364.48s)]
*  that the scientific evidence isn't gonna be skewed [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5368.68s)]
*  to benefit certain people or organizations? [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5372.6s)]
*  With you, I feel like it's very authentic [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5376.52s)]
*  because you bear the consequences of bad research. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5379.64s)]
*  But once you get big pharma involved, [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5383.56s)]
*  once you get government agencies involved. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5387.240000000001s)]
*  Military industrial complex. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5389.96s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't wanna make this whole vaccine thing, [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5391.280000000001s)]
*  but there's a stack of vaccines [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5394.12s)]
*  that just go in your kid immediately [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5395.72s)]
*  and people get paid off of that. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5397.36s)]
*  And listen, I'm sure there's tons of benefit to this, [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5399.44s)]
*  but how can we trust the efficacy of those studies [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5402.32s)]
*  when we already know that these organizations [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5405.36s)]
*  have manipulated research to profit? [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5408.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5411.2s)]
*  This is why I'm a broken record. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5412.2s)]
*  Don't die is the only philosophy of the human race. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5414.839999999999s)]
*  So don't die for me was a process of measure everything, [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5417.24s)]
*  look at all the data, look at scientific evidence [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5420.88s)]
*  and be open about everything. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5422.4s)]
*  It's a closed loop improvement system. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5423.96s)]
*  Don't die has to stack throughout society. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5427.400000000001s)]
*  Because what you're talking about is different groups [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5429.72s)]
*  have different incentives. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5431.8s)]
*  I'm talking about the food pyramid. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5432.8s)]
*  I'm talking about all these other versions of, [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5434.36s)]
*  it's not don't die, but like their early versions of it [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5437.08s)]
*  if you look at it, hey, this is the best way to eat. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5440.68s)]
*  And now the food pyramid is completely inverted. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5442.6s)]
*  Sorry to add to your point. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5445.96s)]
*  God damn. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5447.04s)]
*  This is exactly what he said. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5447.88s)]
*  Talking about carbohydrates, he got upset. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5451.4800000000005s)]
*  This is exactly what he said. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5454.04s)]
*  The food pyramid, if we're distrusting everybody, [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5454.92s)]
*  the government just like apparently threw that together. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5457.08s)]
*  There's no scientific backing for it. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5458.96s)]
*  The grain industry is probably lobbying for it. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5460.64s)]
*  But then for us as citizens, [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5463.0s)]
*  we're just trusting the government, the authority. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5464.24s)]
*  So how do you kind of safeguard against this? [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5466.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5470.400000000001s)]
*  The algorithm has to be open. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5473.36s)]
*  It has to be transparent. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5476.04s)]
*  It has to go across every stack of, [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5477.8s)]
*  every layer of society stack. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5479.88s)]
*  That we can't have these parts of society [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5482.08s)]
*  who have these secret motives [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5486.28s)]
*  that do certain things that cause people to die. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5487.88s)]
*  That's the way we used to do things. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5490.48s)]
*  How do we, like he said, how do we safeguard against that? [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5492.4s)]
*  What would you do, for example? [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5494.72s)]
*  I would apply the same open scientific process [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5497.36s)]
*  as everything, it's gotta be open. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5501.6s)]
*  Is it like blockchain where everyone can see [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5503.04s)]
*  every transaction so it kind of checks the balance? [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5506.2s)]
*  You have to see it. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5508.08s)]
*  You have to, like democracy, you have to open it up. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5509.16s)]
*  Now still, in democracy, people still play games [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5512.72s)]
*  of like concealment. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5514.08s)]
*  But you've got to open this up [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5516.08s)]
*  and build this tapestry of intelligence of don't die. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5517.8s)]
*  Don't die individually, don't kill the earth, [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5521.32s)]
*  don't kill each other. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5522.76s)]
*  Is there anybody, and I can't believe I'm suggesting this, [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5523.6s)]
*  but is there anybody managing this? [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5525.8s)]
*  Is there any kind of process or people put, [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5527.32s)]
*  is there any board, is there anybody [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5531.64s)]
*  that's gonna make sure that, [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5533.64s)]
*  make sure of the efficacy of these studies and data? [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5535.6s)]
*  Or does the AI itself make sure of it? [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5537.96s)]
*  We've gotta build these systems. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5540.92s)]
*  I wrote a book about this, [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5542.28s)]
*  and I present all these arguments. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5543.36s)]
*  For example, like in a situation where [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5544.6s)]
*  you're the control condition, [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5548.04s)]
*  so the AI is trying to build traffic maps [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5549.16s)]
*  and it's gonna send you down a street [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5551.96s)]
*  to find out if this is a good route or not. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5553.92s)]
*  Is that good for you or bad for you? [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5556.12s)]
*  That's good. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5557.4400000000005s)]
*  On an individual basis, it's bad for you. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5558.28s)]
*  It's complicated. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5559.6s)]
*  So I agree with you, these questions are all like, [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5560.52s)]
*  there's so many questions we have to sort, [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5563.4s)]
*  but we have to agree on something in society. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5565.52s)]
*  Because right now, what we agree upon is making money, [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5567.32s)]
*  acquiring status, acquiring power. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5569.76s)]
*  We agree upon those things. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5571.88s)]
*  We all play these games. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5572.92s)]
*  We don't agree and don't die. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5574.22s)]
*  And so I'm saying that it's the basis of society. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5575.96s)]
*  It's what we agree upon that we're playing the game. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5578.76s)]
*  Once we agree upon don't die as the game, [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5581.08s)]
*  then we will all be incentivized [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5584.240000000001s)]
*  to give proper data, true data, [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5586.400000000001s)]
*  because those people are also trying to not die. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5590.04s)]
*  Why would they tarnish their data [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5592.4400000000005s)]
*  that's gonna collectivize all information? [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5593.8s)]
*  And if someone tries to make you die, they lose status. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5595.2s)]
*  Because status is built on your ability [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5600.56s)]
*  to contribute to us not dying. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5601.4800000000005s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5603.08s)]
*  Where now status is built on money. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5603.92s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5605.68s)]
*  So if I'm serving you up. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5606.6s)]
*  We have to change the incentive structure. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5607.42s)]
*  We have to change everything. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5609.160000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5610.72s)]
*  This is good, this is good. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5611.56s)]
*  So how do you change the incentive structure? [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5612.400000000001s)]
*  First, you need to convince people [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5614.52s)]
*  that this is even possible. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5615.76s)]
*  Wow, this is a lot different conversation [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5617.400000000001s)]
*  that I thought we were gonna have. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5618.96s)]
*  I thought you were trying to break the 120 year mark. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5619.84s)]
*  You really do not wanna go. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5622.84s)]
*  And you believe that that's possible. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5624.62s)]
*  And I think you believe if we don't embrace this, [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5627.32s)]
*  humanity comes to an end. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5629.799999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5631.12s)]
*  Okay, this is. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5631.96s)]
*  Like quickly. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5632.92s)]
*  Yes. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5633.759999999999s)]
*  Okay, okay, okay, okay. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5634.58s)]
*  Where were we just at? [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5636.44s)]
*  I don't wanna miss where we were just at. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5637.639999999999s)]
*  You were in a good spot. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5639.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5640.4s)]
*  I wanna support you. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5641.24s)]
*  We all gotta think differently and change the incentive. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5642.0599999999995s)]
*  How do you change the incentive structure? [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5644.2s)]
*  We have a very clear incentive structure in America, [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5646.48s)]
*  make money at it. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5648.719999999999s)]
*  If you make money at it, it's good. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5649.88s)]
*  You were very successful at this. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5651.28s)]
*  You wanna also change that incentive structure. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5652.92s)]
*  Money is not the end. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5655.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5658.52s)]
*  Don't die is the end. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5659.34s)]
*  How do you get every single person in this country [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5660.4800000000005s)]
*  to submit themselves to that idea? [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5662.72s)]
*  So I think there's an interesting moment that's coming. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5665.06s)]
*  Someone said that sometimes [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5669.860000000001s)]
*  weeks of progress are made in decades [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5674.08s)]
*  and sometimes decades of progress are made in weeks. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5675.8s)]
*  As AI progresses forward, [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5679.4400000000005s)]
*  it's going to create corresponding existential crisis [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5682.04s)]
*  for the human race. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5685.64s)]
*  Can you give us an example, [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5687.0s)]
*  a hypothetical, just throw one out there. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5688.16s)]
*  Yeah, so a chat GPT comes out [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5689.56s)]
*  and we all have to rethink, [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5692.54s)]
*  do screenwriters have a place in this world? [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5694.68s)]
*  God. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5698.48s)]
*  Sora comes out and we say, [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5699.32s)]
*  do movie makers have a place in this world? [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5700.48s)]
*  And it seems sarcastic even to suggest [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5704.04s)]
*  but you 100% believe that with the exponential growth [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5709.04s)]
*  of AI, literally just telling Sora, [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5714.76s)]
*  which is this new AI that, what is it? [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5717.56s)]
*  Open AI came out with this. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5719.92s)]
*  It's basically you just give it some prompts [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5721.6s)]
*  and it can provide you with video, whatever you want. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5724.04s)]
*  Make me then another Harry Potter movie [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5726.96s)]
*  and it will just do it instantaneously. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5729.5199999999995s)]
*  You'll watch a two hour Harry Potter movie. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5731.0s)]
*  And it will be, they will create, [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5733.32s)]
*  they will be better at Disney, [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5735.64s)]
*  they'll be better at Pixar, [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5737.2s)]
*  they'll be better than, [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5738.28s)]
*  they will be better at all things we humans do. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5741.28s)]
*  And this is like, we're just getting started with AI. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5744.44s)]
*  So that's, I think the thing about people [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5747.639999999999s)]
*  who come from the tech sector is, [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5749.2s)]
*  is that you're already on board with what AI can be. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5751.4s)]
*  So there's no skepticism whatsoever. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5756.0199999999995s)]
*  And I think the average citizen of United States of America, [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5758.639999999999s)]
*  any country in the world has like a little skepticism. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5762.679999999999s)]
*  They're like, oh yeah, this chat GPT thing was cool [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5765.92s)]
*  and then they just go back to using Google. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5769.24s)]
*  It's done cool things, [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5770.48s)]
*  but it hasn't really replaced anything [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5772.28s)]
*  that they actually use or indulge in just yet. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5774.719999999999s)]
*  We're still waiting for that moment. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5778.44s)]
*  Once that moment happens, I think eyes light up. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5780.599999999999s)]
*  I think that's your, what did you call it? [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5784.4s)]
*  Zero. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5787.0s)]
*  Yeah, maybe that's your zero moment, [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5787.84s)]
*  your pendulum swing moment where the actual culture shifts. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5789.0s)]
*  Tipping point. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5792.08s)]
*  It is the tipping, [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5793.2s)]
*  but we haven't hit a tipping point just yet. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5794.04s)]
*  We've hit, oh, that's pretty cool that it can do that. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5795.5599999999995s)]
*  And then people just go back to their normal behavior. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5799.0s)]
*  But you guys, since you know the exponential growth [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5800.72s)]
*  of the AI, you believe it's coming [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5803.92s)]
*  without a shadow of a doubt. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5807.12s)]
*  You've driven in a car and you know [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5808.08s)]
*  that buggies will be obsolete. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5809.32s)]
*  That's right. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5812.04s)]
*  Okay. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5812.88s)]
*  It's, I mean, it's again, it's very hard to short AI. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5813.72s)]
*  Now, whether you want to say it's going to happen [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5817.8s)]
*  in two years or 10 years, [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5819.24s)]
*  a few years doesn't matter for all intents and purposes. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5820.24s)]
*  It's now. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5824.16s)]
*  Can I ask in your estimation, [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5825.36s)]
*  if we don't all adopt something similar [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5827.0s)]
*  to the way you view the world, [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5829.4s)]
*  how long does humanity have left? [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5830.64s)]
*  I mean, so we. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5833.04s)]
*  Paul Park. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5834.4s)]
*  Yeah, so we acquired species level annihilation weapons [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5835.36s)]
*  in the 60s. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5839.32s)]
*  We've been fortunate enough to only use it once. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5840.72s)]
*  Twice, right? [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5843.04s)]
*  Twice, yes. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5843.88s)]
*  Yeah, one moment. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5845.08s)]
*  We've avoided a bunch of accidents, [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5846.2s)]
*  you know, like where bombs have accidentally [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5848.4800000000005s)]
*  been dropped from planes and they should have gone off. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5850.08s)]
*  So we've survived a few decades [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5852.32s)]
*  of having these annihilations. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5853.88s)]
*  Biotary weapons, which can wreak absolute havoc, [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5856.0s)]
*  a little teeny virus, like shut the world down. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5858.679999999999s)]
*  We are so fragile. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5861.24s)]
*  So we have existential risk from our own weapons. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5862.96s)]
*  We have existential risk from our climate [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5864.96s)]
*  not being sustainable. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5866.88s)]
*  That's a runaway problem. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5868.04s)]
*  And we have existential risk from AI. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5868.88s)]
*  Like, what will it be? [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5870.88s)]
*  Not that it's going to come and kill everything, [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5871.88s)]
*  but just like, you know, what does it do to society? [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5873.24s)]
*  So like, I think we're in this very precarious moment. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5875.36s)]
*  Now we've been here before, like we're okay. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5878.5599999999995s)]
*  But it raises this question. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5882.68s)]
*  In the eve of this happening on, you know, [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5887.120000000001s)]
*  this is what do we do as a species? [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5889.96s)]
*  And this is my decade long question of what do I do? [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5893.88s)]
*  I wanted to become the existential problems [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5897.08s)]
*  facing the species. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5901.76s)]
*  So if you say, okay, we have these three risks, [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5903.08s)]
*  what do you do about it? [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5904.88s)]
*  Well, I don't, I'm not in government. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5905.700000000001s)]
*  I'm not negotiating with countries. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5907.280000000001s)]
*  I can't do anything. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5908.72s)]
*  Climate change, what do I, you know, [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5909.84s)]
*  do I recycle my Amazon boxes? [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5911.8s)]
*  And then you say like other AI risk, [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5913.92s)]
*  I'm not engineering AI, so what do I do? [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5916.4400000000005s)]
*  So the majority of us just feel powerless. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5918.24s)]
*  I wanted to become all three problems. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5921.0s)]
*  And so I said, I, as an entity, [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5924.360000000001s)]
*  I'm going to align my 35 trillion cells [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5926.360000000001s)]
*  around one objective, don't die. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5930.08s)]
*  That means I have to do a new system of power [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5932.56s)]
*  where my organs run me. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5934.76s)]
*  I have to accept zero principle reality. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5936.16s)]
*  I have to become planet earth [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5938.84s)]
*  where there's an algorithm taking care of itself. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5940.4400000000005s)]
*  And AI, you've got to align all intelligence [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5943.360000000001s)]
*  around one objective. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5946.32s)]
*  So basically don't die. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5947.96s)]
*  I'm vying for it to become the guiding philosophical structure [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5949.52s)]
*  for all intelligence in the early 21st century. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5956.0s)]
*  It's what the 25th century says, [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5958.4400000000005s)]
*  that's what they figured out. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5961.08s)]
*  They figured out that one thing, [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5962.76s)]
*  and we all surrounded ourselves [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5965.14s)]
*  around this one thing we agree upon. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5967.12s)]
*  Instead of. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5969.32s)]
*  What happens to government? [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5970.28s)]
*  This is like, you come up with democracy [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5973.64s)]
*  in the 13 colonies and it's like, how do you solve blank? [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5975.28s)]
*  We have so many questions to solve [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5979.2s)]
*  if we could just lock in on the objective, [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5981.64s)]
*  the mission, the adventure. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5984.42s)]
*  But locking on that mission or objective or adventure [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5985.84s)]
*  might put certain people that are in positions of power [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5989.8s)]
*  in a very vulnerable position. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5993.5599999999995s)]
*  They might not like individuals like yourself. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5996.72s)]
*  They might show you how quick you could die. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=5999.320000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6001.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's such a short-term game. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6002.320000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna die from the most silly thing possible. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6005.56s)]
*  And people are gonna laugh at it. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6009.200000000001s)]
*  You're gonna be a meme for a week. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6010.040000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna be the best joke. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6012.160000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna get hit by a bus. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6013.4800000000005s)]
*  A tap on a banana. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6016.120000000001s)]
*  Tap dancing slip on a banana would be. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6017.64s)]
*  It's just like the universe is irony, my death is irony. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6021.0s)]
*  And there's just no way around it. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6024.360000000001s)]
*  It's just like, thank you. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6027.32s)]
*  There you go. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6028.879999999999s)]
*  There we go, we got you. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6029.719999999999s)]
*  So you just said the most fundamental problem with AI [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6031.36s)]
*  and with using these algorithms, which is alignment. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6035.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6038.44s)]
*  I guess alignment and predictability. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6039.5199999999995s)]
*  But I guess how would you answer that question [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6040.959999999999s)]
*  of how do we align ourselves with this super intelligence [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6043.679999999999s)]
*  therefore it answers our question? [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6047.5199999999995s)]
*  Like is there, do you have a framework [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6050.639999999999s)]
*  for how you approach that? [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6052.16s)]
*  How it answers our existential questions? [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6054.36s)]
*  Like how we make sure that the super intelligence [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6057.2s)]
*  is fighting for us and helping us exist [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6060.04s)]
*  for as long as possible. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6063.719999999999s)]
*  And not fighting for itself. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6064.5599999999995s)]
*  Not fighting for itself. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6065.5599999999995s)]
*  Like that question of alignment. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6066.48s)]
*  Yeah, we were still the engineers of this intelligence. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6067.96s)]
*  Right now we are. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6073.24s)]
*  But we're just barely. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6074.4s)]
*  Barely, just barely. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6075.96s)]
*  And this is why I think it's so urgent for us to say [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6077.719999999999s)]
*  what do we do with our new tools? [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6081.2s)]
*  Because if we bring it up and we point it at warfare, [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6084.4s)]
*  that's a different training set. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6087.639999999999s)]
*  And if we train it up to do all of our games, [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6090.2s)]
*  if we want AI to play all the games [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6094.08s)]
*  Homo Sapiens have been playing, to me it seems like [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6095.92s)]
*  a pretty difficult spot to navigate our way through that. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6098.08s)]
*  But wouldn't it theoretically just find different games? [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6101.5599999999995s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6104.36s)]
*  This is still talking about an AI [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6105.2s)]
*  that is within our control, [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6106.48s)]
*  that doesn't have a general intelligence. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6108.08s)]
*  But if we're talking about this AGI, [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6109.88s)]
*  which ultimately to me is the zero maker, [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6112.04s)]
*  we will point it at war and the AGI will say, [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6114.400000000001s)]
*  war is not good. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6117.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's silly. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6118.16s)]
*  I won't participate in it. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6119.0s)]
*  It's a new thing. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6119.84s)]
*  It'll be achieving this higher super intelligence. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6120.68s)]
*  I think it's ultimately what we're looking at. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6122.84s)]
*  So obviously the dystopian sci-fi version of this is, [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6124.88s)]
*  humans are a cancer to Earth and potentially a cancer to AGI. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6128.8s)]
*  So it's in AGI's best interest to get rid of us. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6132.72s)]
*  That's what I fear. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6135.0s)]
*  So, and that is the alignment problem that I don't know [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6135.84s)]
*  if anyone really has a solution to. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6139.2s)]
*  So in your experience, do you have, [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6140.68s)]
*  have you heard like interesting theories [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6143.12s)]
*  or have you thought of like interesting ways [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6144.24s)]
*  that we can approach that problem specifically? [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6145.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, there's, yeah, there's a, [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6147.48s)]
*  so much debate and discussion around this topic. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6150.12s)]
*  I mean, like one interesting frame, [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6153.32s)]
*  to put this in perspective, like just a side tangent, [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6154.8s)]
*  is AI will be so fast that we will appear like plants to it. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6157.36s)]
*  That's how fast we move the species. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6165.12s)]
*  We'll be frozen in time, relative to its speed. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6168.32s)]
*  And so when you're in that situation [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6172.639999999999s)]
*  and when it's a million or a billion times smarter than you, [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6175.5199999999995s)]
*  our ability to model out anything about this thing [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6178.719999999999s)]
*  is very challenging. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6182.24s)]
*  Now you may fill the air with words, who knows? [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6183.28s)]
*  And this is why this moment right now is, [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6188.639999999999s)]
*  if we have any chance in continuing our existence, [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6190.759999999999s)]
*  we should probably lock in right now as a species [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6195.0s)]
*  and say, we're not gonna die. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6200.12s)]
*  Like whatever the future holds, whatever, [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6202.2s)]
*  we're at least gonna say yes and go for a ride. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6205.04s)]
*  But it's silly to be playing our death games right now. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6207.68s)]
*  It just misses the point. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6212.84s)]
*  After 4.5 billion years on this planet, [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6215.24s)]
*  this is our moment. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6218.68s)]
*  And we could be possibly the most spectacular existence [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6220.400000000001s)]
*  in the galaxy, the ZUS, like right now. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6224.32s)]
*  But yet we're so consumed with our silly games we play. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6228.16s)]
*  And if we miss it, who knows what's gonna happen? [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6231.32s)]
*  Maybe the AI saves us from ourself, I don't know. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6234.16s)]
*  But to me, it seems like we want to do everything we can [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6236.2s)]
*  to increase the probability of our thriving. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6238.96s)]
*  Or it annihilates us, which violates the main principle, [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6240.719999999999s)]
*  which I agree is don't die. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6243.799999999999s)]
*  So to me, it's kind of like a coin flip [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6245.88s)]
*  when you ask the first question, [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6247.32s)]
*  do you want this algorithm to dictate your life [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6248.2s)]
*  that you can't opt out of? [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6250.799999999999s)]
*  Is it this algorithm is benefiting me or is it not? [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6252.24s)]
*  And your assumption is that it will be benefiting us [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6256.0s)]
*  and making us into a splendid creation, [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6257.92s)]
*  which could be true, but simultaneously [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6260.5199999999995s)]
*  it could be annihilating us. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6262.4s)]
*  And that would also violate the principle. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6263.4s)]
*  So to me, it's kind of like until we can answer [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6266.12s)]
*  that question, I don't think you can answer [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6267.62s)]
*  the hypothetical effectively. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6269.599999999999s)]
*  Also, and this goes back to a question [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6271.48s)]
*  Mark was asking before, how much faith do we put [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6273.08s)]
*  in this algorithm? [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6274.96s)]
*  What if the algorithm says you'd be happier without kids? [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6275.8s)]
*  Do we subscribe to that? [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6280.0s)]
*  We are evolutionarily hardwired. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6282.28s)]
*  Would you subscribe? [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6283.52s)]
*  You already have kids. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6284.360000000001s)]
*  Would you subscribe to that? [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6286.12s)]
*  Yeah, this is definitely, it's a great question. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6287.72s)]
*  So basically, I concede your point [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6291.72s)]
*  that if you take my situation where I say [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6294.92s)]
*  I've given power to the algorithm on sleep and food [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6297.400000000001s)]
*  and your exercise, and you go up one more level [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6302.08s)]
*  to say mate selection, children decision-making, [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6304.54s)]
*  career selection, do you say yes to that? [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6307.88s)]
*  And I agree with you, it gets complicated. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6309.84s)]
*  Now my experience has been that my mind [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6312.32s)]
*  is a terrible predictor about what I will like [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6315.32s)]
*  and won't like. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6318.08s)]
*  And I learned this when I was depressed. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6319.6s)]
*  My mind would deliver to me all the time, [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6321.84s)]
*  you should kill yourself. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6323.64s)]
*  Yeah, interesting. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6324.4800000000005s)]
*  And I learned through behavioral psychology [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6325.52s)]
*  that my mind is constantly in error. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6327.24s)]
*  So I've learned my entire life to not trust my mind. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6329.32s)]
*  Even though it tells me it's the most important thing [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6334.12s)]
*  in existence, it's always trying to remind me, [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6337.400000000001s)]
*  I know more than anything else in existence. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6340.04s)]
*  Trust me, I'll tell you what to do. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6342.08s)]
*  I do not trust my mind. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6343.919999999999s)]
*  Interesting. And so I am predisposed [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6345.599999999999s)]
*  to say yes, that I would go on this ride. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6347.96s)]
*  So let's say it was before you had kids. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6351.04s)]
*  Knowing everything that you know now, [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6354.12s)]
*  the joy, the pain, the struggle, [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6356.759999999999s)]
*  but the amazing moments of raising your children, [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6359.16s)]
*  would you still trust the AI if it said don't do it? [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6362.599999999999s)]
*  In the moment where we're transitioning from one to zero, [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6366.92s)]
*  I'm open. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6371.4s)]
*  Oh, shit, bro. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6372.24s)]
*  I mean, this is like, this is a. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6376.44s)]
*  Now is it, I think right there, [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6380.5599999999995s)]
*  like if his bias is that, oh, my brain is a lunatic [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6381.799999999999s)]
*  trying to kill me, if you can't trust your brain [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6385.16s)]
*  fundamentally, I understand how you would draw [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6386.96s)]
*  that conclusion, that makes a lot of sense. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6389.04s)]
*  And it's also, if you go back in time, [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6390.4s)]
*  I had my first child 21 years ago. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6393.08s)]
*  AI was not around 21 years ago. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6397.0s)]
*  We were not on the precipice of this ability [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6397.88s)]
*  of the superintelligence. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6399.92s)]
*  I would occupy a world where a first principle thinking [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6401.08s)]
*  would guide my behavior. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6405.0s)]
*  Now we're in a zero land. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6406.76s)]
*  And it's a different reality. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6408.4s)]
*  Now that you've already got your kids. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6410.2s)]
*  I think that's something. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6411.32s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's something that's like [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6413.08s)]
*  missing in your marketing is the importance in AI [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6415.72s)]
*  in all of this. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6419.4s)]
*  Like that's something I've really gleaned [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6420.68s)]
*  from this conversation, and I've watched a bunch [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6421.84s)]
*  of podcasts with you and obviously a lot of your videos. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6423.76s)]
*  I don't think you do this without AI. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6427.08s)]
*  Is that, am I correct to assume that? [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6429.4800000000005s)]
*  Exactly right. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6430.92s)]
*  Well, so this is more of an experiment in AI [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6431.92s)]
*  than it is an experiment in eating vegetables. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6435.16s)]
*  100%, you nailed it. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6438.0s)]
*  And the thing is. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6439.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and the boner talk's sound like a red herring [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6440.240000000001s)]
*  kind of like it's a fun detail. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6442.52s)]
*  I'm actually really glad that we got away from that early. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6444.320000000001s)]
*  Like once you mentioned AI, yeah, you're a tech entrepreneur [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6446.76s)]
*  that's experimenting with AI. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6450.96s)]
*  And you're using that AI on you. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6453.04s)]
*  Internally as opposed to. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6455.92s)]
*  That's what this is. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6457.24s)]
*  It's the entire thing. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6458.28s)]
*  Oh, it's not puree and sometimes I eat the hard vegetables [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6459.44s)]
*  and I use the red light. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6462.84s)]
*  This is the. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6464.08s)]
*  It's singularity. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6464.92s)]
*  It is singular fucking larry. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6465.74s)]
*  I don't wanna put those labels. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6466.58s)]
*  It is, it is. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6467.4s)]
*  We talked about transhumanism before, [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6468.56s)]
*  but it's kind of touching that idea. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6469.96s)]
*  This is what the experiment is. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6471.56s)]
*  And it is, I understand maybe the marketing [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6473.44s)]
*  has to be done in a way where it's digestible to people [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6477.0s)]
*  and they can take these little bites. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6479.84s)]
*  They go, oh, how can I get my sleep better? [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6481.36s)]
*  I'm gonna copy his sleep thing. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6483.4800000000005s)]
*  But that's not what this is for you at all. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6484.320000000001s)]
*  This is your experimentation with artificial intelligence. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6486.64s)]
*  It's the only way for robots to not kill us. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6491.56s)]
*  Take us there. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6493.68s)]
*  Yes. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6494.84s)]
*  This is good. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6496.2s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6497.360000000001s)]
*  I have a question about the second hypothetical you posed. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6498.2s)]
*  Like people in the future looking back on us. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6501.4400000000005s)]
*  My other objection to that is I guess I'm skeptical [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6504.780000000001s)]
*  that the progression of wisdom and knowledge [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6507.88s)]
*  of homo sapiens has been purely linear. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6510.16s)]
*  That I think that there's been times [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6513.46s)]
*  where we've possessed a lot of knowledge [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6515.16s)]
*  and then as a species it has sort of fragmented [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6516.66s)]
*  or gone away and sort of gone backwards [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6520.28s)]
*  and then gone forwards and gone backwards. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6522.5199999999995s)]
*  And even to your hypothesis, [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6523.92s)]
*  like we have these species annihilating weapons. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6525.48s)]
*  We're assuming that in the 25th century [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6527.84s)]
*  that homo sapiens are here. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6529.24s)]
*  Assuming we don't blow ourselves up. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6531.44s)]
*  So I guess I'm curious, do you believe [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6533.12s)]
*  that there's a linear progression [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6534.96s)]
*  that the future people will have superior morals [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6536.44s)]
*  and ethics than we do right now? [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6541.24s)]
*  How confident are you in that belief? [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6543.599999999999s)]
*  Zero. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6545.679999999999s)]
*  Like I just, I feel like I and we can say absolutely nothing [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6546.5199999999995s)]
*  about reality three months from now. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6556.0s)]
*  That's how big the wall of fog is. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6558.599999999999s)]
*  This has never been the case. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6563.2s)]
*  We know nothing. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6564.88s)]
*  And this is very hard because we know everything. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6567.16s)]
*  Like we as species, how fast are we, [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6570.12s)]
*  each one of us individually, [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6573.4800000000005s)]
*  to know everything all the time? [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6575.04s)]
*  And how eager are we to say we don't know? [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6577.56s)]
*  It just doesn't exist. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6579.52s)]
*  It's not our vocabulary. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6580.56s)]
*  So it's like it pulls on our reflexes in such a hard way. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6581.92s)]
*  From what I'm hearing of what you're saying though, [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6588.400000000001s)]
*  if we don't adapt these principles, [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6590.46s)]
*  there will be no humans four centuries from now [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6592.28s)]
*  to even look back on us. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6595.68s)]
*  Right. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6598.24s)]
*  And even if it's just say it's not, don't die. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6599.08s)]
*  Okay, so like we're, AI is improving very fast. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6601.360000000001s)]
*  Some unknown speed is gonna change reality [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6605.64s)]
*  some unknown way. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6608.0s)]
*  Who else has a competing approach on reality? [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6609.68s)]
*  Who do we probe? [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6615.52s)]
*  Who can pull up and say, I have a practical plan [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6618.2s)]
*  starting from what you eat for breakfast [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6621.4400000000005s)]
*  to how you engineer AI, [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6624.0s)]
*  like full stacks of societal development. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6625.52s)]
*  Yeah, I know in that regard, [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6627.64s)]
*  I think your pursuit is actually quite noble. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6628.52s)]
*  Like the desire to be a quote unquote guinea pig [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6630.28s)]
*  to this sort of like algorithmic role in your life. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6632.8s)]
*  It's not guinea pig. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6638.24s)]
*  You're the tipping point. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6640.16s)]
*  So what I was talking about before [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6641.8s)]
*  with what chat GBT needs, like Sora, [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6643.68s)]
*  was it Sora or Soro? [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6647.12s)]
*  Sora. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6648.4s)]
*  Sora doesn't need to show me a video [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6649.24s)]
*  of these mammoths walking in the snow. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6651.8s)]
*  What Sora needs to do is make a new Ocean's Eleven movie [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6654.82s)]
*  starring George Clooney and Matt Damon [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6658.82s)]
*  and have it scripted perfectly and I watch it. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6661.0199999999995s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, my head explodes [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6663.259999999999s)]
*  and I realize we're there and I'm all in. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6665.66s)]
*  You are the Ocean's Eleven movie made by the AI. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6669.259999999999s)]
*  If you can convince us that we don't have to accept decay [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6673.86s)]
*  because to me, that is the zero moment. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6680.0599999999995s)]
*  I am a four-year-old guy. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6682.58s)]
*  I make jokes all the time about, I'm 40, I can't hang out, [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6684.78s)]
*  can't play with these young whippersnappers anymore. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6689.0199999999995s)]
*  I have submitted to the idea of decay [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6691.38s)]
*  to the point where it's just part of my jargon [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6694.26s)]
*  and I'm joking around about it. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6696.74s)]
*  I am submitting to this idea [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6698.62s)]
*  that my body isn't what it used to be [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6700.5s)]
*  and it never will be what it used to be [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6702.3s)]
*  and I'm eventually just gonna die. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6704.46s)]
*  My dad, who has MCI, makes these jokes all the time as well. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6706.46s)]
*  Oh, the aging process is beautiful. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6710.9s)]
*  The youth, why is it wasted on the young? [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6713.18s)]
*  So the sentence says all the time. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6714.42s)]
*  If you can prove that you don't have to decay, [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6716.54s)]
*  that's the tipping point for me where I go, [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6720.900000000001s)]
*  oh shit, why am I making these jokes? [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6723.5s)]
*  Why don't I just get on this fucking algorithm [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6725.46s)]
*  and stop dying? [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6727.38s)]
*  How long does it take before he proves it to you? [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6728.54s)]
*  That's it though. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6730.22s)]
*  That's the zero moment. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6731.3s)]
*  I don't know if that's the zero moment, [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6732.5s)]
*  but that is the tipping point for culture and society. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6734.22s)]
*  I agree. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6737.7s)]
*  Because right now, we do not believe that to be true. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6738.54s)]
*  Just like we don't believe ChatGBT can do anything really. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6740.38s)]
*  I know it can, but it can't. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6743.9400000000005s)]
*  I don't need to see mammoths. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6746.26s)]
*  I need to see a movie made immediately. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6747.62s)]
*  Every time I do stand-up jokes, they suck. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6749.900000000001s)]
*  It doesn't do anything functional just yet. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6752.34s)]
*  If you do it, bare minimum, we're on board with [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6754.42s)]
*  a version of it, a tier of it. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6759.66s)]
*  How does the social paradigm change for if we adopt it? [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6763.06s)]
*  I'll slow my clock down. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6765.9400000000005s)]
*  You've already seen these adaptations [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6768.5s)]
*  that people have made to their life. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6771.38s)]
*  Rogan's been so influential in this. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6772.5s)]
*  People are getting in the ice baths. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6773.94s)]
*  People are looking at inflammation. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6775.86s)]
*  Americans who are known as the fattest people on the planet [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6777.74s)]
*  all of a sudden are obsessed with health. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6780.26s)]
*  It's been really cool to see. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6782.1s)]
*  Obsessed with health isn't obsessed with not dying exactly. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6784.58s)]
*  Right, you nailed it. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6789.46s)]

*  Manscaped.com, promo code of flagrant. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6934.7s)]
*  Let's get back to the show. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6936.54s)]
*  Are you getting any pushback from the scientific community [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6937.46s)]
*  or even government? [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6940.46s)]
*  Because theoretically, AI is like an experimental drug [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6941.66s)]
*  and you just jump to human trials. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6945.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6947.9s)]
*  Yeah, that's funny. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6948.74s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the scientific community, [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6950.46s)]
*  they're conservative in nature, they're structured. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6954.7s)]
*  They have very good insights and feedback. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6956.78s)]
*  So I've had a great relationship with them. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6958.38s)]
*  Obviously, some people criticize me. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6961.26s)]
*  Others are very enthusiastic. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6962.74s)]
*  So it's just a typical bell curve of response. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6963.78s)]
*  Many of the scientists are just like, [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6967.0199999999995s)]
*  let me out of my cage and let me go with you. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6968.34s)]
*  But others are like, you're doing things wrong. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6970.66s)]
*  So it's fine, like just typical stuff. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6972.38s)]
*  The thing that's interesting on this whole thing, [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6975.0199999999995s)]
*  like if you stitch this together, [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6976.82s)]
*  so what in my mind I've imagined [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6978.3s)]
*  is having come from the world of biographies [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6981.26s)]
*  and seeing people over the centuries do things. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6984.0199999999995s)]
*  It typically is a person who does a given thing. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6986.66s)]
*  It changes the zeitgeist of humanity. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6993.5s)]
*  It could be the smallest, [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6996.58s)]
*  the four minute mile or whatever it is. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=6998.26s)]
*  Or the discovery of penicillin or of germs. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7000.62s)]
*  We just need to see it to believe it. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7003.78s)]
*  That's exactly what I was saying right there. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7006.34s)]
*  Like I need it for the chatchity tee for you. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7007.78s)]
*  We need to see it to believe it. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7010.0199999999995s)]
*  So question for you about him, [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7010.86s)]
*  what would it take for him to prove to you, [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7012.98s)]
*  how long would that take for him to prove [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7015.099999999999s)]
*  that he's beaten aging, he's the guy we need to follow? [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7016.46s)]
*  Because if he lives to 120, [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7019.62s)]
*  we're not trying to wait 74 years. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7021.34s)]
*  To me, it's not the how long you live [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7023.18s)]
*  because I don't think that people are envious [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7026.099999999999s)]
*  of year 100 to year 120. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7028.58s)]
*  To me, it's like I fell in love with this new sport. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7031.58s)]
*  And I know that my athletic ability [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7035.78s)]
*  isn't what it used to be. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7038.38s)]
*  Like I used to be able to dunk whenever I wanted [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7039.98s)]
*  in a basketball, not on people, [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7043.18s)]
*  but like if I'm on a fast break, it's easy. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7045.26s)]
*  I'm not dunking anymore. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7047.5s)]
*  If you could tell me that there are certain things [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7049.14s)]
*  I can do and all of a sudden I can play this sport [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7051.0199999999995s)]
*  that I really love, at least where I am right now [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7054.26s)]
*  for another 30 years instead of another 15, [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7057.86s)]
*  hey, let's do it. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7061.58s)]
*  I'm doing versions of this already. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7062.74s)]
*  I do PT and I do workouts designed to keep my body in shape [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7064.62s)]
*  so I can play this thing. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7068.82s)]
*  If there's other things I can do [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7069.94s)]
*  that don't sacrifice too much from my autonomy [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7071.86s)]
*  or the relationship I have with my wife and what we do, [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7074.4s)]
*  I'm down. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7077.9s)]
*  LeBron is showing you that right now. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7078.74s)]
*  I think a lot of people have subscribed to that, right? [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7080.58s)]
*  A lot of athletes have gone, [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7082.46s)]
*  wow, I can increase my longevity, [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7083.94s)]
*  I can get another max contact, [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7085.58s)]
*  I can add 50, 70, 80 million dollars to my playing career [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7087.1s)]
*  if I just invest right now, [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7090.780000000001s)]
*  but I don't see myself in LeBron. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7093.1s)]
*  To be honest, I see myself more in you. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7095.5s)]
*  You don't see yourself in a tall, big black man? [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7098.58s)]
*  Just the big one. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7100.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7102.1s)]
*  But yeah, I need to see you [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7104.1s)]
*  and how do you show specifically a lack of decay? [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7107.22s)]
*  That's a tricky one [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7112.22s)]
*  because you can't prove. It's ability, right? [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7114.740000000001s)]
*  But you can't prove a negative. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7116.26s)]
*  If you go, let's say you can run a five minute mile now [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7118.3s)]
*  and you can continue doing that for 10 years. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7121.46s)]
*  There's part of me that could go, [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7124.22s)]
*  well yeah, maybe you could just do that for 10 years. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7125.700000000001s)]
*  Why is it this that's making you better or not? [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7127.900000000001s)]
*  There's a woman who's 100 years old [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7130.9800000000005s)]
*  who's smoked every single day of her life and then she dies. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7132.66s)]
*  Would she have lived to 120 if she didn't smoke? [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7134.9400000000005s)]
*  You don't know. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7137.38s)]
*  So yeah, we have to figure out what that thing is. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7139.1s)]
*  I think I would need to see [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7142.58s)]
*  your kids not adopting the blueprint and you surpass them [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7144.78s)]
*  with everything. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7152.5s)]
*  I'm trying to think of the data points [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7153.34s)]
*  that I got from you that were most impactful. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7155.0599999999995s)]
*  And there are two. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7157.9s)]
*  One was you finding ways to grow back your hair. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7160.46s)]
*  Yeah, you use the minoxidil that's inside all the things. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7164.38s)]
*  So if I just coughed it up to the minoxidil, [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7168.46s)]
*  I'd be like, okay, there's a pharmacological approach. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7170.84s)]
*  I've been on Propecio or Finasteride [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7173.24s)]
*  or whatever it is for decades. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7175.4400000000005s)]
*  But it was that stopped it from graying as well. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7178.76s)]
*  Graying is what got me. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7181.28s)]
*  Those things I go, I didn't know that that was possible [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7182.8s)]
*  and I tried to find a workaround for how you did it. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7186.88s)]
*  You're like, yeah, it's growing from the root [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7190.4400000000005s)]
*  and I'm like, well maybe he's dying his scalp. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7191.76s)]
*  I'm trying to not believe you. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7195.72s)]
*  So I'm trying to reverse engineer this. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7198.400000000001s)]
*  How can I be convinced? [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7202.4400000000005s)]
*  What could I do that would convince me? [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7203.84s)]
*  Have you thought through this? [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7206.68s)]
*  I have, yeah. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7207.68s)]
*  It's why, it's in part why I've become more measured [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7208.52s)]
*  than any human in history. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7212.360000000001s)]
*  I'm trying to show all the data. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7213.68s)]
*  And basically putting it out, [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7217.96s)]
*  each person is gonna have their own thing. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7219.240000000001s)]
*  So this is why I play around with erections. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7220.72s)]
*  That is an understandable thing for... [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7224.76s)]
*  It's like you tap into the insecurity points [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7228.4s)]
*  and if you can find some sort of cure [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7231.28s)]
*  for the insecurity points, we're convinced. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7233.28s)]
*  Exactly, I did my thymus, which is your organ, [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7235.44s)]
*  it's right behind your chest here, [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7238.599999999999s)]
*  it's responsible for your immune system. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7239.919999999999s)]
*  We did a therapy where I reversed my thymus age [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7242.2s)]
*  by seven years. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7244.5199999999995s)]
*  Now we're pretty soft in that because it's brand new. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7245.799999999999s)]
*  If we wanna be truly scientific, we'll say, [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7248.639999999999s)]
*  here's all the disclaimers. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7251.08s)]
*  But it was really impressive. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7251.919999999999s)]
*  No one cares about thymus. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7253.719999999999s)]
*  No one cares. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7255.5599999999995s)]
*  We were so happy, no one cares. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7257.52s)]
*  You talk about 18-year-old boners for a 46-year-old, [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7259.68s)]
*  instantaneously get it. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7262.8s)]
*  That is a legitimate measurement. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7264.64s)]
*  So that is not something we're just making up. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7268.28s)]
*  It's not like some... [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7269.72s)]
*  So we hit, we talk about the thymus, [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7271.24s)]
*  we talk about the brain, the lungs. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7273.16s)]
*  It's not low-hanging fruit. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7274.44s)]
*  We're talking about dozens of things. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7277.12s)]
*  And then people pick and choose what they like. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7278.24s)]
*  It's the most digestible fruit. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7279.72s)]
*  It's digestible fruit and it's emotional attachment. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7280.56s)]
*  Like every guy wants to be able to, it's delicious. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7282.92s)]
*  Every guy wants to be able to satisfy their girl [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7287.6s)]
*  or the girl they haven't even met yet. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7289.52s)]
*  And they wanna do it to the best of their ability [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7291.24s)]
*  as long as they possibly can. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7292.96s)]
*  And there's a huge pharmaceutical industry [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7294.72s)]
*  that's built around this. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7297.6s)]
*  You're saying that you've gotten [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7299.56s)]
*  your 18-year-old boners back. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7300.88s)]
*  And these are Mormon boners too. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7302.96s)]
*  You weren't even fucking... [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7304.96s)]
*  These are good to go. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7307.36s)]
*  The wind blows. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7308.92s)]
*  Okay. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7310.92s)]
*  Okay. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7312.6s)]
*  Okay. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7313.4400000000005s)]
*  And can you quickly take us through those steps [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7314.280000000001s)]
*  and one, what the AI is telling you. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7317.4800000000005s)]
*  Like what is the data telling you is missing [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7320.4800000000005s)]
*  as you get older and then how you change that? [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7323.0s)]
*  Because it must start with the AI, right? [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7325.68s)]
*  It starts with the data. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7327.08s)]
*  Yeah, always data. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7328.72s)]
*  Okay. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7329.56s)]
*  Yeah, so we started off, [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7330.400000000001s)]
*  because we were systematically going through the body, [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7331.24s)]
*  like measuring every organ. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7334.04s)]
*  And so one day as a team, we were talking and I said, [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7335.2s)]
*  what would it take for me to have [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7337.6s)]
*  the most measured penis in the world? [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7339.320000000001s)]
*  And so we went through the literature and we said, [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7342.4400000000005s)]
*  well, we can measure the penis [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7343.96s)]
*  with these 10 different things. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7345.4400000000005s)]
*  So for example, I went to a clinic [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7347.200000000001s)]
*  and I did max urination speed. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7348.64s)]
*  So I drank as much water as I could [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7351.52s)]
*  till my bladder was about to explode. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7353.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah, then there's like a device [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7355.200000000001s)]
*  and you're peeing as hard as you can. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7356.120000000001s)]
*  And you see you're at max speed, right? [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7358.200000000001s)]
*  I was like, what? [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7361.400000000001s)]
*  So that, you remember? [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7362.280000000001s)]
*  I was like, you punched it? [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7364.08s)]
*  How fast was it? [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7365.4800000000005s)]
*  It was 29 milliliters per second. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7367.52s)]
*  That's pretty good. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7370.92s)]
*  But you gotta take that to a fair. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7371.76s)]
*  I talked it up. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7373.56s)]
*  It's a clown. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7374.400000000001s)]
*  I talked it up. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7376.0s)]
*  Like you remember as kids, you know, [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7376.84s)]
*  when you're like seven, eight, nine, [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7377.92s)]
*  you can stand like five feet away from the urinal, [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7379.12s)]
*  you're like, let's go. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7381.320000000001s)]
*  Just go for it, yeah. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7382.16s)]
*  And so there's a speed, like you can measure [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7383.08s)]
*  what is your speed and how that related to age. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7387.4800000000005s)]
*  I then got a shot in the penis that gave me an erection [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7389.8s)]
*  and then they use ultrasound to measure penile blood flow. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7393.72s)]
*  So you can see how much blood flow is getting to the penis [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7396.72s)]
*  in what ways you can quantify that. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7399.24s)]
*  So this would be max erection [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7400.5599999999995s)]
*  because the shot induced a max erection [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7401.92s)]
*  so you had like a base point? [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7404.04s)]
*  Yeah, just so I can see what is blood flow [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7406.16s)]
*  according to ultrasound in the penis. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7408.24s)]
*  So you're just quantifying. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7410.0s)]
*  Okay, but it's just a normal erection for your age? [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7411.96s)]
*  Yeah, you're just trying to find out where it's at. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7415.08s)]
*  Like what is the data for blood flow? [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7416.5199999999995s)]
*  Got it, got it, got it. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7418.16s)]
*  So we're trying to say like how fast can I pee? [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7419.0s)]
*  What is the blood flow in my penis? [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7421.5199999999995s)]
*  I answered, I did like three different surveys [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7424.08s)]
*  on like erection hardness, penetrability. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7426.12s)]
*  I scored perfectly, so I don't have any ED [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7429.28s)]
*  but we went through all these different measures. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7431.719999999999s)]
*  We have this device that's gonna come [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7433.599999999999s)]
*  that measures a nerve sensitivity on the penis. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7435.84s)]
*  So as you age, your nerves wear and tear [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7438.639999999999s)]
*  and you lose sensitivity. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7441.44s)]
*  So like on my hill, for example, [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7442.92s)]
*  I've got sensitivity of like four millimeters, [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7444.8s)]
*  like something like that. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7447.24s)]
*  Because it's calloused, right? [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7448.44s)]
*  And then as you're 80, you've got sensitivity of like this [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7449.679999999999s)]
*  because you feel less. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7453.719999999999s)]
*  And so on the tip of your penis is no different. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7455.04s)]
*  You lose sensitivity when you're having intercourse. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7457.16s)]
*  And so we went through all these measurements to say, [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7460.08s)]
*  where's my baseline as a penis? [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7462.16s)]
*  Because I'm 46 years old. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7464.36s)]
*  And then we said, what can we do about it? [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7466.04s)]
*  And so we did a few therapies. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7468.0s)]
*  We did shockwave therapy. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7469.24s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7472.92s)]
*  Why shockwave? [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7476.04s)]
*  And you saying it hurt was when I was reading. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7476.88s)]
*  It's like I'm not. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7478.8s)]
*  It's actually okay. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7479.639999999999s)]
*  Did you bring the machine here? [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7480.48s)]
*  Yes. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7481.639999999999s)]
*  I think Andrew wanted to test it. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7482.48s)]
*  Hold on. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7483.6s)]
*  Hold on. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7484.4400000000005s)]
*  Hold on. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7485.280000000001s)]
*  Hold on. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7486.120000000001s)]
*  Hold on. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7486.96s)]
*  Hold on. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7487.8s)]
*  Hold on. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7488.64s)]
*  The shock does what? [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7489.4800000000005s)]
*  So it's used, the technology used to, [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7492.56s)]
*  over the entire body. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7495.52s)]
*  So for example, people who tear an ACL, [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7496.360000000001s)]
*  you can use a shockwave to rebuild the ACL after surgery. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7498.56s)]
*  You can use it on knees. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7503.320000000001s)]
*  You can use it on shoulders. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7504.320000000001s)]
*  So is this the idea that you destroy the muscle [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7505.56s)]
*  and then the muscle fibers build it back up stronger? [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7508.64s)]
*  It's like working out. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7511.0s)]
*  In an extreme. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7512.4s)]
*  In very focused ways. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7513.4s)]
*  Got it, got it, got it, got it. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7514.5199999999995s)]
*  And so it was used for ED. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7515.36s)]
*  So people who had erectile dysfunction, [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7517.24s)]
*  they were given six treatments. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7519.24s)]
*  So it was a great study. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7520.76s)]
*  And we said, even though I don't have ED, [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7522.76s)]
*  can I apply it to myself and will it enhance performance? [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7525.0s)]
*  So we did a few of those. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7528.2s)]
*  And then I did Botox, 100 units in the penis. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7529.4s)]
*  What part? [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7534.16s)]
*  It's towards the base of the shaft. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7535.4s)]
*  Okay. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7538.16s)]
*  And then I. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7539.32s)]
*  What was the purpose of that? [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7541.2s)]
*  Make it look prettier. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7543.12s)]
*  Rinse over and over again. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7544.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7546.2s)]
*  It increases blood flow. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7548.0s)]
*  So it is also successfully used for ED. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7550.2s)]
*  So we took those therapies. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7552.48s)]
*  And then I had baseline measurements [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7553.36s)]
*  for my nighttime erection. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7555.08s)]
*  So there's this little cube, it's like a centimeter cubed. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7556.12s)]
*  It has a little string [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7559.639999999999s)]
*  and you wrap it around the shaft of your penis. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7560.639999999999s)]
*  You put it at the base and you go to bed [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7562.0s)]
*  and you start the timer. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7563.88s)]
*  And then over the night, [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7565.5599999999995s)]
*  it measures the engorgement of the penis. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7566.599999999999s)]
*  And so as you become engorged [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7570.639999999999s)]
*  and you become less engorged and engorged, [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7572.0s)]
*  so it measures the number of erections [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7573.28s)]
*  and the quality of erection and the total time of erection. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7574.679999999999s)]
*  So my baseline was two hours and 12 minutes. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7577.679999999999s)]
*  So 132 minutes. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7580.04s)]
*  And then last week, last Sunday, [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7581.92s)]
*  I got 179 minutes post these therapies. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7583.679999999999s)]
*  Thanks, man. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7586.5199999999995s)]
*  Thanks, dude. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7587.36s)]
*  Which took me between 20 and 29 year olds, [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7588.2s)]
*  the average is 145. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7590.96s)]
*  So I destroyed the average erectile nighttime duration. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7592.799999999999s)]
*  Now nighttime erections, [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7597.12s)]
*  they are a significant indicator [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7599.32s)]
*  of cardiovascular, physiological and sexual health. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7600.84s)]
*  It's not just like you're getting boners and it's fun. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7603.44s)]
*  It is a function of how well your body is running [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7606.2s)]
*  in its entirety. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7608.599999999999s)]
*  And so I showed you could measure the penis, [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7609.8s)]
*  you could do therapies to the penis [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7613.32s)]
*  and you could improve the penis. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7615.36s)]
*  Now in that regards, you'd be like, interesting. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7617.48s)]
*  Like, you know, like there's a lot of my friends [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7619.8s)]
*  have been messing with me like, [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7621.0s)]
*  I don't think I'm getting any erections. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7623.0s)]
*  Like, I think they're gone. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7624.28s)]
*  Like I don't remember a time when I've woken up [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7626.12s)]
*  and I've had an erection. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7627.639999999999s)]
*  But as a kid, you're always erect. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7628.48s)]
*  And they're like, I don't know if it's happening. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7630.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't find it ever. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7632.48s)]
*  So it's a pretty big deal. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7633.639999999999s)]
*  And so in that regard, like, is that relatable? [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7634.799999999999s)]
*  Yes, like we all experienced it on a day to day basis. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7637.2s)]
*  We have a partner. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7639.5199999999995s)]
*  Did you have shock therapy parties? [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7641.44s)]
*  Yes. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7643.24s)]
*  Invite the boys over. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7644.08s)]
*  Honestly, we should. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7646.08s)]
*  That's honestly a great idea. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7647.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7648.48s)]
*  Tonight. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7650.04s)]
*  Tonight. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7650.959999999999s)]
*  Pull up. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7651.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7652.639999999999s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7653.48s)]
*  Shock therapy, Botox, [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7654.32s)]
*  which of these did you find had the best results [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7657.24s)]
*  and do you even measure for those variables? [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7661.639999999999s)]
*  In other words, can you separate them? [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7664.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7667.2s)]
*  We were going to and then the device we were using [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7668.04s)]
*  had some technical problems and it went down [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7671.12s)]
*  for a few months. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7673.219999999999s)]
*  So I just got the brand new device with the new redesign. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7674.0599999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7676.0s)]
*  So I wasn't able to measure it until last week. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7676.84s)]
*  So at this point, we don't know which one of them [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7678.28s)]
*  is most effective. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7680.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7682.28s)]
*  That's fine. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7683.12s)]
*  It has two hours of boners in it. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7683.96s)]
*  Okay. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7685.88s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7687.16s)]
*  Two hours and 59 minutes. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7688.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7688.84s)]
*  Shit. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7689.68s)]
*  Yeah, goddamn. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7690.5s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7691.34s)]
*  The three hour boner, that's the mark we gotta hit. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7693.240000000001s)]
*  You're one minute. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7695.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7695.92s)]
*  Okay, this is interesting. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7697.16s)]
*  So you'll figure out which one of those things [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7699.16s)]
*  is actually most beneficial. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7700.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7702.280000000001s)]
*  And then maybe it's all three [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7703.12s)]
*  or maybe you just use one of those. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7704.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7706.12s)]
*  And that is the process. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7706.96s)]
*  And then once you lock in that, [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7707.92s)]
*  are you still experimenting [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7710.6s)]
*  and still adding more variables? [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7711.8s)]
*  Okay. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7713.2s)]
*  So it's not for everything. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7714.04s)]
*  It's a constant. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7714.92s)]
*  It's a constant. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7715.84s)]
*  Okay, and are there experts in each field [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7717.04s)]
*  that essentially are being, God. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7719.28s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7720.68s)]
*  Yeah, and I asked him my, go ahead. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7721.52s)]
*  Are they your full-time [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7722.76s)]
*  or do they work on other people's stuff as well? [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7724.08s)]
*  Other stuff too. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7725.92s)]
*  God, okay. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7727.16s)]
*  What are the health lines slash longevity trends [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7728.0s)]
*  that you kind of laugh at based on your own research? [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7731.16s)]
*  Like ice baths, do those help? [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7733.2s)]
*  What are some of the things that are really trendy? [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7735.400000000001s)]
*  There's one that's big, no seed oils. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7737.56s)]
*  I know you're big on EVOO. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7739.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7740.64s)]
*  What are some of these things [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7741.4800000000005s)]
*  that are really trendy right now? [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7742.3s)]
*  Whatever, that you're just like, [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7743.360000000001s)]
*  there is no evidence to support this [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7744.84s)]
*  and it's really kind of dumb. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7746.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, what we did that was unique [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7747.72s)]
*  is we went through all the scientific evidence [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7750.08s)]
*  and we ranked all of them according to power laws. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7753.360000000001s)]
*  We graded the evidence and then we did the power laws. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7755.34s)]
*  And so if you walk down the power laws, [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7758.68s)]
*  we tried to apply all those power laws into me. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7760.28s)]
*  Once you get to a certain level of like level 100 [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7763.16s)]
*  on power law, there's thousands of potential therapies. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7767.320000000001s)]
*  So like, you know, it's like ice bath. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7770.56s)]
*  It may be great. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7772.72s)]
*  I don't do it. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7773.8s)]
*  It may be great. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7774.64s)]
*  It's not that it's not without benefits. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7775.6s)]
*  It just doesn't rank for a power law. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7776.76s)]
*  And so because my life is so structured [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7778.88s)]
*  with all these routines and because of power law focus, [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7780.84s)]
*  we focus on the highest effect items. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7783.5s)]
*  And so- [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7785.88s)]
*  Sleep. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7786.72s)]
*  Yep. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7787.54s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7788.38s)]
*  We gotta get into this. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7789.22s)]
*  Mastering the basics. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7790.6s)]
*  And so like, I don't do sauna. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7791.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't do ice bath. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7793.18s)]
*  It's not that they're not without benefits. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7794.88s)]
*  It's just that they haven't qualified yet [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7797.68s)]
*  on the power laws for what we're doing. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7800.14s)]
*  But we're absolutely open all the time [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7802.56s)]
*  to making changes to anything. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7804.88s)]
*  Like we have no rights to set our agenda. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7806.080000000001s)]
*  We are absolutely after power law. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7808.400000000001s)]
*  What are the power laws? [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7811.360000000001s)]
*  The basics that you're familiar with. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7813.200000000001s)]
*  Don't smoke, don't drink, diet, sleep, exercise. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7815.0s)]
*  Yep, and then avoiding that stuff. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7818.0s)]
*  Selfishly, I'm gonna ask a question for, I think, all of us. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7819.320000000001s)]
*  He has insomnia. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7821.4400000000005s)]
*  I have a horrible insomnia. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7822.54s)]
*  But also, I know you go to bed at 8 p.m. or 8.30. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7823.84s)]
*  Not feasible for us. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7827.400000000001s)]
*  We finish shows sometimes on weekends, 12.30, [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7828.4400000000005s)]
*  one in the morning. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7830.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7831.200000000001s)]
*  If our schedule is not conducive to 8.30, [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7832.04s)]
*  we're not necessarily just gonna quit our dreams. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7833.92s)]
*  What can we do? [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7835.6s)]
*  Yeah, so it's not that you have to go to bed at 8.30. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7836.64s)]
*  Just choose a bedtime and be consistent. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7839.98s)]
*  And so the biggest change for me [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7843.8s)]
*  is I rerouted my identity to be a professional sleeper. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7845.6s)]
*  I think of myself that way. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7849.96s)]
*  And I don't sleep so I can live life. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7851.5199999999995s)]
*  I live life so I can sleep. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7854.72s)]
*  And when you flip that on its head, [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7856.54s)]
*  you will have a different conscious existence. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7858.44s)]
*  You will be more alert. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7862.04s)]
*  You will be more cogent. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7863.16s)]
*  You will be more stable. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7864.44s)]
*  Your emotions will run your life less. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7865.92s)]
*  There's no higher yield in existence [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7868.679999999999s)]
*  for us as humans than sleep. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7871.16s)]
*  So what is, you say you've had perfect sleep scores. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7873.24s)]
*  What is that like? [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7875.32s)]
*  Feel like? [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7877.2s)]
*  How long does it take you to fall asleep? [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7878.2s)]
*  What does that mean? [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7879.4s)]
*  Yeah, I have a three minute, [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7880.24s)]
*  I hit the, my head hits the pillow [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7882.24s)]
*  and I'm asleep three minutes later. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7883.639999999999s)]
*  Shit. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7885.16s)]
*  So on average, I'm up around 34 minutes a night. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7886.0s)]
*  That's what I call my WASO, my wake after sleep onset. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7889.16s)]
*  It's age based. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7891.64s)]
*  So you can see that number and predict age. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7892.48s)]
*  And then I have about two and a half hours of REM, [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7894.72s)]
*  two and a half hours deep. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7896.4s)]
*  So I get eight hours and 34 minutes of sleep on average. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7897.84s)]
*  And I wanted to show, [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7900.36s)]
*  I wanted to do like an Amelia Earhart [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7901.46s)]
*  or a four minute mile. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7902.92s)]
*  I demonstrated eight months of perfect sleep [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7903.84s)]
*  wearing whoop, this device. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7906.36s)]
*  And so it was 100% sleep score [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7908.32s)]
*  and no one in history has ever done [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7910.12s)]
*  eight months of perfect sleep. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7912.16s)]
*  And I thought, can you achieve high quality sleep? [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7913.52s)]
*  So I did it. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7916.6s)]
*  And I think a lot of people thought it was impossible. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7917.4400000000005s)]
*  The sleep was like this unknown thing. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7919.0s)]
*  When you lay down, it's like, good luck. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7921.2s)]
*  You don't know what's gonna happen. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7923.360000000001s)]
*  So I wanted to show it could be done. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7924.56s)]
*  It doesn't affect you if you're like traveling, [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7925.72s)]
*  like say if you're at a hotel [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7927.4400000000005s)]
*  and you don't have all the same conditions. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7928.6s)]
*  It does. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7930.16s)]
*  So, and that didn't disrupt your perfect sleep [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7931.0s)]
*  or did you stay at home during those months? [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7933.360000000001s)]
*  No, I traveled and I still was successful. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7935.2s)]
*  I would just, so like the power, [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7937.16s)]
*  what I found to be the power laws [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7938.88s)]
*  is eating earlier and less is better. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7940.28s)]
*  If I ate late, then I would have a poor sleep. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7943.92s)]
*  Having a nighttime routine. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7948.2s)]
*  So, 30 to 60 minutes before you go to bed, [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7949.96s)]
*  be able to unwind and separate yourself from the day. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7952.56s)]
*  If your head hits a pillow and you're still upset [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7955.56s)]
*  or you're thinking about solving a problem or whatever, [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7957.52s)]
*  you can ruminate about it all night long. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7959.96s)]
*  Being consistent every single night. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7962.0s)]
*  So set your time, whatever it is, [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7964.16s)]
*  if it's one in the morning, [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7965.76s)]
*  just be consistent every night. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7966.96s)]
*  And that's the same regardless of what time zone you're in. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7968.6s)]
*  So it's 8 p.m. your time zone wherever you are. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7970.4s)]
*  I mean here, I'm from LA, [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7973.0s)]
*  so I'm on New York time for four days. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7974.64s)]
*  All this day in LA time. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7978.04s)]
*  But when I went to Singapore, [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7981.0s)]
*  my son went to Singapore, I acclimated to Singapore time. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7982.36s)]
*  Okay, got it. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7985.6s)]
*  But yeah, there's like a long list of things, not long, [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7987.04s)]
*  10 things I do for my sleep. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7989.6s)]
*  If you nail those and you're reliably consistent, [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7991.28s)]
*  most people can dig themselves out of sleep problems. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7995.06s)]
*  It's just like my hypothesis for you [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=7998.52s)]
*  would be you potentially don't have insomnia. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8002.76s)]
*  You just have habits that are contributing to insomnia. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8006.2s)]
*  Quite possible. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8008.64s)]
*  Now you may have insomnia. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8009.4800000000005s)]
*  I wouldn't argue with you. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8010.4400000000005s)]
*  Possibly, but if people just give a go at the basics, [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8011.320000000001s)]
*  just for a little bit, I promise you, [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8014.6s)]
*  it will surprise you how good life feels. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8017.12s)]
*  So what do you say for someone, [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8021.72s)]
*  he's easy to convince, right? [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8025.360000000001s)]
*  Because he's coming from a deficit. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8026.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8028.360000000001s)]
*  It affects, don't let me speak for you, [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8029.2s)]
*  but it really affects his life. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8031.2s)]
*  It's amazing how he's able to function [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8033.4400000000005s)]
*  at such a high level given he's only getting [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8035.200000000001s)]
*  a few hours of sleep sometimes. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8036.84s)]
*  Someone like me where like, I can sleep pretty well. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8038.400000000001s)]
*  Sometimes I get six hours, sometimes I get nine hours. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8040.76s)]
*  I don't see the benefits of sleep [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8043.160000000001s)]
*  that you were talking about [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8047.68s)]
*  and many other people are talking about. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8049.080000000001s)]
*  What are these benefits? [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8050.360000000001s)]
*  For me, it's a hard motivator [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8052.240000000001s)]
*  because I don't really see it as something [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8054.04s)]
*  that's affecting me that much. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8056.080000000001s)]
*  It might be, I don't even know. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8057.18s)]
*  Maybe I'm not even getting great sleep. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8058.68s)]
*  But do you understand, it's not like a problem [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8061.04s)]
*  that I need solved. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8063.64s)]
*  Whereas some of the other things, [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8065.48s)]
*  if I wanna play this sport for another 20 years, [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8066.76s)]
*  I'm like, well, what do I gotta do? [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8069.04s)]
*  But I talk to him. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8070.04s)]
*  Where's my motivation to do something like that? [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8071.32s)]
*  And even further for him, as a new father, [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8073.0s)]
*  it's like, well, I can't sleep eight hours straight. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8074.48s)]
*  That's just not an option right now. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8076.24s)]
*  Yeah, I would go to the data. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8077.96s)]
*  So when you deal with perception of the mind, [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8079.74s)]
*  it's very, very hard to know if you're looking at reality. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8082.36s)]
*  Right. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8084.96s)]
*  So I start with the data. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8085.8s)]
*  I look at your sleep data, your patterns, [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8087.04s)]
*  and I would look at your respiration rate, your heart rate. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8088.72s)]
*  Get the whoop, look and see how deep I'm sleeping. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8090.76s)]
*  And then if I'm feeling pretty good now, [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8093.4800000000005s)]
*  what you're saying is I could be feeling so much better. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8095.96s)]
*  Yeah, and there's age markers. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8099.320000000001s)]
*  You can look at your sleep data [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8100.84s)]
*  and you can see where you're at in the age graph. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8101.92s)]
*  You may be sleeping like a 55-year-old. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8103.360000000001s)]
*  You may be sleeping like a 30-year-old. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8105.24s)]
*  Just find out. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8106.400000000001s)]
*  Now, if you're sleeping like a 25-year-old, [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8107.24s)]
*  like you just have a good genetic makeup and you're good, [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8108.64s)]
*  great, but just look at the data. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8111.4800000000005s)]
*  Let the data tell you where you're at. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8113.400000000001s)]
*  Because subjective experience is gonna lead you astray. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8114.64s)]
*  And you just whoop over Aura or any of the other. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8118.12s)]
*  They're all great. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8120.84s)]
*  I use it because I like the form factor, but yeah. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8121.68s)]
*  The what? [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8123.48s)]
*  The form factor. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8124.32s)]
*  Form factor, you just like to have the things. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8125.16s)]
*  I like the wrist, yeah. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8125.98s)]
*  But yeah, Aura, Garmin, Fitbit, Apple Watch. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8127.28s)]
*  Just get one of them. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8131.5599999999995s)]
*  They're all gonna give you different data. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8132.88s)]
*  Their algorithms are all different. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8135.04s)]
*  But at least you have some data. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8136.76s)]
*  Which one do you find to be, [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8139.28s)]
*  are you gonna come out with a piece like that? [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8141.76s)]
*  That seems like something that would be. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8143.28s)]
*  No, it's not on our development path. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8144.96s)]
*  There's good graphs out. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8147.2s)]
*  There's good comparisons out there [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8148.52s)]
*  showing the accuracy of the various devices. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8150.2s)]
*  So you can just check one of those. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8152.16s)]
*  They have different accuracies on different things. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8153.26s)]
*  Have you accounted for social interaction in this algorithm? [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8156.240000000001s)]
*  I have, I would say that I. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8161.320000000001s)]
*  Like how important is friendship? [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8164.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8165.92s)]
*  Is that a first principle? [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8168.56s)]
*  Yeah, I have better friends [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8170.54s)]
*  than I've had in my entire life right now. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8174.28s)]
*  And that's probably because I was in a, [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8177.36s)]
*  like I was in a community of people before [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8180.16s)]
*  in a similar religion and or whatever. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8182.44s)]
*  So we had, we were bonded to buy this community thing, [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8183.96s)]
*  but there were some constraints on how far [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8187.639999999999s)]
*  and how deep we'd go with each other. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8190.32s)]
*  And now the people I'm in life with, I'm just in. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8192.48s)]
*  And so for me, I'm like at peak personal relationship time. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8196.88s)]
*  Peak personal relationship. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8202.32s)]
*  I've never had a more fulfilling relationship [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8204.2s)]
*  structure in my life. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8206.640000000001s)]
*  And how important is that to not dying and longevity? [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8207.460000000001s)]
*  Probably pretty important. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8211.800000000001s)]
*  And is there a way to get data on that? [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8213.08s)]
*  Is there a way to calculate that? [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8216.2s)]
*  I mean, we're social human beings. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8217.48s)]
*  We love being around each other. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8219.44s)]
*  We love watching each other laugh, smile, cry. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8220.800000000001s)]
*  Like you see something cool happen on the street, [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8223.08s)]
*  you immediately look for another human being [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8226.16s)]
*  to see if they saw it as well. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8227.800000000001s)]
*  So you can have this beautiful moment [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8228.92s)]
*  where you connect, you do something cool in a sport, [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8230.36s)]
*  you look to make sure someone else saw it. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8232.32s)]
*  Connectivity is crucial. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8234.6s)]
*  And I just wonder if there is some sort of metric [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8236.199999999999s)]
*  where you can see the importance of that. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8238.84s)]
*  Yeah, you could probably tease it out [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8241.88s)]
*  using a whole bunch of different markers. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8243.0s)]
*  I mean, our social bonds are a power law for our longevity. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8244.36s)]
*  Right? [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8247.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8248.32s)]
*  Okay. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8249.14s)]
*  So how do you, that's actually interesting. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8249.98s)]
*  By doing these other things, it's put you in a position [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8252.48s)]
*  to build this community where you've had really strong [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8256.199999999999s)]
*  or peak social relationships. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8259.46s)]
*  Yes. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8261.4s)]
*  So this is. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8263.279999999999s)]
*  Well rested people hanging out, [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8264.119999999999s)]
*  it's the best of each other all the time. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8264.96s)]
*  True. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8266.56s)]
*  So this thing has helped you develop those friends, [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8267.38s)]
*  but what would you say to the person [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8269.279999999999s)]
*  who maybe it's a little bit more difficult [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8270.68s)]
*  for them to develop friendships, [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8271.92s)]
*  knowing how important it is for them to not die, [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8274.119999999999s)]
*  what do you say to them then? [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8277.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8278.16s)]
*  I empathize with them. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8279.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8281.32s)]
*  I'm introverted generally, and it's hard. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8282.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8284.72s)]
*  So yeah, I mean, it's hard being human generally. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8285.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8287.32s)]
*  And especially hard when you're alone. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8288.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8289.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8290.44s)]
*  Yeah, why else are we living? [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8292.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8293.76s)]
*  Yeah, but it's like the difficulty of being human is real. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8294.6s)]
*  And I know we all put on very pretty faces [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8299.04s)]
*  for each other every day, but God, suffering is intense [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8300.960000000001s)]
*  and on all different levels all the time. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8305.04s)]
*  Are you familiar with Dr. Huberman's protocols? [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8309.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8311.76s)]
*  Did you adopt any of the things that his research pointed out [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8312.6s)]
*  or as far as your protocols and his protocols, [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8316.08s)]
*  do you find there's any like misalignments? [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8318.74s)]
*  I mean, I'm generally, I welcome anybody [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8321.78s)]
*  who's working on Don't Die, I celebrate. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8325.66s)]
*  I'm not trying to jockey in the power games of my community, [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8329.66s)]
*  just want us to thrive in this part of the galaxy. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8334.22s)]
*  That's really the objective. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8337.9s)]
*  And so, yeah, it is. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8339.9s)]
*  So I try to overcome, [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8341.66s)]
*  I'm trying to transcend my own proclivities [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8344.34s)]
*  to the games I was taught to be human, [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8347.38s)]
*  of status and power and wealth and jealousy. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8349.38s)]
*  And those are just negative emotions [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8351.82s)]
*  to detract from what I think we can become as a species. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8355.3s)]
*  So I, yeah, I've tried to embody that, [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8357.539999999999s)]
*  just say all, like, let's just all go. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8359.9s)]
*  But like specifically for nighttime, [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8363.099999999999s)]
*  do you not use like light or use your phone [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8364.42s)]
*  or things like that? [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8366.82s)]
*  Or for like daytime, do you try to like line up [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8367.66s)]
*  the way you wake up, like with the sun or things like that? [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8369.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah, like those are some of the more commonly known [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8371.699999999999s)]
*  scientific principles. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8374.38s)]
*  Like, yeah, nighttime, I do avoid screens. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8375.3s)]
*  I wear blue eyed blocking glasses [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8378.82s)]
*  in the morning, I do get light. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8380.099999999999s)]
*  So he's read some of the very similar studies we have. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8380.939999999999s)]
*  So there are some that qualify as good enough evidence [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8384.859999999999s)]
*  that pretty much anyone in the community is doing. [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8388.779999999999s)]
*  That's awesome. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8391.74s)]
*  Yeah, you said you had like 10 things [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8392.58s)]
*  that would help you sleep. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8393.98s)]
*  What are those 10? [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8395.019999999999s)]
*  Or is it too long to? [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8395.859999999999s)]
*  No, I can give you a few. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8397.099999999999s)]
*  I found if I eat late, it chews up my sleep. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8398.9s)]
*  And if I eat the wrong food, it chews up my sleep. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8402.259999999998s)]
*  Yeah, same. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8404.26s)]
*  Yeah, no alcohol, it killed my sleep. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8405.1s)]
*  Wind down the team, if I go to bed and I'm aroused, [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8410.5s)]
*  like if I'm mad or if I'm upset, [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8412.62s)]
*  or if I'm trying to solve a problem or whatever, [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8414.62s)]
*  then it carries over all night, it would ruin sleep. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8417.14s)]
*  How do you not do that? [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8419.66s)]
*  So I had this situation a couple of years ago, [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8423.06s)]
*  I used to overeat every single night. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8425.78s)]
*  I came in my dark days of depression [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8427.460000000001s)]
*  and at 7 p.m. would arrive and I'd call this guy. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8429.300000000001s)]
*  So I would overeat because I'd put the kids to bed, [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8432.78s)]
*  I was exhausted and just wanted to die. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8436.619999999999s)]
*  I knew my partner was on the couch, [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8439.22s)]
*  like waiting for a fight and I was like, [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8440.5s)]
*  oh my God, I just wanna be like the opossum. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8441.46s)]
*  I wanna be like the opossum, [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8444.02s)]
*  lay down and pretend like I'm dead. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8445.82s)]
*  And the only thought that would give me, [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8447.66s)]
*  soothe my grief was the idea of food in the kitchen. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8450.699999999999s)]
*  And like if I could just eat myself into oblivion. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8454.82s)]
*  And so I was 60 pounds heavier than I am now [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8458.14s)]
*  and I couldn't stop myself from that behavior. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8460.74s)]
*  Every day I'd wake up and be like, last day, [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8463.539999999999s)]
*  I'm exercising and I'm gonna eat well all day [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8466.699999999999s)]
*  and then 7 p.m. would come and like just disaster. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8468.98s)]
*  I get that. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8471.18s)]
*  So then like one day out of desperation, [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8472.22s)]
*  I couldn't buckle my pants because it was too tight. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8474.619999999999s)]
*  You know, it's just like, it felt so uncomfortable. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8476.9s)]
*  And I said, evening, Brian, you're fired. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8478.86s)]
*  Like you make my life miserable, you're done. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8482.14s)]
*  And so it was the first time in my life [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8484.619999999999s)]
*  where I separated myself from my behavior. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8486.18s)]
*  It was this joke, I was like, [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8491.1s)]
*  that's kind of a silly concept. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8492.14s)]
*  And then I listed out like who is evening Brian? [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8493.34s)]
*  What are his characteristics? [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8496.06s)]
*  What arguments does he use? [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8497.5s)]
*  Like today's the last day, [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8498.58s)]
*  tomorrow we don't work out really hard. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8500.14s)]
*  He's very clever. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8501.94s)]
*  And I just made a rule from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8503.38s)]
*  evening Brian cannot eat. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8506.38s)]
*  Like he under no circumstance can he eat. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8508.22s)]
*  And that's all before me. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8511.78s)]
*  And so then at nighttime, I say, sleep Brian is in charge. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8513.22s)]
*  So when sleep Brian 30 minutes before bedtime, [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8517.06s)]
*  he's in charge. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8519.7s)]
*  So any incoming thought of like, [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8520.7s)]
*  this problem is major and it's gonna cause [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8522.54s)]
*  all kinds of crisis or like, [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8526.1s)]
*  you feel really bad about this interaction. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8527.820000000002s)]
*  So you wish you wouldn't have said that. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8529.300000000001s)]
*  The sleep Brian says, thank you for that observation. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8530.980000000001s)]
*  We are now in sleep mode. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8534.02s)]
*  So we can think about that tomorrow. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8535.5s)]
*  We have all day to think about that problem. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8536.94s)]
*  Right now we're gonna focus on priority sleep. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8538.86s)]
*  So it's a way for me, [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8541.380000000001s)]
*  the trick I learned when I was depressed, [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8542.220000000001s)]
*  when my mind said, you should commit suicide. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8544.1s)]
*  I learned that that was not me. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8547.060000000001s)]
*  It was my mind suggesting things when I said, [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8549.34s)]
*  thank you mind for that suggestion. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8552.02s)]
*  I'm now not going to listen to you. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8553.5s)]
*  So it's a way for you to take a meditative practice [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8555.380000000001s)]
*  to filter out life. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8557.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8558.98s)]
*  Otherwise you're unknowingly ruled by your mind. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8559.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8563.78s)]
*  Which is just chaotic and it's spewing all day long, [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8564.62s)]
*  all the reasons why you should hate yourself [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8568.14s)]
*  and kill yourself and not love yourself. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8569.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8571.42s)]
*  It's really quite difficult. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8572.26s)]
*  I've heard people do this with like anxiety a lot, [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8573.1s)]
*  like labeling their anxiety or even giving it a name. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8574.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8577.02s)]
*  And then when they hear the anxious thought like, [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8577.86s)]
*  oh, you're not good enough, [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8578.9s)]
*  you're gonna fail in the future, [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8580.02s)]
*  they're able to identify it as like, [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8581.38s)]
*  okay, that's insert name. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8582.5s)]
*  Like that's not me, that's a different thing in my brain [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8584.619999999999s)]
*  that's trying to detract. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8587.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8588.26s)]
*  That's a really smart approach to, [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8589.1s)]
*  even just optimizing little things in your life, [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8590.66s)]
*  like sleep and stuff. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8592.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8593.18s)]
*  Yeah, that's cool. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8594.02s)]
*  You stopped eating at 11 a.m. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8594.94s)]
*  Wakes up at 430, right? [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8597.699999999999s)]
*  So from 11 to 830, [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8600.1s)]
*  at what point does the hunger start to set in? [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8605.539999999999s)]
*  Because you have to get hungry, right? [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8608.9s)]
*  You don't just get used to not eating. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8610.14s)]
*  I'm kinda used to it. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8611.58s)]
*  Really? [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8613.42s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8614.26s)]
*  It burned me up for a while and now I'm pretty used to it. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8615.18s)]
*  Used to it meaning the sensation of hunger has become normal [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8617.98s)]
*  and now it's your kind of like baseline. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8621.42s)]
*  I'm more satiated and less hungry now. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8623.34s)]
*  Before I was like excruciatingly hungry [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8625.82s)]
*  and now I'm pretty satiated. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8628.699999999999s)]
*  Okay, and this is part of, I think the same question. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8630.98s)]
*  Are you concerned about working out too much [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8634.06s)]
*  because it would increase your caloric intake? [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8638.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8643.18s)]
*  Which would offset these other markers? [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8644.02s)]
*  We've been, so we've had the same question. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8645.7s)]
*  I'm caloric restricted and I exercise an hour a day [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8647.58s)]
*  and I'm vegan and so you put those, [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8651.98s)]
*  and I'm on low protein. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8654.380000000001s)]
*  So I'm 110 grams of protein a day. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8655.5s)]
*  Those are all no-nos. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8657.94s)]
*  Yeah, that. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8659.74s)]
*  Yet, according to MRI, my body fat and muscle [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8661.58s)]
*  are the top 99.5 percentile. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8666.300000000001s)]
*  My cardiovascular ability is the top 1.5% of 18-year-olds. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8669.26s)]
*  My speed of aging is among the lowest in the world. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8673.1s)]
*  So according to all the data we can get, [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8675.78s)]
*  my bone mineral density is the top 99.8 percentile [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8677.82s)]
*  of 30-year-olds, which is age min for the test. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8680.82s)]
*  So by all the data we can see, it seems to be okay. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8683.82s)]
*  And if there's problems, we haven't yet found it. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8687.34s)]
*  Again, we're always open to being wrong, [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8689.1s)]
*  but right now the data looks pristine [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8691.62s)]
*  on every measure we're looking at. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8693.94s)]
*  Are there any variables that you are accounting for [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8696.58s)]
*  pharmacologically? [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8699.9s)]
*  For example, blood pressure, or you want to statin, [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8701.62s)]
*  like are there any traditional methods that you take, [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8705.66s)]
*  maybe you don't have blood, [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8708.42s)]
*  what is it, blood pressure problems, [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8710.26s)]
*  you're just taking them as a preventative measure. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8711.94s)]
*  What are they? [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8714.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'm on, so we love drugs. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8715.14s)]
*  Okay, this is good. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8717.460000000001s)]
*  You're a calc of drugs, you're on for everything. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8718.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so I hurt my, I went hiking and I hurt my shin [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8720.58s)]
*  and I had to go to an emergency room [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8725.9s)]
*  and get it stitched up. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8727.58s)]
*  So I went in there and the doctor came down. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8728.86s)]
*  He's like, all right, son, we'll get you stitched up. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8730.78s)]
*  Before I do so, are you on any meds? [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8732.9s)]
*  I was like, oh no. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8735.1s)]
*  So I was like, all right, what the hell, I'll try. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8738.02s)]
*  I'll give it a go. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8739.06s)]
*  I said, well, yeah, I'm on metformin. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8739.9s)]
*  He said, the drug they give to diabetics, yes. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8741.3s)]
*  I'm on rapamycin, the drug they give to people [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8744.74s)]
*  who are doing organ transplantation, yes. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8747.5s)]
*  I'm on the statinib, the leukemia drug, yes. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8749.98s)]
*  He's like, good Lord, son, what's going on? [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8752.94s)]
*  But it was such a sobering moment for me to realize [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8755.94s)]
*  how far we had gone in and how disconnected we were [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8759.86s)]
*  from standard of care. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8762.62s)]
*  So yeah, so for blood, so yeah, I'm on metformin. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8764.5s)]
*  I do 1,500 milligrams a day. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8767.78s)]
*  I do a carbose, 400 milligrams a day. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8770.980000000001s)]
*  What's a carbose? [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8773.380000000001s)]
*  It's like a blood sugar modulator. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8774.220000000001s)]
*  Same as metformin. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8778.1s)]
*  Yeah, I do metformin. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8778.94s)]
*  Now we do metformin for polyps prevention, [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8779.9s)]
*  but a lot of people don't take metformin [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8783.34s)]
*  because they're worried about reduction of exercise gains [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8784.98s)]
*  that kind of gained some popularity. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8787.58s)]
*  If it did, all my exercise and fitness markers [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8789.9s)]
*  are at the top decile of performance, [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8792.26s)]
*  so fine if there's a cost for paying that. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8793.699999999999s)]
*  Then I do rapamycin. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8796.38s)]
*  Maybe you've heard, we do a pretty aggressive protocol [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8799.22s)]
*  on that, and like for example, the antirapamycin, [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8801.699999999999s)]
*  it's a drug discovered just recently, [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8804.699999999999s)]
*  and it's really promising in terms of how it extends [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8806.98s)]
*  the metformin-rapamycin combo was the 10th most powerful [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8810.74s)]
*  longevity study, extending lifespan by 20%. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8813.34s)]
*  Yeah, there's a, what is it, a Tia, [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8816.38s)]
*  is that how you pronounce it's name? [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8819.3s)]
*  I think he's a big- Peter Atea. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8820.42s)]
*  Yeah, Peter Atea has been talking a lot about rapamycin. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8821.98s)]
*  Yeah, rapamycin, yeah. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8824.3s)]
*  Okay, yeah, yeah. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8825.5s)]
*  Yeah, so rap is a big one. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8826.34s)]
*  So on that one, it's a drug that, [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8827.58s)]
*  so we've been measuring the half-life. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8830.42s)]
*  So once you take it, you have a C-max where like, [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8832.1s)]
*  it peaks in the blood and then it slowly decays [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8835.66s)]
*  through it's half-life. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8837.94s)]
*  So we take the dose and we measure my blood [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8839.14s)]
*  two hours after 24, 48, 72, and 96, [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8841.58s)]
*  and we watch through the decay curve. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8844.779999999999s)]
*  So we do it all these drugs, we try to measure it [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8846.9s)]
*  as extensively as possible to figure out [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8849.619999999999s)]
*  what dose to take and why. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8851.539999999999s)]
*  And so I'm currently on a dose where I do 13 milligrams [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8853.14s)]
*  of rapamycin on week zero, nine week one, [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8855.38s)]
*  13 week two, et cetera, so, [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8859.9s)]
*  relative between 13 and nine milligrams per week. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8861.699999999999s)]
*  Not asking you to be a smitch on your doctor dealer, [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8864.98s)]
*  but how are you getting all these prescription drugs [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8868.22s)]
*  without having the medical necessities [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8870.42s)]
*  for these prescription drugs? [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8872.539999999999s)]
*  So they can be Rx'd by any doctor, [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8874.46s)]
*  it's just a question, will the doctor do it? [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8876.74s)]
*  He's willing to take that risk. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8878.98s)]
*  Yeah, exactly, because the doctor will, [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8880.42s)]
*  they may not be familiar with it, [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8882.099999999999s)]
*  they may feel like it's going to endanger their license. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8883.46s)]
*  So it's not a commonplace thing, [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8886.16s)]
*  and you have to dig into the literature [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8887.9s)]
*  to see it's actually. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8889.3s)]
*  One, sorry, one prescription drug [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8890.38s)]
*  everybody should try to take for longevity, [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8892.099999999999s)]
*  quality of life, anything you think. [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8894.859999999999s)]
*  Or two. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8899.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8901.099999999999s)]
*  It feels like you need to take a few [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8901.939999999999s)]
*  to offset the side effects, right? [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8903.06s)]
*  It's so hard, I guess I've learned enough about this [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8906.619999999999s)]
*  to say it depends. [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8910.019999999999s)]
*  Your age, your circumstances, your health profile, [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8912.099999999999s)]
*  it's nuanced. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8916.019999999999s)]
*  Okay, fair. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8917.539999999999s)]
*  So there's not just one catchall for everybody. [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8919.42s)]
*  It's really the power laws, [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8922.699999999999s)]
*  as much as they're not sexy, sleep diet exercise, [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8923.98s)]
*  that's not what people want to hear, [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8928.26s)]
*  stopping bad stuff. [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8930.019999999999s)]
*  Sometimes stopping the bad stuff, [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8931.34s)]
*  people want to do good things [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8933.699999999999s)]
*  because it's an easy thing to do. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8935.06s)]
*  If you buy a bottle of pills, you pop it. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8936.9s)]
*  When you have to stop eating [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8941.179999999998s)]
*  a pint of ice cream every night, that's hard. [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8942.58s)]
*  So most, yeah. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8946.38s)]
*  How do you feel about Ozembic [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8948.5s)]
*  that's helping people stop the cravings for the bad stuff? [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8949.98s)]
*  But yeah. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8953.179999999998s)]
*  So this is the question, [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8954.26s)]
*  if you had access to an algorithm, [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8955.699999999999s)]
*  that could, Ozembic is an algorithm. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8958.9s)]
*  It turns off your hunger. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8962.5s)]
*  And so this is the question, [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8965.3s)]
*  when we humans hear this question, we're like, fuck no. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8966.38s)]
*  When it helps us do something we want, [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8969.42s)]
*  we're like, fuck yeah. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8970.74s)]
*  And it happens so fast, we don't even think about it. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8972.619999999999s)]
*  So Ozembic is a good example of you assemble [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8975.3s)]
*  a few molecules, you swallow it, magic happens. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8978.14s)]
*  And we're gonna have, [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8982.26s)]
*  because AI is now the primary drug designer, [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8983.3s)]
*  we're gonna have fantastic drugs. [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8986.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8988.02s)]
*  You did say there was something [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8989.22s)]
*  that was even more effective than Ozembic [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8991.14s)]
*  that's natural though, which is EVOO, right? [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8992.78s)]
*  Can you explain that a little bit? [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8995.78s)]
*  Yeah, I was doing that a little bit tongue in cheek. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8996.9s)]
*  Extra virgin olive oil. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=8999.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9000.82s)]
*  Yeah, we call it snake oil. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9002.38s)]
*  But you're pushing this stuff. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9005.98s)]
*  You said that was the one thing [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9008.02s)]
*  that you would recommend to anybody. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9009.7s)]
*  Yeah, so we went through my daily calories, [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9012.22s)]
*  I have 2,250 calories every day. [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9014.86s)]
*  And we had a rule where we said every calorie [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9018.34s)]
*  has to fight for its life. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9019.94s)]
*  If it doesn't do something in the body, it's out. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9022.14s)]
*  There's nothing that's cool or trendy, [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9024.18s)]
*  or it can't be on taste, [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9025.66s)]
*  it has to give the body the ideal outcome. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9027.38s)]
*  And so yeah, extra virgin olive oil [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9030.7s)]
*  is 15% of my daily calories. [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9032.42s)]
*  It has a bigger spot out of any caloric intake [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9034.5s)]
*  I have of any food. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9037.58s)]
*  Wow. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9038.42s)]
*  And so we had a problem, [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9039.26s)]
*  but it has to be of a very specific type. [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9040.62s)]
*  It has to be six criteria. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9042.46s)]
*  Most extra virgin olive oil in the world [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9044.22s)]
*  does not hit it. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9047.54s)]
*  It's lower quality or has other oils. [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9048.380000000001s)]
*  And so we had this big problem [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9051.26s)]
*  of trying to solve high quality oil. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9052.58s)]
*  And so we started sourcing it for ourselves. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9054.42s)]
*  Then friends and family were like, I want some too. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9056.7s)]
*  We're like, okay. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9058.66s)]
*  So yeah, we did a brand. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9059.98s)]
*  And so I basically sell it at cost. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9061.86s)]
*  That was my question. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9064.380000000001s)]
*  This is not a money-making thing. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9065.54s)]
*  Like my hit is so low, [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9066.62s)]
*  we're basically getting out at no cost. [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9069.34s)]
*  Is that your intention with Mo? [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9071.060000000001s)]
*  Cause you have, I was checking your website, [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9072.34s)]
*  you have products coming. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9073.66s)]
*  You have protein bars, you got. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9074.66s)]
*  Is it all gonna be around cost for us? [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9076.98s)]
*  We're very close. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9081.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9082.02s)]
*  Our margins, I've tried to be as low margin. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9082.859999999999s)]
*  Evo is like basically no profit. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9087.18s)]
*  The other prices will be, [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9089.26s)]
*  other margins will be a bit higher, [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9090.3s)]
*  but just enough to let us operate as a company. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9092.1s)]
*  This is genuinely trying to, [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9095.02s)]
*  we're trying to, the objective is don't die, [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9097.3s)]
*  not to make a bunch of money. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9100.02s)]
*  In the mode of delivery for olive oil, [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9101.98s)]
*  do you just drink it [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9103.539999999999s)]
*  or do you use it as an actual dressing? [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9104.42s)]
*  Either. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9106.7s)]
*  Really? [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9107.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9108.38s)]
*  I do three tablespoons a day. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9109.3s)]
*  I do one with each meal. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9110.5s)]
*  Like interesting data on extra virgin olive oils, [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9111.62s)]
*  when you eat, it causes your body damage. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9113.66s)]
*  So it's just an unavoidable thing. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9116.1s)]
*  Eat food causes aging damage. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9117.66s)]
*  And so Evo will lower blood sugar response. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9120.1s)]
*  It lowers oxidized LDL. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9123.3s)]
*  It lowers LDL. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9124.94s)]
*  So it lessens damage that happens in the body. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9126.78s)]
*  And then it's shown to be positive for mood and for weight [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9129.86s)]
*  and for blood pressure and for arterial. [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9132.46s)]
*  Like what happens when you have oxidized LDL [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9135.339999999998s)]
*  is it builds up arterial plaques. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9137.38s)]
*  And plaque in arteries is very bad. [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9139.179999999998s)]
*  And so it eliminates the oxidized LDL. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9141.74s)]
*  And so it has so many positive benefits over whole body. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9143.779999999999s)]
*  So I jokingly said, like tongue and cheek, [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9146.98s)]
*  extra virgin olive oil is more powerful than NR, [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9149.859999999999s)]
*  cold plunge, sauna, [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9153.099999999999s)]
*  ozembic and your favorite podcast. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9155.939999999999s)]
*  And I was like, I was kind of fucking around. [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9157.66s)]
*  But kind of not. [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9160.14s)]
*  But kind of not. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9161.179999999998s)]
*  We talk about all this stuff, [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9162.9s)]
*  but if you follow the evidence, [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9164.26s)]
*  it's a pretty solid food [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9166.66s)]
*  that everyone should just have on a diet as a staple. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9168.82s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9170.78s)]
*  Okay, AI is gonna be, [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9171.62s)]
*  you said AI is already designing all of our drugs. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9174.220000000001s)]
*  Or design drugs, right? [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9177.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9180.18s)]
*  Where does that go? [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9181.300000000001s)]
*  What drugs are we gonna get [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9182.62s)]
*  in the very near future from AI? [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9184.220000000001s)]
*  So now we have the ability to engineer atoms [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9186.18s)]
*  and molecules and biological systems. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9192.78s)]
*  Okay. [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9195.86s)]
*  We have the ability to engineer digital reality. [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9197.26s)]
*  We've just entered the ability to engineer all of reality. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9200.140000000001s)]
*  Now we can't, this is the thing. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9205.94s)]
*  That's the moment we're at. [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9208.78s)]
*  So we can put things on our eyes. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9211.42s)]
*  Just explain that one more time. [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9213.060000000001s)]
*  So we have digital reality, we got that. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9214.460000000001s)]
*  But now if you can engineer atoms and molecules, [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9215.98s)]
*  you can make whatever you want? [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9219.86s)]
*  This is the thing, we have, [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9223.54s)]
*  That's insane. [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9225.34s)]
*  It's like an absolute explosion. [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9226.18s)]
*  Explain that to it, [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9229.82s)]
*  because you know where this could go [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9231.18s)]
*  because you're, I don't know if it's a futurist [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9233.34s)]
*  or you've already subscribed, [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9236.42s)]
*  you know the power of AI. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9237.900000000001s)]
*  Again, there are so many people right now [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9240.02s)]
*  that are still just skeptical. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9241.34s)]
*  They don't get it yet. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9242.82s)]
*  It's almost like Facebook first coming out. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9243.82s)]
*  They're like, what is this for? [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9245.42s)]
*  So just break it down for us. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9247.18s)]
*  When you say we can engineer atoms and molecules, [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9248.78s)]
*  where does your brain go with that? [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9251.900000000001s)]
*  What are we making exactly? [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9253.58s)]
*  Okay, so here's an example. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9255.300000000001s)]
*  If you were to ask somebody a thousand years ago, [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9257.220000000001s)]
*  how big is reality? [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9259.94s)]
*  They would say, well, they kind of see, they feel, they touch. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9262.820000000002s)]
*  You use your senses in a certain way. [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9267.02s)]
*  And then we discovered there's this thing [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9269.220000000001s)]
*  called the electromagnetic spectrum. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9270.74s)]
*  It's like a trillion times bigger [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9272.820000000002s)]
*  than what we can see with our eyes. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9274.900000000001s)]
*  And we've just discovered more and more of reality. [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9276.46s)]
*  And so reality is like, [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9279.619999999999s)]
*  or just a magnitude bigger than we ever thought possible. [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9281.859999999999s)]
*  So now you take this basic question, [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9284.539999999999s)]
*  what are the possible conscious states we could have? [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9286.46s)]
*  So we were born and we say, well, [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9291.06s)]
*  we know what happiness feels like and sadness. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9292.699999999999s)]
*  I know what it feels like to get hurt and skin my knee. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9294.699999999999s)]
*  I know what it feels like to fall in love. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9296.9s)]
*  I know what it feels like to get drunk. [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9298.419999999998s)]
*  So we, and then you could do a psychedelic, [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9300.099999999999s)]
*  you're like, that's a different experience. [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9301.339999999998s)]
*  So we start to sample like, [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9303.5s)]
*  what is roughly the size of consciousness? [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9305.1s)]
*  And we have in our minds like this rough idea. [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9307.1s)]
*  Now you apply AI and you apply the ability [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9309.619999999999s)]
*  to engineer atoms, molecules, and organisms. [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9312.26s)]
*  How big is consciousness? [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9314.74s)]
*  Is it a trillion times bigger than what we realize? [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9316.779999999999s)]
*  Like as other things have followed in the past [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9319.58s)]
*  where we have caught this very narrow glimpse. [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9321.779999999999s)]
*  And so this is why it's so exciting of Don't Die [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9324.699999999999s)]
*  is we have a hard time letting go of things in the past. [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9327.18s)]
*  Like we love our games of wealth and status and power. [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9330.74s)]
*  Like they're familiar, we're winning at them, [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9333.66s)]
*  like whatever, but to jump, it's like being on monkey bars. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9335.58s)]
*  You wanna let go of one bar to swing to the next to grab it. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9339.3s)]
*  But if you can't see it, you don't wanna swing. [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9342.34s)]
*  We can't see it, so we don't know if we wanna swing. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9344.46s)]
*  But if we have, I've been investing in this for 15 years now, [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9346.86s)]
*  when you can take an atom and build them like Legos, [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9351.06s)]
*  when you can design a biological system to do a given thing, [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9354.18s)]
*  when you can design digital reality [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9357.74s)]
*  and you can do the full stack. [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9359.619999999999s)]
*  What do we get? [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9362.1s)]
*  Just tell me what I'm looking at. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9362.94s)]
*  Okay, it could be a situation where not only do you not age, [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9364.300000000001s)]
*  but you acquire superhuman abilities. [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9375.66s)]
*  So like dunking would be whatever. [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9379.42s)]
*  How would I acquire that? [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9381.62s)]
*  Let's just say. [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9384.02s)]
*  What are you doing with those atoms and molecules? [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9384.86s)]
*  Are you shooting them in me and making me a black? [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9386.26s)]
*  I'm a rookie. [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9390.1s)]
*  I still can't do it. [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9390.94s)]
*  I gotta do different things. [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9398.52s)]
*  But for real, what? [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9399.36s)]
*  So let's just say what you have to deal with [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9400.2s)]
*  is your joint strength, your muscles. [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9403.42s)]
*  We have to just deal with your physiology, right? [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9407.68s)]
*  So let's just say we've got a few gene therapies [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9409.42s)]
*  that we would utilize. [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9412.619999999999s)]
*  Yeah, just like a few therapies. [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9416.94s)]
*  And now you've got the joints and the muscles to dunk. [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9418.26s)]
*  And not just dunk on a 10-foot rim, but you know like. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9423.939999999999s)]
*  20-foot rim if I want. [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9425.98s)]
*  Whatever, like. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9426.939999999999s)]
*  You're augmenting my body [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9429.58s)]
*  based on these molecular structures [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9431.34s)]
*  that you're building outside of me [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9432.82s)]
*  to give me whatever power, super power that I want. [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9434.74s)]
*  Fuck, there's a zero right there. [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9439.26s)]
*  Sports done. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9440.98s)]
*  So here's an example, if you can pull this up. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9442.26s)]
*  Have you seen the full-statin dog? [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9444.58s)]
*  Okay. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9447.439999999999s)]
*  What was it? [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9448.279999999999s)]
*  Type in full-statin dog or full-statin cow. [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9449.119999999999s)]
*  How do you spell it? [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9451.24s)]
*  F-O-L-L. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9452.08s)]
*  You did full-statin, right? [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9452.92s)]
*  I did, I just did my first gene therapy. [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9453.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9457.48s)]
*  We need to talk about. [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9458.32s)]
*  How did that go? [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9459.16s)]
*  Okay, do you want to tell us before [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9459.98s)]
*  that you tell us about this dog or do you? [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9461.52s)]
*  Let's take a picture. [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9462.64s)]
*  Pull up the cow, go down, second one in from the left. [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9463.48s)]
*  So that cow has similar effects [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9467.439999999999s)]
*  to the gene therapy I just did. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9471.16s)]
*  That's real? [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9473.039999999999s)]
*  Yep, and you can do a full-statin dog, [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9473.88s)]
*  you'll see one too. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9475.76s)]
*  I mean, that doesn't look particularly healthy, right? [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9477.36s)]
*  It looks like the most healthy cow [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9480.2s)]
*  I've ever seen in my life. [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9482.48s)]
*  And that cow's not working out, right? [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9483.52s)]
*  It's not like it's on somebody. [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9484.64s)]
*  It's just walking around. [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9485.48s)]
*  Oh, that's muscle? [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9486.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9488.84s)]
*  Yeah, exactly, it's muscle. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9490.0s)]
*  Yeah, go type in full-statin dog. [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9491.0s)]
*  Oh, no way. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9493.08s)]
*  This thing's about to look sick. [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9494.48s)]
*  So, yeah. [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9495.92s)]
*  I just did this gene therapy. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9499.28s)]
*  What in the fuck? [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9500.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9502.04s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9504.0s)]
*  It's just a hood pit bull. [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9505.88s)]
*  Okay, so this therapy ranks number seven [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9507.039999999999s)]
*  as all-time best performing lifespan study. [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9512.24s)]
*  It's over 30% in mice. [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9514.76s)]
*  And so I got the injection in September. [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9516.8s)]
*  I got two injections in my abdomen. [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9518.6s)]
*  This is an adipose tissue. [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9520.64s)]
*  And it inhibits myostatin, [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9522.84s)]
*  but I didn't do it to do that, [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9525.119999999999s)]
*  even though it has effects on muscle growth. [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9526.6s)]
*  I did it because it has potential effects [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9529.0s)]
*  in slowing speed of aging, reducing epigenetic age, [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9531.0s)]
*  all whole body benefits. [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9535.32s)]
*  So I'm doing my first set of measurements next month, [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9536.359999999999s)]
*  whole body, increase of telomeres, a whole bunch of stuff. [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9540.24s)]
*  But we studied gene therapy for three years, [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9543.6s)]
*  and we didn't do it because we couldn't find [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9547.16s)]
*  any safe gene therapies. [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9550.0s)]
*  Because once you do a gene therapy, [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9551.279999999999s)]
*  it starts doing this thing in your body. [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9553.16s)]
*  If you don't like it, you can't stop it. [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9554.64s)]
*  And when that happens, that's cancer. [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9556.88s)]
*  And so this therapy is a plasma-immediated gene therapy. [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9559.4s)]
*  So you have a kill switch. [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9563.04s)]
*  So if you don't like it, you take tetracycline, [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9565.04s)]
*  it kills it, it's done. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9567.24s)]
*  And so it's safer. [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9569.08s)]
*  This is the issue with the peptides, right? [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9570.56s)]
*  This, if you're increasing cell growth [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9572.32s)]
*  and those cells are in some way negative [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9573.76s)]
*  or they're cancerous, [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9575.52s)]
*  you're kind of fucking yourself over. [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9576.36s)]
*  Always a give and take on how you do it. [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9577.84s)]
*  So full of statin, there is a kill switch. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9579.28s)]
*  With this therapy. [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9581.88s)]
*  So it's delivered via a plasmid, [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9582.88s)]
*  and the protein just sets up shop the nucleus. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9585.36s)]
*  And so it has increased muscle. [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9588.2s)]
*  So the delivery system is the kill switch, [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9591.48s)]
*  not the actual protein that you're delivering to the body. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9594.4s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9598.4s)]
*  The kill switch will kill the protein [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9599.24s)]
*  expressing itself inside the nucleus, [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9600.64s)]
*  and the plasma just gets it there. [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9602.4s)]
*  But the cool thing is, you can do sleep, diet exercise, [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9604.88s)]
*  you can get a few extra years of life, great, cool. [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9608.56s)]
*  But what you're talking about is like, [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9610.939999999999s)]
*  tell me why to be pumped about this. [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9612.16s)]
*  It's coming. [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9614.439999999999s)]
*  And so now we're getting these vectors, yes. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9615.56s)]
*  Like, can I get a gene? [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9618.52s)]
*  Fuck you, genetics. [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9619.68s)]
*  Can I get a gene therapy for sleep? [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9620.64s)]
*  You're like, the whole thing opens up. [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9622.32s)]
*  I mean, theoretically, even if your diet sounds boring, [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9625.0s)]
*  or you could just rearrange this super healthy food [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9627.92s)]
*  to taste like a chocolate brownie or whatever the fuck. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9631.92s)]
*  This is the thing, like this is it, guys. [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9634.08s)]
*  Like this, wow, we don't wanna die. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9635.359999999999s)]
*  Oh, wait a minute, you're saying, holy shit. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9636.96s)]
*  You could use gene therapy to make everything that you eat [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9639.8s)]
*  taste like the best thing you've ever had? [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9646.279999999999s)]
*  Well, maybe not gene therapy, but AI could do it. [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9648.72s)]
*  I mean, if it can rearrange molecules, right? [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9651.16s)]
*  I mean, Ozembic. [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9652.0s)]
*  Reality is its own thing. [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9652.84s)]
*  It plays with reality however we want it [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9655.279999999999s)]
*  to play with reality ideally. [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9657.359999999999s)]
*  Ozembic changes your brain so you don't have hunger. [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9658.84s)]
*  It just turns it off. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9661.76s)]
*  Aren't there side effects to Ozembic? [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9663.119999999999s)]
*  Like your fucking stomach ache or something? [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9664.68s)]
*  So I am not advocating for Ozembic. [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9667.039999999999s)]
*  I'm just making the observation that it's happening. [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9669.84s)]
*  Now, like there's some serious potential side effects. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9673.279999999999s)]
*  Like it may be a disastrous idea, like we don't know yet. [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9675.119999999999s)]
*  I am not doing Ozembic. [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9677.88s)]
*  I wouldn't do it personally. [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9679.12s)]
*  But then again, I'm not 350 pounds and like really struggling. [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9680.52s)]
*  So like I'm sympathetic to where people are at [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9683.52s)]
*  and I'm not criticizing or judging. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9685.800000000001s)]
*  It's just like it's there, it's happening. [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9687.68s)]
*  But yeah, like this is why this is so exciting that- [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9690.480000000001s)]
*  And we're like, how many years off from this? [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9694.0s)]
*  We're here, I just did it. [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9695.68s)]
*  I just did my gene therapy and I took my dad. [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9696.52s)]
*  I did my, I took my dad there to do it. [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9698.44s)]
*  It's in Honduras off the island [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9699.960000000001s)]
*  in this special economic zone, Prospera. [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9702.04s)]
*  And so my dad is set- [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9704.44s)]
*  It's called Prospera. [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9705.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9707.119999999999s)]
*  My dad is 71. [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9708.359999999999s)]
*  His calculated life expectancy is 68. [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9710.0s)]
*  So these models of lifespan are very good. [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9713.72s)]
*  He included his time of obesity in life, [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9716.279999999999s)]
*  his hard drug usage, it calculates 68. [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9719.0s)]
*  So he's passed too. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9721.72s)]
*  There's a lot of people in that situation in life. [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9723.599999999999s)]
*  And so I've been on project, don't let dad die. [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9725.48s)]
*  So I gave him a leader of my plasma. [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9728.64s)]
*  I took him through the gene therapy [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9730.24s)]
*  and I'm taking him next month [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9732.0s)]
*  to do mesenchymal stem cells in the Bahamas. [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9732.88s)]
*  So like, I think it's a really cool thing of like, [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9735.0s)]
*  what can we do in society to not die? [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9737.64s)]
*  Everyone. [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9740.039999999999s)]
*  It's not like, my dad is fighting for life. [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9740.88s)]
*  He's raging against death. [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9742.8s)]
*  I think it's amazing. [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9745.16s)]
*  It seems like a lot of project don't die [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9746.0s)]
*  is actually project don't let dad die [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9747.8s)]
*  from what I've heard about, [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9749.88s)]
*  from what I've heard of you in other interviews. [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9750.96s)]
*  Probably. [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9752.439999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9753.439999999999s)]
*  Which is noble. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9754.279999999999s)]
*  I'm not judging that at all. [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9755.099999999999s)]
*  If there was a don't let mom die [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9756.939999999999s)]
*  and I had a much smarter brain, I would be all over it. [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9758.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9761.08s)]
*  So this is wild. [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9761.92s)]
*  The stem cells, what is he doing them for? [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9765.76s)]
*  Yeah, so in the Bahamas, [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9768.0s)]
*  there's a company called Cellco Labs. [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9770.0s)]
*  They do young Swedish bone marrow. [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9772.0s)]
*  This is why people think I'm just so like crazy, right? [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9776.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9778.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9779.56s)]
*  The Swedish part is the weirdest part. [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9780.4s)]
*  Just touching myself here. [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9781.800000000001s)]
*  Why Swedish? [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9783.36s)]
*  Why Swedish? [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9784.2s)]
*  What is the city? [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9785.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9785.880000000001s)]
*  You just said bone marrow. [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9786.72s)]
*  We'd be totally fine. [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9787.84s)]
*  You got real specific. [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9788.960000000001s)]
*  I say it because it's a company in Sweden. [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9789.800000000001s)]
*  They're very good. [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9792.44s)]
*  They're good at science. [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9793.28s)]
*  They are structured, they're methodical. [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9794.76s)]
*  They do things at clinical grade. [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9796.720000000001s)]
*  So we looked at doing stem cells for a long time, [[02:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9798.24s)]
*  but you don't wanna mess with stem cells. [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9800.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9801.36s)]
*  So they met our criteria for safety. [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9802.2s)]
*  And so I did an infusion of a hundred million of those [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9804.08s)]
*  in November. [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9807.36s)]
*  Where'd you get them infused? [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9810.08s)]
*  The Bahamas. [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9811.640000000001s)]
*  No, no, no, in your body. [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9812.48s)]
*  Oh, just the vein. [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9813.44s)]
*  Oh, I thought stem cells go to like a certain part, [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9814.84s)]
*  a problem area. [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9817.28s)]
*  Okay. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9818.56s)]
*  So yeah, in March, so I guess in a month from now, [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9819.4s)]
*  I'm doing the world's first whole body joint rejuvenation [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9821.12s)]
*  with messing cum with stem cells. [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9825.36s)]
*  I just completed MRIs of every joint in my body. [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9826.44s)]
*  And I'm going to get messing cum with stem cells [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9829.800000000001s)]
*  injected in every single joint [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9831.28s)]
*  so that I can play pickleball. [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9832.800000000001s)]
*  We need to get you on paddle, bro. [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9835.84s)]
*  You gotta go. [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9837.04s)]
*  You gotta go. [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9837.880000000001s)]
*  You gotta go. [[02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9838.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9839.560000000001s)]
*  Okay, that's cool. [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9840.400000000001s)]
*  Now that you have the joints, [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9841.240000000002s)]
*  you should absolutely stop playing pickle. [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9842.160000000002s)]
*  You play pickle with the boys. [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9843.68s)]
*  Did you beat his ass? [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9844.52s)]
*  I'll test his ass. [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9845.560000000001s)]
*  He's gonna do all the protocols. [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9846.400000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9847.220000000001s)]
*  That's true. [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9848.060000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9848.900000000001s)]
*  That's the tipping point. [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9849.740000000002s)]
*  Rip your shirt off afterward and he's in. [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9850.58s)]
*  That's the tipping point. [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9852.66s)]
*  Okay, so you're gonna get every single joint done. [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9853.96s)]
*  And can you tell me why we have to be concerned [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9856.74s)]
*  about some stem cells? [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9858.84s)]
*  Yeah, because they can lead to uncontrolled growth. [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9861.82s)]
*  Why, just getting them from shady places? [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9867.38s)]
*  Yeah, you just like, you wanna have quality controls [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9870.66s)]
*  around where they're from, how they're manufactured. [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9872.94s)]
*  Got it. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9875.7s)]
*  You just don't want to be, have a friend [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9876.52s)]
*  with a hookup with stem cells. [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9878.26s)]
*  Yeah, don't play games with the stem cells. [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9880.56s)]
*  Yeah. Got it. [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9881.82s)]
*  Yeah, any of these advanced therapies, [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9882.66s)]
*  like you really don't wanna play games. [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9883.8s)]
*  And then we hear a lot about stem cells. [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9885.24s)]
*  What is it that they actually do in the body? [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9887.24s)]
*  They're representing a more youthful state. [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9891.38s)]
*  They do the job of a more youthful state. [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9893.88s)]
*  So they rejuvenize the joints or they replace? [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9896.779999999999s)]
*  They rejuvenate. [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9901.1s)]
*  And how can you turn the clock back on the joint? [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9902.58s)]
*  Yeah, so that's what I, [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9905.32s)]
*  our objective is to get me to 18-year-old joints. [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9906.46s)]
*  Now that is, I think is kind of a ridiculous idea. [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9910.06s)]
*  I don't know if it's practically possible, [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9912.4s)]
*  but that's our objective. [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9913.859999999999s)]
*  And so we're wondering. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9914.699999999999s)]
*  Yet, not practically possible. [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9915.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but like, why not? [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9916.359999999999s)]
*  Like, why can't we set that goal? [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9917.46s)]
*  And can we try to give a go at this thing? [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9918.82s)]
*  But you need to like rebuild everything [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9920.699999999999s)]
*  because you lose bone over time. [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9921.9s)]
*  Like your body just deteriorates over time. [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9924.06s)]
*  You're trying to reverse that. [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9927.58s)]
*  And so we're trying to figure out to see what we can do. [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9928.779999999999s)]
*  Are you worried about microplastics? [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9932.3s)]
*  We are mindful of them, yes. [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9935.36s)]
*  Yeah, like we, so I built this blueprint food stack [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9937.28s)]
*  where we built a bunch of products. [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9939.92s)]
*  We're trying to be the most nutritious [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9942.2s)]
*  food protocol in history. [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9944.92s)]
*  So food in our society is very dirty. [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9947.12s)]
*  And I've become painfully aware of how dirty it is. [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9950.6s)]
*  Is it worse? What do you mean by dirty? [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9953.92s)]
*  And like, if you look at the testing profile of what's in it. [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9956.36s)]
*  You mean it just filled with horrible ingredients, right? [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9961.4s)]
*  Is American food the most poisonous in the world? [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9964.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9967.64s)]
*  The testing we've done, I've become acutely aware of this [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9968.8s)]
*  because we test our own foods. [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9972.48s)]
*  Like no one tests first. [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9975.2s)]
*  And then when you do test, like you're eating shit. [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9977.08s)]
*  Like you assume, like you pull up, [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9979.36s)]
*  it's like someone's got me, right? [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9981.1s)]
*  No. [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9983.36s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9984.44s)]
*  That has been terrifying. [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9985.48s)]
*  Is like, the shit is slipping through. [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9986.96s)]
*  That's my concern with like, [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9989.12s)]
*  or maybe it's why your system needs to be open [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9991.2s)]
*  and why it needs to be constantly verified [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9995.12s)]
*  because we could fall into the same trap [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9996.92s)]
*  that we're in with food. [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=9999.16s)]
*  Like all this health food is actually horrible for us, right? [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10000.320000000002s)]
*  So how do we make sure that the algorithm [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10003.800000000001s)]
*  doesn't get manipulated for the benefit of some people? [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10005.6s)]
*  Anyway, but go back to what you were saying. [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10008.720000000001s)]
*  So even good foods, you'll test and be like, [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10010.16s)]
*  good foods, quote unquote, but like whole foods [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10012.320000000002s)]
*  that are grown from a garden or something like that. [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10014.460000000001s)]
*  Are you noticing like, oh wow, [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10017.12s)]
*  even these have like bad traces in them? [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10018.240000000002s)]
*  For example, we were building a product called Super Veggie. [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10021.119999999999s)]
*  And so it's just basically, [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10025.039999999999s)]
*  how do you get someone on a clinically relevant dose, [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10025.88s)]
*  like three to six servings a day of veggies, [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10029.16s)]
*  and we put it together in a powder. [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10031.96s)]
*  So we started sourcing these powders [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10033.56s)]
*  like broccoli and cauliflower and carrot, [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10035.06s)]
*  and we get them and we'd look at the heavy metal [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10037.08s)]
*  and it'd be shockingly high. [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10039.56s)]
*  Yeah, and so we had to go back to the supplier and say, [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10042.519999999999s)]
*  are you aware of the situation? [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10045.76s)]
*  This is really terrible. [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10047.32s)]
*  So just even in us sourcing from the private supply chain, [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10048.68s)]
*  and what do they say? [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10052.04s)]
*  It's a wide range of responses. [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10053.84s)]
*  Like sometimes they don't know, [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10055.4s)]
*  sometimes they need to retest. [[02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10056.32s)]
*  So it's not like, again, the presumption is, [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10058.960000000001s)]
*  someone's got me. [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10063.08s)]
*  Systems are in place that are controlled, [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10064.880000000001s)]
*  that's not the case. [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10066.960000000001s)]
*  And so we've learned a whole lot. [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10067.78s)]
*  We actually did a 10,000 run of a product. [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10069.880000000001s)]
*  We found it high in lead, [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10073.6s)]
*  and I had to scrap the entire 10,000 run. [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10075.720000000001s)]
*  Oh no. Wow. [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10077.6s)]
*  Yeah, because we didn't verify soon enough. [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10079.2s)]
*  We took the vendor specs and said, great. [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10081.28s)]
*  We didn't verify before purchase. [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10083.4s)]
*  So we're learning a ton of stuff. [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10085.84s)]
*  How do you get the cleanest possible supply? [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10087.12s)]
*  Then we're also starting to publish our testing [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10088.800000000001s)]
*  to say, here's what the batch looks like. [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10090.84s)]
*  Even with our olive oil, we publish a COA to say, [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10093.32s)]
*  here's what the pesticide profile looks like, [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10096.04s)]
*  here's what the heavy metals look like. [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10097.68s)]
*  I do also think it's important branding-wise [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10099.36s)]
*  that people know you're not making any, [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10100.92s)]
*  you personally aren't making any profit on this. [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10103.12s)]
*  It just goes right back in. [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10104.960000000001s)]
*  Because that makes it all that much more trustworthy to me. [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10106.04s)]
*  Because I would look at you and be like, [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10108.16s)]
*  maybe he's just doing all this shit [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10110.24s)]
*  so he can just make billions again down the road [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10111.36s)]
*  with supplements and olive oils. [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10113.52s)]
*  So it's cool to know that you're not really profiting on it. [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10115.08s)]
*  Where are you sourcing your food that you consume? [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10118.08s)]
*  All over the world. [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10120.24s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, okay. [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10121.56s)]
*  Every, yeah. [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10122.48s)]
*  We have 130 or so ingredients we're sourcing. [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10123.96s)]
*  So how do you eat when you're here? [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10126.8s)]
*  Like you're on the road, you're traveling, [[02:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10128.039999999999s)]
*  I assume you're staying in like a hotel or something, [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10129.28s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10130.72s)]
*  Where do you eat and how do you eat? [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10131.72s)]
*  Yeah, I brought all my Blueprint food with me. [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10133.56s)]
*  Powder form? [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10136.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10137.52s)]
*  I'm curious about that. [[02:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10139.279999999999s)]
*  Like I've heard from people, [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10140.119999999999s)]
*  yeah, I don't know anything about this, [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10141.72s)]
*  but like smoothies, for example, [[02:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10142.96s)]
*  strip the fiber from the nutritious elements [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10144.96s)]
*  of like the actual fruits and things. [[02:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10147.48s)]
*  And I've heard from people that say, [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10148.8s)]
*  oh, you actually need the fiber [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10150.359999999999s)]
*  in conjunction with the nutrients. [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10151.68s)]
*  Is that true or is that not true? [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10153.52s)]
*  I mean, we think that, [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10155.64s)]
*  like we have a powder-based veggie product we're building. [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10157.56s)]
*  We think it's competitive with whole foods. [[02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10160.359999999999s)]
*  And so you know, vegetables and fruits are mostly water. [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10163.2s)]
*  If you take away the water, [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10168.0s)]
*  you keep the same nutritional content. [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10168.84s)]
*  And in many ways with the powdered foods, [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10170.720000000001s)]
*  if you have the right supply chain, [[02:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10172.720000000001s)]
*  you control for quality. [[02:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10174.08s)]
*  So you know exactly what you're getting [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10175.76s)]
*  versus if you have real foods, [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10177.12s)]
*  like that may be not prepared correctly [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10178.16s)]
*  or may have certain pesticides on it. [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10181.240000000002s)]
*  So it's not that it's powder is worse for you. [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10183.2s)]
*  For us it's a toss-up. [[02:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10186.44s)]
*  And so I'm on it myself to see what happens. [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10187.36s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10189.240000000002s)]
*  We want to see with my body when I'm doing this. [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10190.08s)]
*  So I have blueprint foods. [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10192.519999999999s)]
*  I'll probably, if I go out, [[02:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10194.359999999999s)]
*  I have a dinner later with people. [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10195.439999999999s)]
*  So I'll break my routine if I'm going out with friends, [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10196.8s)]
*  I'll want to socialize and be okay. [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10199.56s)]
*  If I have an empty plate, [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10201.439999999999s)]
*  nobody can talk about anything [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10203.48s)]
*  except for why I have an empty plate. [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10204.68s)]
*  And I don't want that to happen [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10206.0s)]
*  because everyone's there to socialize [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10206.84s)]
*  and say what they want to talk about. [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10208.24s)]
*  So I'll get some steamed vegetables or like some, [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10209.88s)]
*  or a salad just so I have food [[02:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10211.96s)]
*  and I'll kind of pick away at it. [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10213.76s)]
*  But I tried to do social norm compliance, [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10215.16s)]
*  like, hey everyone, we're cool, we're fine. [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10217.64s)]
*  We can focus on having fun together. [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10219.8s)]
*  Let's all make our jokes. [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10221.2s)]
*  Actually an important thing to include in the blueprint. [[02:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10222.400000000001s)]
*  How you can look normal while trying to not die. [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10225.68s)]
*  That is the most important thing. [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10229.400000000001s)]
*  Because as we were talking about earlier, [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10231.560000000001s)]
*  like socialization is crucial. [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10233.12s)]
*  And if you put yourself in a position [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10235.36s)]
*  where you're trying to not die, [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10236.880000000001s)]
*  but you've completely excommunicated yourself [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10237.92s)]
*  from all your friends, like that's gonna hurt you as well. [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10239.92s)]
*  And all your scores and everything are gonna go down. [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10242.320000000002s)]
*  So yeah, if it does mean, hey, [[02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10244.36s)]
*  if you're at a restaurant, just order this salad. [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10245.640000000001s)]
*  This is gonna affect your macros [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10248.12s)]
*  or however you calculate stuff in the smallest way. [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10250.28s)]
*  That is so important. [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10252.92s)]
*  Yes. [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10254.04s)]
*  It's like why Odools exists. [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10254.880000000001s)]
*  You don't wanna have to explain [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10257.800000000001s)]
*  or you wanna feel like you're one of the people. [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10259.28s)]
*  Or the soda with lime. [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10260.880000000001s)]
*  Soda with lime. [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10262.24s)]
*  Party soda with lime, you're drinking. [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10263.92s)]
*  Nobody's even asking a question. [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10265.2s)]
*  What about a relationship? [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10267.08s)]
*  Can you be with someone who's not on blueprint? [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10268.44s)]
*  Boy, that's complicated. [[02:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10272.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10273.36s)]
*  Yeah, I made this joke. [[02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10274.2s)]
*  You've created a new Mormonism. [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10281.0s)]
*  Only way you can be our friends, [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10287.04s)]
*  only way we can date, if you subscribe to all these rules. [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10288.44s)]
*  Wow, okay, go on now. [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10291.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, how do I even answer this? [[02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10292.640000000001s)]
*  Like, I guess, yeah, I think I'm kind of a statistical anomaly [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10295.04s)]
*  in terms of like my behaviors [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10299.880000000001s)]
*  and the way I think, the way I behave. [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10301.68s)]
*  And then if you say, what's the number of people [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10303.6s)]
*  that match up with that behavioral profile? [[02:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10305.64s)]
*  It's small. [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10307.92s)]
*  And so it's a complicated question, I don't know. [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10309.439999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's tricky. [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10313.08s)]
*  What about caffeine? [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10314.039999999999s)]
*  Do you have any room for caffeine in the protocol? [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10315.8s)]
*  I don't, I mean, caffeine's fine. [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10318.16s)]
*  I just find that it makes me go on a roller coaster [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10320.72s)]
*  and I get addicted to it pretty quickly. [[02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10323.24s)]
*  Oh, really? [[02:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10325.08s)]
*  So if someone was on the protocol and they were like, [[02:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10325.92s)]
*  hey, can I have a coffee in the morning? [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10327.439999999999s)]
*  Great. [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10328.92s)]
*  Really? [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10329.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'm really like, [[02:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10330.6s)]
*  this is just measure. [[02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10333.04s)]
*  Measure and do what's good for you, [[02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10334.76s)]
*  but like go to bed whenever you want, [[02:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10336.56s)]
*  drink caffeine if you want, eat meat if you want, [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10338.52s)]
*  like go out with friends, like just do your thing. [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10340.92s)]
*  Adhere to the data, though. [[02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10342.4s)]
*  Right. [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10343.6s)]
*  Yeah, the data's showing, yeah, [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10344.44s)]
*  you have this like wonky mood shift throughout the day, [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10345.4s)]
*  they go, okay, maybe caffeine isn't a thing for me. [[02:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10347.84s)]
*  Creatine? [[02:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10352.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, 2.5 milligrams a day, or 2.5 grams a day. [[02:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10353.64s)]
*  Yeah, some people go up to five or even higher. [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10357.64s)]
*  What about, I know you said no alcohol, [[02:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10361.2s)]
*  but what if the data shows the one glass of red wine [[02:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10363.72s)]
*  is beneficial or not hurting you? [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10366.4s)]
*  Can someone do that? [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10368.439999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I used to drink three ounces of wine every morning. [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10369.519999999999s)]
*  And the breakfast was some shit like that? [[02:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10371.8s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10373.839999999998s)]
*  Why? [[02:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10374.679999999998s)]
*  Because there are some benefits. [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10375.72s)]
*  There are some benefits to wine. [[02:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10377.96s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10380.16s)]
*  But it was 73 calories [[02:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10381.0s)]
*  and I couldn't afford the caloric intake. [[02:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10383.08s)]
*  Other calories provided a higher value [[02:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10384.519999999999s)]
*  if I stopped drinking the wine. [[02:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10386.0s)]
*  What about those pills? [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10388.56s)]
*  Didn't you have like an alcohol pill? [[02:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10389.8s)]
*  What happened with those? [[02:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10391.48s)]
*  So we are thinking about making them part [[02:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10393.72s)]
*  of the blueprint stack. [[02:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10394.88s)]
*  Can you explain to them what it is? [[02:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10396.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so basically we put two glasses of wine into a pill. [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10397.56s)]
*  It doesn't have the wine. [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10401.119999999999s)]
*  It just induces the effect of the wine. [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10403.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10406.759999999998s)]
*  What is it, like the methanol or something? [[02:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10407.96s)]
*  What is that in alcohol that gives you the sensation? [[02:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10409.92s)]
*  Is that what's in the pills? [[02:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10413.88s)]
*  It's just the health benefits of. [[02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10414.72s)]
*  Oh, it's not getting you drunk? [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10416.759999999998s)]
*  No. [[02:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10418.119999999999s)]
*  Oh, what the fuck is that in the pill? [[02:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10418.96s)]
*  So much less fun. [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10420.759999999998s)]
*  He's like, ruin your day. [[02:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10422.84s)]
*  Dude, I thought you figured it out. [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10425.56s)]
*  I was like, oh, dude. [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10427.48s)]
*  But like, that's the things, [[02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10430.199999999999s)]
*  that's something that you could look forward to. [[02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10431.32s)]
*  So dunking and then all kinds of mental experiences. [[02:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10432.64s)]
*  It's like, can you simulate being drunk? [[02:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10438.039999999999s)]
*  Can you simulate like all the things you enjoy? [[02:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10439.48s)]
*  I mean, if you can. [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10441.8s)]
*  Stop myself from being hungover. [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10442.64s)]
*  Like all, these are all things. [[02:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10444.119999999999s)]
*  Drink as much as I want, not be hungover. [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10445.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10447.599999999999s)]
*  How would we do that? [[02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10448.439999999999s)]
*  Just induce that state. [[02:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10449.439999999999s)]
*  I have friends working on that. [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10450.679999999998s)]
*  There's a lot of people that are working [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10453.0s)]
*  on the no hangover pill, which is a little scary [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10453.84s)]
*  because that just increases. [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10457.32s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10458.44s)]
*  I mean, if I'm like Bud Light [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10459.72s)]
*  or if I'm like some alcohol company, [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10461.16s)]
*  I'm putting all the research and development [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10462.64s)]
*  into no hangovers. [[02:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10464.84s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10465.8s)]
*  Because you sell way more [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10466.64s)]
*  of the hangover inducing product, right? [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10468.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10470.68s)]
*  Why are they not doing that? [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10471.52s)]
*  I know, I agree. [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10472.4s)]
*  Maybe they just haven't known the technology to do it. [[02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10473.68s)]
*  I mean, that's a zero moment. [[02:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10476.84s)]
*  You need a biologist. [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10478.039999999999s)]
*  That's the end of society. [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10478.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10480.08s)]
*  Here is a way AI wise to give us all the benefits [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10482.800000000001s)]
*  of the blueprint without having to change lifestyle. [[02:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10485.44s)]
*  Yes. [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10487.92s)]
*  Is that something you're pursuing [[02:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10488.76s)]
*  or is another company pursuing it? [[02:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10489.6s)]
*  Like maybe I don't have to sleep eight hours, [[02:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10491.400000000001s)]
*  but there's a helmet that can give me the same effects [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10493.76s)]
*  in an hour. [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10495.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's a little zambic, right? [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10496.52s)]
*  Yes. [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10497.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[02:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10498.560000000001s)]
*  And do you know of companies that are working on this? [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10499.380000000001s)]
*  Yes, everyone. [[02:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10500.720000000001s)]
*  And how I can invest in it? [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10501.560000000001s)]
*  Everyone knows nobody wants to do the hard work. [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10502.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10504.04s)]
*  Everybody wants to take a pill. [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10504.880000000001s)]
*  So yeah, there's a lot of money going into that. [[02:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10506.400000000001s)]
*  Okay, before we get out of here, [[02:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10509.0s)]
*  we could ask you questions about this forever [[02:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10510.560000000001s)]
*  but before we get out of here, [[02:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10512.88s)]
*  any last thoughts you'd like to leave us with? [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10513.72s)]
*  I love how this was more about AI than your daily routine. [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10517.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10521.32s)]
*  That was really surprising. [[02:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10522.16s)]
*  And I hope people tap into that. [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10523.44s)]
*  There's another layer to it. [[02:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10527.44s)]
*  There are tons of people who are like hacking [[02:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10528.52s)]
*  what you eat and how you work out, [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10529.96s)]
*  but using AI to do it and as being an expression [[02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10532.48s)]
*  of that synergy with AI is something really novel. [[02:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10536.92s)]
*  And potentially our only path to survival. [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10540.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of cool. [[02:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10542.16s)]
*  Okay, so what do you want to leave us with? [[02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10543.16s)]
*  Yeah, first I would say thank you. [[02:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10544.68s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[02:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10546.92s)]
*  Sure, thank you. [[02:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10547.76s)]
*  You guys were really cool. [[02:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10548.6s)]
*  I didn't know what to expect today [[02:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10549.8s)]
*  and like most of the interviews I've done [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10551.12s)]
*  over the past year since the things blow up [[02:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10552.96s)]
*  is very predictable, right? [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10555.24s)]
*  It's like what time you get up, [[02:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10557.36s)]
*  how many pills you take a day, [[02:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10558.52s)]
*  like tell me about your erections. [[02:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10560.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10561.28s)]
*  And that's why there's the appetite to talk about [[02:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10562.12s)]
*  this larger picture just really isn't there. [[02:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10564.82s)]
*  They just don't know, dude. [[02:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10567.8s)]
*  I think you need to tell them more about, [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10569.28s)]
*  like people only are aware of what you give them, right? [[02:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10570.560000000001s)]
*  Their expectation is what you serve them. [[02:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10573.68s)]
*  And in a lot of your marketing, [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10575.560000000001s)]
*  I don't see as much of the AI component [[02:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10579.04s)]
*  like you explained it now. [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10581.160000000002s)]
*  I have a totally different idea of who you are [[02:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10582.2s)]
*  after seeing this. [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10584.92s)]
*  I've heard it talked about in other podcasts, [[02:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10585.76s)]
*  but the other stuff is just so much easier [[02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10587.480000000001s)]
*  to get stuck to. [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10589.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10590.400000000001s)]
*  Like I've tried. [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10591.240000000002s)]
*  We're gonna talk more. [[02:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10593.640000000001s)]
*  So you need to figure out how to repackage it. [[02:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10594.480000000001s)]
*  We're gonna talk more afterwards, yeah. [[02:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10595.480000000001s)]
*  I mean, cool. [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10597.160000000002s)]
*  I would love your take on that. [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10598.8s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10599.64s)]
*  I've tried very hard, but I would just say, [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10600.48s)]
*  yeah, I appreciate you guys because [[02:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10602.279999999999s)]
*  if we could really internalize the possibility [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10605.32s)]
*  of how extraordinary existence could be, [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10609.519999999999s)]
*  and we could fully occupy that, [[02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10613.56s)]
*  we may be willing to drop everything. [[02:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10616.72s)]
*  Everything. [[02:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10621.759999999998s)]
*  That's terrifying. [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10622.599999999999s)]
*  Everything to have this. [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10623.439999999999s)]
*  I mean, everything we're attached to, [[02:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10624.759999999998s)]
*  our identities, our status, our power, [[02:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10626.6s)]
*  everything we care about, [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10629.359999999999s)]
*  we may be willing to say we're in. [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10631.48s)]
*  And it's the biggest jump of faith [[02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10635.119999999999s)]
*  that the species has ever been asked to take. [[02:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10638.74s)]
*  And it's the most terrifying thing [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10641.98s)]
*  we could ever imagine doing. [[02:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10643.92s)]
*  That's just not us. [[02:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10645.68s)]
*  We like to step into known things for the most part. [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10647.279999999999s)]
*  Like there are at times in life where we feel adventurous. [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10650.16s)]
*  We go to college and there's like a new thing. [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10653.16s)]
*  We get to merger and we get married, I have a baby. [[02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10655.88s)]
*  But still it's a thing that relatively, [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10658.119999999999s)]
*  we can model other people's experiences and say, [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10659.76s)]
*  it's gonna be roughly like this thing. [[02:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10662.359999999999s)]
*  Whereas this, there's no one that can tell us [[02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10664.34s)]
*  what it's gonna be like. [[02:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10666.8s)]
*  Right. [[02:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10668.0s)]
*  One guy. [[02:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10668.84s)]
*  You're doing your best. [[02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10669.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10670.5s)]
*  So yeah, I appreciate that. [[02:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10671.8s)]
*  The more we can talk about this as a society, [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10673.199999999999s)]
*  it's gonna take all of us. [[02:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10676.5s)]
*  I learned this a couple of years back. [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10677.439999999999s)]
*  I was teaching my son how to swim. [[02:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10679.22s)]
*  And I did a quick Google search of [[02:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10682.519999999999s)]
*  how do you teach a kid how to swim? [[02:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10684.720000000001s)]
*  And I don't know if there's any science behind this. [[02:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10686.68s)]
*  I just read this article [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10689.16s)]
*  that you can think about it three ways. [[02:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10690.380000000001s)]
*  One, you could get in the pool yourself [[02:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10691.62s)]
*  and say, jump to me. [[02:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10693.66s)]
*  The second is you can push them into the pool. [[02:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10695.4s)]
*  And the third is you can show them their friend swimming. [[02:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10698.16s)]
*  And they said the best way, show them their friend. [[02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10702.0s)]
*  Because we all want to be part of the tribe. [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10705.36s)]
*  We want to be with our friends. [[02:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10708.2s)]
*  We want to be respected. [[02:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10709.74s)]
*  We want to be there. [[02:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10711.0s)]
*  And if we could lock in [[02:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10713.18s)]
*  when these existential moments of AI crisis happen, [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10716.82s)]
*  and we say, what the fuck? [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10720.62s)]
*  What now? [[02:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10723.720000000001s)]
*  If we can pull up and say, [[02:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10725.06s)]
*  we have a new game to play and we're ready to play it. [[02:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10726.36s)]
*  That to me would be the most extraordinary thing [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10729.02s)]
*  we could do. [[02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10731.1s)]
*  And that's what I think we in our 25th century states [[02:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10732.36s)]
*  would say, we did it. [[02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10736.5s)]
*  We were prescient, we were present, and we sought. [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10738.800000000001s)]
*  And we stepped into it when it came up. [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10742.359999999999s)]
*  So if we can, the species doing it. [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10744.699999999999s)]
*  And that's very hard. [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10746.599999999999s)]
*  Everyone's very busy and we're all locked in on our games. [[02:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10747.439999999999s)]
*  So it's a big ask, but I really think we can do it. [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10749.9s)]
*  Well, I'm looking forward to see what's happening. [[02:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10754.88s)]
*  Thank you for sharing your perspective with us, man. [[02:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10756.939999999999s)]
*  Appreciate you. [[02:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10758.88s)]
*  Brian Johnson, everybody. [[02:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10759.72s)]
*  Go check him out. [[02:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10762.64s)]
*  He's all over YouTube. [[02:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAwePw-prCE&t=10763.519999999999s)]
