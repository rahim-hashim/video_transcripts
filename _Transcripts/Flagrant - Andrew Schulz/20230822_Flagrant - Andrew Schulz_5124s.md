**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [August 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM)
*  Bro, Max is one of the few guys I think we've had on that's fought Conor. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=0.0s)]
*  In that fight, he took me down. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2.92s)]
*  I had him in half guard and I had like his ankle. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4.26s)]
*  And when I went in and passed, I like hit. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=6.92s)]
*  That's how he hurt his knee in the fight. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=8.76s)]
*  And he screamed and went, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=10.26s)]
*  Ah! [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=11.1s)]
*  Like a hurtful scream. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=11.94s)]
*  I'm on the bottom, holding him, I was like, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=13.98s)]
*  Oh, you okay? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=15.36s)]
*  He's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, keep fighting, mate. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=16.2s)]
*  No, no, he didn't! [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=17.48s)]
*  No, no, he didn't! [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=18.32s)]
*  DC's a sellout. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  Fucked him up. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=21.2s)]
*  He's the worst, bro. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=21.94s)]
*  He's lucky he's the heavyweight champion, something in the world. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=22.740000000000002s)]
*  Because other than that, you're nothing to me. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  You think you got DC with the hands, if it's just hands? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=27.580000000000002s)]
*  Brother, I got him the wrestling, the eating, whatever you want. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=29.78s)]
*  Drop, DC, wherever you are. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=33.28s)]
*  The cops probably know my car, because it's just a loud ass car. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=34.7s)]
*  Wait, what is it? What's the car? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  It's like a matte red, but it's shiny. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=38.24s)]
*  It's like a chrome finish. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=39.96s)]
*  What kind of car? What kind of car? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=41.8s)]
*  It's a Tesla X. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=43.46s)]
*  An electric car. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=44.42s)]
*  It's the quietest car. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=45.42s)]
*  It's the quietest car. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=46.84s)]
*  Before we begin and talk so much about, obviously, what you got going on, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=49.56s)]
*  I know we got a big announcement from you, etc. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=52.6s)]
*  Can you explain why and I to people who have never been to Hawaii, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=54.74s)]
*  even people who have been to Honolulu and stuff? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=60.54s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=63.2s)]
*  Because I think it's a very specific part of Hawaii, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=63.7s)]
*  in that I think it's the only part that's not gentrified at all. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=68.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  It's super authentic local. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=73.62s)]
*  It's getting scary, though. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=75.62s)]
*  Wait, what you mean? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=76.66s)]
*  I mean, it's getting, bro. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=77.46000000000001s)]

*  The Howlies are coming, bro? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=80.28s)]
*  Are we scooping it up? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=82.16s)]
*  I know. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=83.17999999999999s)]
*  You and your people, what the hell are you doing, bro? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=83.67999999999999s)]
*  With that haircut. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=86.17999999999999s)]
*  I know. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=87.17999999999999s)]
*  But yeah, bro, I mean, to explain why and I to you this way. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  You're not going to like it, but the coffee gets better, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=92.42s)]
*  the dessert gets better, the cupcakes. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=94.82s)]
*  They got the good coffee in Hawaii. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=96.17999999999999s)]
*  They got cupcakes. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=97.62s)]
*  The cupcakes are solid, dude. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=98.12s)]
*  The cupcakes get better. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=99.12s)]
*  Let's just keep everything better on the Honolulu side. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=99.92s)]
*  They haven't even got Wi-Fi over there. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=102.12s)]
*  Brother. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=103.32s)]
*  OK, OK, so tell me. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=104.16s)]
*  Tell me. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=105.12s)]
*  If I had to explain why and I, I would be like, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=105.62s)]
*  it would be a place where a person would literally [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=107.86s)]
*  give you the back of their, the shirt off their back, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=110.54s)]
*  or you come there and you just get beaten up. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=114.34s)]
*  There's only two sides. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=116.64s)]
*  There's the middle. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=118.14s)]
*  You're either going to get beaten up [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=119.14s)]
*  or you're going to get a shirt. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  It's how you, that side of the island, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=121.64s)]
*  it's like a lot of people look at you like this, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=125.36000000000001s)]
*  and I mean, and like people take it wrong, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=127.4s)]
*  because that side of the island, it's always sunny. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=129.14000000000001s)]
*  It's just the sun in our eyes. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=131.04000000000002s)]
*  It's the sun in our eyes. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=134.44s)]
*  It's not you guys, so just be nice. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=135.54000000000002s)]
*  If you be nice, people are going to be nice. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=138.24s)]
*  They're going to welcome you, but if you give a little attitude. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=139.98s)]
*  It's on. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=142.38s)]
*  Brother, I was telling my guy over here, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=143.48s)]
*  he's talking to me off camera about some situation. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=146.18s)]
*  I told him, bro, if I was with you, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=149.57999999999998s)]
*  I would have told that guy back the hell up. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=150.98s)]
*  I don't give a shit who you are. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=153.18s)]
*  You would have got slapped. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=154.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=155.57999999999998s)]
*  I'd slap you if I knew what it is. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=156.57999999999998s)]
*  So are you still in situations where you got to throw down [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=158.57999999999998s)]
*  even now? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=162.78s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=163.57999999999998s)]
*  Nobody's testing you out there. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=164.18s)]
*  Everybody's cool, bro. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=165.78s)]
*  I'd be nice, that's why. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=166.68s)]
*  You'd be nice to everybody. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=167.68s)]
*  But then it comes back and no, no, they all love it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=168.78s)]
*  You can walk around there without getting harassed. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=171.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=175.28s)]
*  It's like the best way to explain it is like LeBron in Ohio. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=175.88s)]
*  When you go out there, everybody's like, that's fucking LeBron. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=179.88s)]
*  They see him all the time at 8 Cron. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=183.08s)]
*  They see him every time. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=184.78s)]
*  That's just how I am. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=185.98s)]
*  Because they've known you since you were a kid. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=187.08s)]
*  A kid. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=188.78s)]
*  They saw me since I was two. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=189.18s)]
*  One in elementary, one in intermediate, one in high school. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=190.68s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=193.18s)]
*  Do and do. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=193.68s)]
*  You know? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=194.18s)]
*  Born and raised out there. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=194.98s)]
*  So at the end of the day, it's just sitting there. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=195.88s)]
*  That's the wildest thing for me because most people reach your superstardom and they will move. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=198.58s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=206.88000000000002s)]
*  Especially in MMA. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=207.28s)]
*  A lot of people will go to one of the big MMA gyms in America. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=208.38000000000002s)]
*  What was it? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=211.68s)]
*  America Top Team. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=212.28s)]
*  There's a few of them. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=214.18s)]
*  What is the one in Denver that I think it's Usman training out of there, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=214.88000000000002s)]
*  Gateshe's training out of there. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=220.08s)]
*  I don't know what it is in there, bro. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=221.48000000000002s)]
*  I don't even know the MMA. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=222.58s)]
*  I'm terrible, bro. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=223.88000000000002s)]
*  I'm so far apart of the MMA. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=224.78s)]
*  If you ask me about video games, I'm talking about every single game. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=226.28s)]
*  Every streamer, every step. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=228.48s)]
*  I'm saying you didn't move and I thought it was an interesting thing. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=230.88s)]

*  because I landed the only punch in the fight. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=388.28s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=389.88s)]
*  Like my younger brother was a fighter. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=390.47999999999996s)]
*  So like, you know, long story short, if when I started kickboxing or whatever, my cousin, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=392.97999999999996s)]

*  And there's like, you mean, Clem. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=402.88s)]

*  They thought my younger brother was a fighter. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=405.58s)]
*  So I ended up becoming the fighter. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=408.58s)]
*  I have no idea why. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=410.78s)]
*  Maybe I was smarter. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=411.88s)]
*  My younger brother was just bronze, I guess. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=412.58s)]
*  And I guess I was the brain. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=414.48s)]
*  So there's a thing in Hawaii that's so interesting. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=415.58s)]
*  It's like the kindest, sweetest, most welcoming people that also will fight. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=418.78s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=424.68s)]
*  Can explain how that comes together? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=425.18s)]
*  Because I've never met a Hawaiian that I thought was pussy, but never once. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=427.38s)]
*  Every one of them is like the sweetest, kindest guy. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=432.58s)]
*  He was like, oh, yeah, my shoulders fucked up. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=434.58s)]

*  I just had to murder this guy. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=436.68s)]
*  It was like, how does that happen? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=438.08s)]
*  How are you the nicest people and also fighting as like part of the culture and integral? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=440.88s)]

*  It's the culture, bro. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=446.18s)]
*  I think so back in the day, you know, with Hawaiian culture was a lot of it was hand-to-hand combat. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=446.97999999999996s)]
*  We didn't really have weapons until somebody came and colonized us. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=452.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=456.28s)]

*  It's in our blood. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=466.18s)]
*  You know, we have our own fighting style. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=466.88s)]

*  Remember that girl? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=534.48s)]
*  That girl was impressive, bro. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=535.18s)]
*  That was impressive. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=537.28s)]
*  She lost her job because of how crazy is that? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=538.18s)]
*  Yeah, she lost her job because of that. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=540.38s)]
*  A female football league that'll probably hire her, you know what I mean? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=541.48s)]
*  Dana White hired her. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=543.78s)]
*  I think Dana White hired her as a security guard for a little while. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=545.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=548.28s)]

*  She got fired from Walmart. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=551.68s)]
*  Oh, Best Buy, it was Best Buy. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=552.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=554.18s)]
*  Because you can't do that. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=554.4799999999999s)]
*  I'm like, can't do what? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=555.28s)]
*  Somebody was stealing your red card? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=556.5799999999999s)]
*  What's her job? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=557.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=558.78s)]
*  There are worse things that could happen than getting fired from Walmart, though. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=559.68s)]
*  I'll tell you that right now. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=562.38s)]
*  I think she's going to be okay. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=563.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=564.18s)]
*  Did you ever have fights in baseball? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=564.9799999999999s)]
*  Like, there'd be like a baseball, like all the benches clear and then you just go with brawl or what? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=566.4799999999999s)]
*  No, I never did. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=569.5799999999999s)]
*  I never did. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=570.38s)]
*  So you never fought. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=570.9799999999999s)]
*  Your little brother's fighting. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=572.4799999999999s)]
*  Why even? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=573.98s)]
*  I'm trying to understand like why even go for it? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=574.58s)]
*  Why even try it out? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=576.88s)]
*  Why even seek it? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=577.88s)]
*  Like, what was this part of you? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=578.88s)]
*  I mean, there's this thing, you know, when UFC Hawaii, when the UFC gyms came to Hawaii, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=580.58s)]
*  there's this meme going around. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=586.38s)]
*  There's like, this is not the first UFC gym. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=587.88s)]
*  There's this meme of the Wina High School, the picture of the high school I went to is like, this was the first UFC gym. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=589.98s)]
*  So I just wanted to be able to protect myself. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=594.98s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=597.58s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=598.08s)]
*  I just wanted to know, like, I just wanted to be like, oh, bro, somebody wanted to test me in school or something. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=598.78s)]
*  And like, it's okay. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=602.78s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=604.18s)]
*  Like, I don't have to like call my younger brother. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=604.68s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=606.68s)]
*  Younger brother. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=607.68s)]
*  My little bro will fuck you up. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=608.38s)]
*  You have to protect yourself. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=611.98s)]
*  So I was just thinking like, bro, I just want to do this to protect myself. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=612.98s)]
*  I remember in 10th grade, I ended up, one of my good friends, this guy named Josh Keanu, he was training and he was fighting. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=616.28s)]
*  So he said, oh yeah, come. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=624.98s)]
*  So after baseball season, I remember it was a Wednesday, I went with him, trained, did the sparring, everything. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=626.0799999999999s)]
*  Did all right because on Thursday, I got asked if I wanted to fight on Saturday because he was fighting. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=631.78s)]
*  Oh, so your first day training. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=635.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=637.48s)]
*  And then they asked me, you want to fight? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=637.98s)]
*  I was like, I was like, hell yeah. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=639.28s)]
*  I was like, in my mind, it made perfect sense. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=641.28s)]
*  It made perfect sense because I was more scared of asking my grandparents for my grandma for $35 to go watch the fight. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=643.28s)]
*  That's how much it cost. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=650.48s)]
*  But then if I fought in it, it was going to be the first fight. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=651.68s)]
*  I get in for free. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=653.78s)]
*  And you know what I mean? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=655.0799999999999s)]
*  Like, it is what it is. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=656.0799999999999s)]
*  Win-win. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=656.98s)]
*  I get to watch my friend fight. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=657.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=659.48s)]
*  You lost the deal. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=660.18s)]
*  Hey, Casie Krenner, are you sure you're the brains of your family? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=661.48s)]
*  I like to think it. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=666.08s)]
*  You're at it for free. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=668.38s)]
*  Spend $35,000, get in for free, you know? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=669.08s)]
*  And then I didn't even ask my grandma about it anymore. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=671.18s)]
*  I just had to go to my mom and my mom is kind of crazy. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=673.68s)]
*  And then I told my mom, I'm going to fight. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=676.58s)]
*  And the only thing that she told me, she was like, so are you going to win? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=678.78s)]
*  I was like, I don't know. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=683.58s)]
*  She better win. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=685.08s)]
*  I was like, okay. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=686.08s)]
*  I ended up winning. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=686.88s)]
*  I remember I ended up winning. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=688.38s)]
*  K-1 was big at the time when I was 10th grade. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=690.38s)]
*  And I wanted to be a K-1 kickboxer, you know, Abu Akhali and whatever. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=692.38s)]
*  I was like, I want to be like this. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=696.08s)]
*  Two years later, freaking the whole BJ Pan era happened. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=697.88s)]
*  He was fighting George St. Pierre. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=701.08s)]
*  I remember him. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=702.48s)]
*  I remember his purse leaking was like $30,000 at the time or $60,000, something crazy. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=703.48s)]
*  And I was like, oh, that's a lot of money. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=708.68s)]
*  Freak, this kickboxing stuff. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=710.68s)]
*  We got to get into MMA. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=712.08s)]
*  Only to bamboozle myself thinking $60,000 was a lot of money, you know? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=713.08s)]
*  It would make a lot more to be living. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=716.58s)]
*  It's good. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=720.08s)]
*  Damn. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=721.08s)]
*  Is your younger brother a fighter? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=721.58s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=723.08s)]
*  He really doesn't fight at all? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=724.08s)]
*  No, he don't fight at all. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=725.08s)]
*  He tried to, but yeah, he just didn't fight at all. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=726.08s)]
*  Do you remember the moment when you were like, oh, I love this. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=728.08s)]
*  I fucking love this. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=731.08s)]
*  Was it the first fight or was it something else? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=732.08s)]
*  Was, was, I had to be the first fight, you know what I mean? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=735.08s)]
*  Actually, it was like the first sparring on that Wednesday. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=740.08s)]
*  That day I told you I got hit. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=743.08s)]
*  And I remember to myself, I got to punch this motherfucker back. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=745.08s)]
*  That's the first thing that went through my mind. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=748.08s)]
*  I got to punch this. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=749.58s)]
*  And then after my first fight, I got kicked in the face like three times. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=750.58s)]
*  So how big my nose looked, this thing is like three times bigger. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=755.58s)]
*  And I remember looking in the mirror being like, oh my gosh, my nose is huge. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=759.58s)]
*  But I remember thinking like, this was fun. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=764.58s)]
*  I need to do this again. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=767.58s)]
*  I was like, this is fun. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=769.58s)]
*  This was my heart. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=771.58s)]
*  Have you ever, because that's one of the things people say about you is that you have the best chin in fight sports. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=774.08s)]
*  Have you ever been rocked? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=780.08s)]
*  Brother, I'd knock on wood. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=782.08s)]
*  I mean, probably, but I don't know. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=783.58s)]
*  You're talking from the heart. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=785.58s)]
*  I guess, I can honestly say. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=787.58s)]
*  Has there ever been a time where you were like, okay. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=789.58s)]
*  The Andre Feely fight, I can honestly say. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=791.58s)]
*  I mean, a lot of people would watch and be like, oh, the Dustin Poirier fight. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=794.58s)]
*  I mean, even sometimes Dustin says it, but then the second Dustin Poirier fight. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=797.58s)]
*  Everybody's like, oh yeah, he never got dropped. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=802.08s)]
*  And then I hear people like, yeah, because the fence saved him. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=803.58s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=807.58s)]
*  Because I was going back, right? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=808.58s)]
*  But I was like, okay, let's fucking make make believe. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=810.08s)]
*  And my wings came out. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=813.08s)]
*  I started flying against the stuff. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=814.08s)]
*  We were talking about make believe land. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=815.08s)]
*  The cage is there for a reason. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=816.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=817.58s)]
*  You knew the cage was there. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=818.58s)]
*  Come on. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=820.58s)]
*  So at the end of the day, it's just like, that one wasn't too much. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=821.58s)]
*  I know I got hit and I knew the cage was going to have my back sooner or later. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=824.58s)]
*  So that's why. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=828.08s)]
*  But then with Andre Feely, I remember getting hit one time. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=830.58s)]
*  He cracked me at something. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=835.08s)]
*  I don't even know what he hit me with. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=836.08s)]
*  I remember looking up at the scrubber I was in, Baltimore. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=837.58s)]
*  And I was looking at the time and I was thinking to myself, what the hell am I doing right now? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=841.58s)]
*  I was like, why am I looking at Ty? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=846.58s)]
*  I should be looking at this guy. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=848.08s)]
*  So that's probably one of the times ever. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=849.58s)]
*  Okay, so that's the only time you remember you actually got cracked. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=851.08s)]
*  I got hit. I was looking up. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=853.58s)]
*  You got distracted. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=855.08s)]
*  Yeah, I was distracted. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=856.08s)]
*  I was like, why am I looking at the time? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=857.08s)]
*  I need to be looking at this guy. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=858.58s)]
*  That was the main time. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=860.58s)]
*  Okay, the kick you took, you took a kick against, what's his name? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=862.08s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=867.08s)]
*  Yair? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=867.58s)]
*  Yeah, against Yair, the head kick. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=868.08s)]
*  And just ate it. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=870.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=871.08s)]
*  Nothing? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=872.08s)]
*  Brother, no, nothing. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=873.08s)]
*  I just was tripping up because I literally, I was literally nose to nose. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=874.08s)]
*  Did you see how close we were? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=877.58s)]
*  I was just surprised he got it that high. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=879.08s)]
*  In my mind, I was thinking like, what the fuck? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=880.58s)]
*  You know when you see those comedy movies and you just see something like, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=882.58s)]
*  you're looking at him legs and arms and spine. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=885.58s)]
*  What did he hit me with? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=888.08s)]
*  I was like, was that a kick? I was just tripping. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=889.58s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=918.08s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=919.08s)]

*  How much of you is assessing what is going on? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1000.58s)]
*  Oh, bro, a lot. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1003.08s)]
*  I think a lot. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1004.08s)]
*  A lot of times I catch myself in there just thinking like, bro, what is this and that? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1005.08s)]
*  You got to break down. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1008.08s)]
*  But then sometimes you just ask yourself, like, really? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1009.08s)]
*  Like, I remember we were just talking off screen. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1011.08s)]
*  No, we were talking off screen of when he was saying like, when you train with someone [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1014.08s)]
*  who's not as good as you and what happens, you know? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1020.08s)]
*  So like, I remember fighting Kader, you know what I mean? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1023.08s)]
*  Like, and he's a beast, don't get me wrong. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1027.08s)]
*  But then some of his jabs, like when he first threw his first jab out there, I was like, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1029.08s)]
*  oh, this jab is like, it wasn't fast. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1033.08s)]
*  I was thinking that it's not that fast. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1035.08s)]
*  And then he started catching me with it. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1036.08s)]
*  I was like, what the, I was like, what are you doing, Max? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1038.08s)]
*  And slip this jab. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1040.08s)]
*  I could see it coming at me. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1041.08s)]
*  And I was watching this hit me, boom, boom. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1042.08s)]
*  I was like, bro, what is going on? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1044.08s)]
*  So I'm about to. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1046.08s)]
*  It's an off speed pitch. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1047.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1048.08s)]
*  What do you think it is? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1049.08s)]
*  It was just timing? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1050.08s)]
*  It was just, yeah, I thought so. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1051.08s)]
*  I was just watching. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1052.08s)]
*  I was like, I can slip this. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1053.08s)]
*  And hit me. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1054.08s)]
*  I was like, what is going on? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1055.08s)]
*  So I can't say what it is. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1056.08s)]
*  I just think so that sometimes it's just you in there. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1058.08s)]
*  I probably was over assessing. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1061.08s)]
*  And then the whole time with that fight, he was talking the load, man. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1062.08s)]
*  Really? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1067.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1068.08s)]
*  But the build up. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1069.08s)]
*  To the build up. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1070.08s)]
*  Not when you were fighting him that much. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1071.08s)]
*  No, to the build up, bro. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1072.08s)]
*  I remember he's calling me a freshman and telling me, is this talking so much? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1073.08s)]
*  Dale was claiming he was the best boxer ever. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1079.08s)]
*  Yeah, you were hyped on that. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1081.08s)]
*  I was tripping out. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1082.08s)]
*  Even my fight with the last fight with Arnold, Dale was claiming he was a better boxer. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1083.08s)]
*  I was like, are we watching the same film? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1088.08s)]
*  I don't know what's going on. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1090.08s)]
*  That's what I'm thinking. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1091.08s)]
*  That's just what I'm thinking in my mind. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1092.08s)]
*  What do you think is your competitive advantage? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1095.08s)]
*  What is the strength for you specifically when you're in there? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1100.08s)]
*  When you're up against another guy, do you know exactly how you're going to beat them? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1103.08s)]
*  Do you know why you're better? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1107.08s)]
*  Is it timing punches? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1108.08s)]
*  Is it countering? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1109.08s)]
*  Is it distance? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1110.08s)]
*  I think it's confidence. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1111.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's confidence. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1112.08s)]
*  I think it's confidence. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1113.08s)]
*  I think it's confidence. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1115.08s)]
*  Knowing that anywhere this place go, I know I can compete with you. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1116.08s)]
*  I'll be fine with you. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1119.08s)]
*  That's the main thing I'm thinking. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1120.08s)]
*  I'm just like, bro, I'm going to compete with you wherever we go. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1121.08s)]
*  I don't give a shit what you want to do, where we want to go. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1124.08s)]
*  You want to go to the ground, I'll grab you. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1127.08s)]
*  So you feel comfortable on the ground? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1129.08s)]
*  Anywhere. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1130.08s)]
*  Really? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1131.08s)]
*  Yeah, anywhere. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1132.08s)]
*  So there's not one zone where you go, that is where, because it seems like when it's [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1133.08s)]
*  striking, when it's the hands, and you get into that flow, I don't know, it just feels [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1136.08s)]

*  it's a funny movement, and then he screamed. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1209.08s)]

*  And then they're fighting me, like in my mind, I think I'm this person, the greatest ever, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1237.08s)]

*  there so I don't keep punching you in the side. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1268.08s)]

*  I want to fight for at least maybe six more years, five more years, and I'm pushing it. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1391.08s)]
*  We'll see where the career goes. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1397.08s)]
*  But I told DC, you only really have that to have a career outside of fighting. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1399.08s)]
*  Because after that, I'm going to take every single job. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1402.08s)]
*  Whatever job DC has, he wants to be a garbage man in his town. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1404.08s)]
*  I'm going to move there. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1409.08s)]

*  I'm going to take DC job. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1420.08s)]
*  I don't think DC knows what's coming, bro. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1422.08s)]
*  He don't. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1424.08s)]

*  God damn. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1429.08s)]
*  I can't sleep, bro. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1430.08s)]
*  The game's going stop. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1431.08s)]
*  I've never seen somebody dislike somebody but do it in a pleasant way. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1432.08s)]
*  It's Hawaii, bro. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1436.08s)]

*  This is it. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1438.08s)]
*  I love DC, that's why, but you got to pay. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1439.08s)]
*  Would you have gone to wherever they shoot the show? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1443.08s)]
*  Would you have lived out of there or worked out of there? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1447.08s)]
*  I mean, that's the hard thing. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1449.08s)]
*  At the end of the day, I think so they would have, but no, it's not because DC does all [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1450.08s)]

*  His background is a TV that he changes any time. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1459.08s)]
*  DC calls me up, like, go, Max, one day he's shooting the show. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1461.08s)]

*  He's a fraud. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1475.08s)]

*  Is that right? [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1477.08s)]

*  And then it comes to thinking, like, his teammate is Islam, you know what I mean? [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1484.08s)]
*  And like one day maybe I want to fight Islam, so I can't be training with the guy. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=1485.08s)]

*  I just was asking for, I actually had a, I had a friend that lived with me. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2025.68s)]
*  So most of my drills, I could do them with him anyway, because we had a mat. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2030.68s)]
*  And then most of the Zoom training was just them telling me, we just was going over certain, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2034.68s)]
*  like our game plan for certain fighters, you know, and then what drills I need to be doing. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2040.68s)]
*  And then most of them was just making sure I was training. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2044.68s)]
*  You know, like a lot of the times, like they just want me to be able to do it. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2047.68s)]
*  Like a lot of the times, like they just wanted to see, you are not training, you know? [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2049.68s)]
*  Turn on your camera. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2053.68s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2054.68s)]
*  We tried to get away with not putting the camera on sometimes, but. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2055.68s)]
*  So you have, you have like a treadmill? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2057.68s)]
*  Like how are you getting the cardio in? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2059.68s)]
*  I was just, I was just running outside on the road. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2060.68s)]
*  Okay. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2062.68s)]
*  Like right in front of my house, just up and down. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2063.68s)]
*  Just back and forth. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2064.68s)]
*  Just sprints. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2065.68s)]

*  And we had like a little hill, so we should do that. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2069.68s)]
*  You like gaming too much? [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2070.68s)]

*  And then they see you on Twitch, just streaming and shit? [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2072.68s)]
*  Snitch on yourself. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2075.68s)]
*  That technically is, is training. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2076.68s)]
*  Hand-eye coordination. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2078.68s)]
*  You know, it's not good for my, my back cause I'm hunching over so much, but. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2079.68s)]
*  Okay. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2085.68s)]
*  Is it true? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2086.68s)]
*  I think you were saying that on Rogan that you use the game. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2087.68s)]
*  Oh bro, yeah. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2091.68s)]
*  To prepare for opponents? [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2092.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2093.68s)]
*  So no, no, I didn't use them to prepare for opponents. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2094.68s)]
*  So what happened was when UFC 2 came out. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2096.68s)]
*  Okay. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2099.68s)]
*  I was playing it, right? [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2100.68s)]
*  I would use Baral and Henen. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2101.68s)]
*  And, and bro, there was like some moves I was pushing together. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2103.68s)]
*  I was like, holy shit, this move is actually working. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2106.68s)]
*  And it would go and we'd just do it. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2108.68s)]
*  Like me and Dustin Kimura at the time, he was, he was a, he was a UFC vet. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2110.68s)]
*  But me and him was like, we'd hold myths. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2114.68s)]
*  I would hold myths for him and hopefully he'd hold myths for me, you know? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2116.68s)]
*  Like I'll teach him cause we didn't have a striking coach. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2119.68s)]
*  So I was like, oh look bro, let's do this. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2121.68s)]
*  So we named couple, although we named couple, like we had a combination that was called the Henen. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2123.68s)]
*  So I was like, oh, secret word. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2127.68s)]
*  So it was pretty cool. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2128.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2129.68s)]
*  So it actually, actually helped. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2130.68s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2131.68s)]
*  I mean, helped me give me ideas of certain striking. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2132.68s)]
*  I didn't learn how to throw a one-two from it. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2134.68s)]
*  It was like, oh my God, you learned fighting. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2136.68s)]
*  I'm like, I knew how to fight. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2139.68s)]
*  I just learned new combinations. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2141.68s)]
*  How effective are those moves in real fights? [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2142.68s)]
*  Pretty good. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2144.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2145.68s)]
*  One of them was like, I used to do this move was kind of irritating with Henen in it was like a jab and a front kick to the face. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2146.68s)]
*  At the same time. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2151.68s)]
*  So you jab and a jab front kick it in the face at the same time. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2152.68s)]
*  Same as that time. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2155.68s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2156.68s)]
*  So it's like, that was pretty good. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2157.68s)]
*  Although one was the regular although like a body shot to leg kick. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2159.68s)]
*  So it's fine. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2162.68s)]
*  Is there ever a time where you're like in your whole career where you've thought I'd like to do one training camp at a traditional gym? [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2163.68s)]
*  Like in Florida or in one of these things. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2174.68s)]
*  Never. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2177.68s)]
*  You never want to be away from home. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2178.68s)]
*  Never, bro. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2179.68s)]
*  Never. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2180.68s)]
*  Because I. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2181.68s)]
*  The pressure of being home and being that famous and having all these people. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2182.68s)]
*  No, no pressure. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2185.68s)]
*  I feel no pressure. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2186.68s)]
*  No pressure. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2187.68s)]
*  At the end of the day. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2188.68s)]
*  Was anything I felt I was like I was like a big F you to everybody because everybody when I told everybody what I want to do and how I want to do it. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2189.68s)]
*  There's like, oh, you're gonna have to move to the mainland to do that to to to hit the level that I want to hit because I was telling him what I wanted to do. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2196.68s)]
*  And I was like, no, you don't. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2202.68s)]
*  All you need is a good bunch of guys that's willing to learn, willing to train. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2204.68s)]
*  They don't even have to be the best guys in the world. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2208.68s)]
*  If you guys all have the same idea, the same stuff, same end goal, it's going to happen sooner or later. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2210.68s)]
*  You know, and we did. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2216.68s)]
*  It was like a big F you to everybody because people like, no, you got to go to the mainland. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2217.68s)]
*  You got to train this big guy. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2220.68s)]
*  You got to you got to fly people in the train and blah, blah, blah, this and that. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2221.68s)]
*  And then I remember getting flown out by Jeremy Stevens. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2225.68s)]
*  He was getting he was getting he was fighting Anthony Pettis. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2228.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2231.68s)]
*  So this is a long time ago. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2232.68s)]
*  He flew me out and I was thinking like, oh, this is what this is like. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2233.68s)]
*  I can't wait to see you out for sparring for sparring. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2236.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2238.68s)]
*  So I lived with him for like four weeks. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2239.68s)]
*  Oh, but yeah, that's that's rough. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2240.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2242.68s)]
*  So I was like, I was like, yeah, let's do it. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2243.68s)]
*  So in my mind, I think like, OK, we're going to see what this gym, you know, I mean, like what these mainland guys talking about. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2244.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2250.68s)]
*  And I'm like, brother, this is just like any fucking gym in Hawaii, bro. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2251.68s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2254.68s)]
*  Like we all training. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2255.68s)]
*  Everybody. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2256.68s)]
*  And were you fucking everybody up? [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2257.68s)]
*  I was doing all right. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2258.68s)]
*  I was holding my own. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2259.68s)]
*  There was like there was like I was getting taken down a bunch. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2260.68s)]
*  There was this like I had no wrestling at the time. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2262.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2264.68s)]
*  So everybody was like, if I had my way in the feet, I started getting taken down and I just like wrote like hold down or rolled up on the ground. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2265.68s)]
*  But I was thinking like I was waiting for this whole different idea of mainland training, you know, like so much people is instilling this in me. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2271.68s)]
*  You got to go do this. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2278.68s)]
*  You do that. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2279.68s)]
*  I feel like I feel like they do that a lot of times. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2280.68s)]
*  And it's not just in Hawaii, but it's also like if you're from a place that's close to a big city. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2282.68s)]
*  So like if you grow up in like Philly, for example, they'll be like, oh, well, you want to go be in finance. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2287.68s)]
*  You got to go to New York. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2293.68s)]
*  And I feel like they do this why all the time. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2294.68s)]
*  It's like, oh, well, if you really want to go make some of yourself, you got to go to the mainland. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2296.68s)]
*  So I wonder if there is a little ego about that. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2299.68s)]
*  Like, no, I could be the greatest in the world and not fucking leave here. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2301.68s)]
*  Oh, was the ego. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2305.68s)]
*  Yeah, 100 percent, bro. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2306.68s)]
*  I mean, being from why I too is the biggest egotistical guys ever. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2308.68s)]
*  Wait, really? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2312.68s)]
*  Yeah, bro. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2313.68s)]
*  Everybody's just testosterone, bro. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2314.68s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2315.68s)]
*  I wanted to make sure I could fight, bro. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2316.68s)]
*  That's that. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2318.68s)]
*  That's say something, you know, so at the end of the day, I just wanted to prove people wrong. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2319.68s)]
*  But without feeling bad for myself, I was talking to someone off screen and I was the same. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2323.68s)]
*  Like, that's just how it is. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2328.68s)]
*  Like, I thought so. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2329.68s)]
*  You victimized. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2331.68s)]
*  I victimized myself a lot. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2332.68s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2333.68s)]
*  For? [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2334.68s)]
*  Just just being like I thought I was owed something in this world. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2335.68s)]
*  Like, I just thought I was owed, owed something in this world. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2337.68s)]
*  And being from why not, I felt like you guys got to give me a little more attention because I'm from there. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2340.68s)]
*  And then when I actually went to the real world and realized that like, oh, shit, I ain't own anything. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2344.68s)]
*  If you want anything in this life, you go work hard for it. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2349.68s)]
*  So that's why I was trying to try to tell the kids that's coming up right now. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2352.68s)]
*  And why not? [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2356.68s)]
*  Right now, we're actually working with the USC. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2357.68s)]
*  Hopefully, we can do something with the Boys and Girls Club. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2359.68s)]
*  We're opening where we're trying to open a little gym facility so somebody can train and stuff and just let people know, you know, like I'm from here. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2361.68s)]
*  I remember going back to the intermediate for career day. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2370.68s)]
*  And I remember going back to when I talked there, they put me in my old science class and my science teacher stood there, Mr. Smodas. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2374.68s)]
*  I was a I was an idiot. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2381.68s)]
*  I was a I was a hot kid. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2383.68s)]
*  I was I always got into trouble. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2385.68s)]
*  I was I was my frickin best. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2387.68s)]
*  My favorite chair in the whole seat was next to the vice principal. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2389.68s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2392.68s)]
*  That's what it was. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2393.68s)]
*  And I told the kids like, look, it's not how you start. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2394.68s)]
*  So you finish if I can do this. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2396.68s)]
*  Why not you guys? [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2398.68s)]
*  I mean, I just I believed in myself and I did it. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2399.68s)]
*  You know, I changed my ninth grade is where it really, really mattered. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2401.68s)]
*  You know, I remember I went to my grandma. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2405.68s)]
*  I told her I want to play baseball. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2408.68s)]
*  And like I wanted to play baseball. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2410.68s)]
*  Like I was my thing. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2411.68s)]
*  She's like, oh, yeah, I can play baseball. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2412.68s)]
*  We have no money to send you to college. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2414.68s)]
*  So you need a you need a scholarship. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2416.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2418.68s)]
*  And then I was like, OK. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2419.68s)]

*  I mean, you know, get out of here. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2422.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's not it's not a great thing to say because like I think I just had a lot of help, bro. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2424.68s)]
*  Yeah. And I figured out if you sat next to the smartest guy in class, you kept asking them questions. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2428.68s)]
*  They get frustrated to the point where they grab your paper. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2434.68s)]
*  Thank you, my friend. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2437.68s)]

*  And then I didn't even I had great teachers, like my ninth grade teacher, like I had a hard time in math. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2446.68s)]
*  And Mr. Gray, he had like we had we had this recess where it was like 15 minutes and then a 40 and then a 30 minute lunch. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2451.68s)]
*  Like the 15 minutes or 30 minute lunch, you always come back. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2458.68s)]

*  And that's why there's been no mention of them just yet in the episode. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2476.68s)]

*  Peace. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2516.68s)]
*  I'm curious. Do you remember the first time you went to the mainland? [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2517.68s)]
*  First time? [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2519.68s)]
*  Yeah. How old were you? [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2520.68s)]
*  Bro, the first time I went to mainland was in Iowa. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2522.68s)]
*  I was 18. I just graduated school. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2528.68s)]
*  We went to this town called Crescent, Iowa, bro. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2530.68s)]
*  I went out there because the opportunity was like these guys were telling us my trainer at the time, my old trainer was like they were saying like, oh, look, you could we're going to open up this gym. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2533.68s)]
*  You guys run it, whatever. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2543.68s)]

*  What is up with that first DC? [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2570.68s)]
*  I know how to pick them, bro. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2572.68s)]

*  So I'm not even friends with the guy anymore because we had a falling out. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2578.68s)]
*  But he ended up naming with him. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2581.68s)]
*  But I ended up staying out there for four months and was for training and stuff. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2583.68s)]
*  So I was I was 17 over there. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2588.68s)]
*  We knew the guys who was running the MMA stuff. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2591.68s)]
*  So I could lie. I was 18. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2593.68s)]
*  I had my first MMA fights out there and was doing like September, October, November, December. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2595.68s)]
*  So during September and the guy I was staying with was his friend, you know, and the house we staying at. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2600.68s)]

*  Is that a strip? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2616.68s)]

*  Ice skating rink, right? [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2618.68s)]
*  I had to fucking dress like I was going to the fucking ice skating rink every night because I'm from Hawaii and I'm freezing. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2620.68s)]
*  We don't have a fucking heater in the house. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2626.68s)]
*  And I'm like, what the hell is going on? [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2628.68s)]
*  You know, like, I remember just thinking like, oh, shit, this is crazy. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2630.68s)]

*  And then when October came, the gym was going to happen in November. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2638.68s)]
*  And it kept getting put. It wasn't going to happen. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2641.68s)]
*  And then December, they asked me, oh, you want to go back home? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2643.68s)]
*  You want to go back home and see your family? [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2645.68s)]
*  I was like, bro, if you send me back home. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2647.68s)]
*  I'm not coming back. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2649.68s)]
*  I was like, if you send me back home, I'm going to return flight. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2650.68s)]
*  I'm not coming back. He's like, no, no worries. No worries. I'll fly you guys up with this. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2652.68s)]
*  I was like, brother, I see his name is his name is Will or friends name. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2655.68s)]
*  I was like, brother, Will, I don't know when I see you, but I'm probably going to see you in Hawaii because I ain't never come back to Iowa. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2658.68s)]
*  And I'm coming back. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2664.68s)]
*  Was it really culturally different like while you were there? Did it feel similar? [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2666.68s)]
*  Brother, it's different. It's all there. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2668.68s)]
*  I remember October. We driving during Halloween. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2670.68s)]
*  And after Halloween, I was driving down the road and I see fucking house TP'd and everything. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2674.68s)]
*  I was like, holy shit. I thought this only happened on Disney Channel. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2678.68s)]
*  I thought this was fake. I thought this only happened in the movie. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2681.68s)]
*  Who the fuck really fucking TP's a whole fucking house, bro? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2684.68s)]
*  My friend's house got like, his parents house got like TP'd the shit out of, bro. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2687.68s)]
*  Eggs. I was like, and then kids like, it was like a Disney Channel, bro. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2692.68s)]
*  Like kids like arguing about stuff and like meeting up. I was just out of high school, right? [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2696.68s)]
*  And you see these kids, these high school kids like meeting up, arguing because I made friends with some high schoolers, you know, like guys who's graduated like 12th grade. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2700.68s)]
*  And like I was like, what the hell is this? This is like Disney Channel. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2706.68s)]
*  Like I'm in a Disney Channel movie. I was like, this is crazy. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2710.68s)]
*  How much is America that we'll just TP your house? [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2712.68s)]
*  Like a lot of countries don't have toilet paper at all. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2715.68s)]
*  They were like, let's just throw that shit in the tree. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2717.68s)]
*  Egging a house. We're going to waste food to ruin someone's paint. Like it's crazy. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2719.68s)]
*  Crazy, bro. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2723.68s)]
*  Did you ever get in on it though? [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2724.68s)]
*  No, I never did. I never did. I never. Yeah. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2725.68s)]
*  Like I didn't think of wasting food or wasting toilet paper. You know what I mean? [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2728.68s)]
*  I was like, bro, toilet paper is meant to wipe my butt. What the hell is that? [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2731.68s)]
*  And then I was just thinking, I was like, I was putting myself in there and I was like, you know how hard is that for cleaning that shit? [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2734.68s)]
*  Holy bro, like the tree is hot. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2740.68s)]
*  So at first I'm thinking like, you know how much you got to clean? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2743.68s)]
*  And then I'm thinking like, whose arm is throwing that up? [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2746.68s)]
*  Get him in the league, baby. Let's go. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2749.68s)]
*  Bro, what the hell? Yeah, so it's crazy, bro. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2751.68s)]
*  What about the Midwest girls? Is that the first time you ever hooked up with a girl from the west? [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2754.68s)]
*  The fat white? [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2759.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2760.68s)]
*  Brother, I mean, they wasn't my taste. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2761.68s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's right, dude. You probably don't know about thick white women because we got that too. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2762.68s)]
*  Yeah, I was like, that was in my taste. I was just so used to Hawaiian girls. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2766.68s)]
*  So like when I saw that, I was like, what is this? [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2770.68s)]
*  Those are the real pogs you got to fight over. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2774.68s)]
*  I was up there just trying to work and train and I just wanted to fight, bro. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2781.68s)]
*  What was the job? [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2785.68s)]
*  We were just going to be trainers, bro. I was going to run a kickboxing club. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2786.68s)]
*  The gym that never opened. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2791.68s)]
*  Yeah, that never ever happened to today, bro. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2792.68s)]
*  Okay, so I know that there's no such thing as Filipino gambling rings and wine eye, but if I know that they don't... [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2795.68s)]
*  I know that this is obviously a figment of my imagination and nobody knows about it. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2804.68s)]
*  Yeah, but it's a fake world. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2808.68s)]
*  It's a fake world, right? And I know that there's no cock fights there still to this day. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2809.68s)]
*  No, nothing. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2812.68s)]
*  That was so back in the day, bro. I don't know what you're talking about. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2815.68s)]
*  Only human cock fights. Not chicken. Why would you try to kill a chicken? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2817.68s)]
*  We have a fight club, bro. Come on. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2821.68s)]
*  But was that a thing way back in the day? Was that part of it growing up? [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2823.68s)]
*  This is hard hitting journalism, bro. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2834.68s)]
*  It is, bro. It is. But it's crazy, bro. It's crazy, bro. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2836.68s)]
*  I always didn't want to get involved in it because the story that you hear that happens at that thing, I'm like, fuck this. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2839.68s)]
*  Bro, the crazy stuff happened, bro. You're in a fucking illegal ring. What do you think is going to happen? [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2846.68s)]
*  Oh, okay. So it's illegal shit. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2851.68s)]
*  Yeah. So I'm like, bro, I'm good. I ain't trying to get busted. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2852.68s)]
*  Fair enough. Fair enough. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2856.68s)]
*  Keep me out of this shit. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2857.68s)]
*  Fair enough. One of the things that when we were in Hawaii last time that I love that I've used since is when you're at the late night spot after they've stopped serving alcohol, you ask for cold soup at the Korean spot. Have you ever used that? [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2858.68s)]
*  I have never ever used that. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2873.68s)]
*  That's beer. You ask for cold soup even when they stop serving. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2874.68s)]
*  Oh, for real? [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2876.68s)]
*  You've never used that one? [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2877.68s)]
*  No, I never did. I'm not out there. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2878.68s)]
*  Bro, I thought that this was like everybody. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2879.68s)]
*  No, no. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2881.68s)]
*  I thought this was some Hawaiian shit. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2882.68s)]
*  No, after the lights come on and everybody start looking wild as shit, I'm going home. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2883.68s)]
*  That's good. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2888.68s)]
*  I am going because like, bro, when you see your friend after what, three o'clock, four o'clock, they close, anything after that, anything after 12 is crazy. So when you're at four to a spot, it's like, brother, we need to go back to the hotel room because we're going to end up on someone's IG or something. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2889.68s)]
*  You don't know somebody dancing in the background. What the fuck is that? [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2904.68s)]
*  Do you ever worry about that? You ever worry about getting caught up in, I don't know, how do I say it, people trying to get clout off of you back home. Like people trying to videotape you at the supermarket. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2907.68s)]
*  Bro, I mean, it comes with a job but then like there are certain times where, come on, you don't do this. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2921.68s)]
*  Like you're with your kid and. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2925.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, you don't do this. The worst is like, to me, I mean, I'm sure it happens to you guys all the time. It's like you're eating dinner. I'm sorry to interrupt you but can we take a picture? I know you're at dinner. I was like, no, you're not sorry. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2926.68s)]
*  You're not sorry. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2939.68s)]
*  You're right here. You're thinking of it. Maybe you're a spirit or something and sorry but you're not sorry. It's funny but it comes with a job. I mean, that's the price you pay. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2941.68s)]
*  You must get approached all the time because you're a local celebrity in your town. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2953.68s)]
*  Or they're used to them. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2957.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. In my town it's fine but then when we go out towards the town and people are flying in and they see us then that's when it's like, ah, come on. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2958.68s)]
*  I'm trying to think there's a more famous Hawaiian alive right now. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2966.68s)]
*  That still lives out there? [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2972.68s)]
*  No, that's just like. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2973.68s)]
*  Over the rainbow guy is he still alive? [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2974.68s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2976.68s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2977.68s)]
*  Ian Tongue. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2978.68s)]
*  Bro, do you know him? Do you know him? [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2979.68s)]
*  I don't know him. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2980.68s)]
*  That was incredible. I got like emotional. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2981.68s)]
*  Bro, he's. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2983.68s)]
*  I'm fucking crying watching. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2984.68s)]
*  When he said that. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2985.68s)]
*  The American Idol dude, the kid who just won. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2986.68s)]
*  Yeah, the kid. But he is like the reincarnation of brother years, bro. The way he can. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2987.68s)]
*  I haven't heard of this. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2991.68s)]
*  The way he can. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2992.68s)]
*  Oh my. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2993.68s)]
*  It's a big incident. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2994.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2995.68s)]
*  He was on American Idol. He won. He was a big Hawaiian dude and he was playing like this [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2996.68s)]
*  parlor guitar and he sang. What was the song? Ah, fuck. What was the guy's name? God, what's [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=2999.68s)]
*  the fucking song? [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3005.68s)]
*  The most recent one? [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3006.68s)]
*  The Ian Sing. Yeah. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3007.68s)]
*  Yeah, the one with James Blunt? [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3008.68s)]
*  James Blunt. The James Blunt song. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3009.68s)]
*  The Monsters? I think it's called Monsters, yeah. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3010.68s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3011.68s)]
*  Yeah, when he's saying that with his dad, before his dad, it's crazy. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3012.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3013.68s)]
*  But I think he's the reincarnation. I mean, I hate when people compare me to another fighter [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3014.68s)]
*  or whatever, but I mean, like Ian, the way when I listen to him, I didn't hear no one [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3024.68s)]
*  move me the way he does, just like how brother is did. Like, brother is like somewhere over [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3032.68s)]
*  the rainbow is just amazing and I think so Ian is going to come out with a song that [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3037.68s)]
*  is like going to be on that level, I believe, because the way he sings is just, I mean, [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3041.68s)]
*  there's not one song that he did not sing that people didn't cry. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3045.68s)]
*  Bro, it's unbelievable. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3048.68s)]
*  It's crazy, he had people crying the whole season. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3049.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3051.68s)]
*  The guy's voice is just, it's special, man, it's special. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3052.68s)]
*  Every one of the judges, I can't believe you didn't see it. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3056.68s)]
*  I need to see this, I haven't seen it. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3058.68s)]
*  Bro, it is. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3059.68s)]
*  You're going to love it, bro. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3060.68s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3061.68s)]
*  And then he did that to get on the show and then he actually did it with James Blunt. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3062.68s)]
*  Oh, I saw the duet. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3068.68s)]
*  So he did the live bit with James Blunt and when he sang that song, it was even more crazy [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3069.68s)]
*  because like James Blunt put his hand on him to help him because he couldn't sing it. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3073.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3076.68s)]
*  And then James Blunt like touched him and he ended up pulling through to sing it, which [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3077.68s)]
*  is just crazy. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3080.68s)]
*  So you still feel a lot of pride seeing Hawaiians make it in anything. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3081.68s)]
*  Oh, for sure, with everything, you know. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3083.68s)]
*  You might have to play this now, just cry with the boys or something. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3085.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3088.68s)]
*  So we're going to have to watch it, bro. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3089.68s)]
*  Cry with the boys, bro? [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3091.68s)]
*  It's good, dude. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3092.68s)]
*  Because yeah, I've never heard this guy. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3093.68s)]
*  Iam Tongi is his name. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3095.68s)]
*  Iam Tongi. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3097.68s)]
*  Where is he from? [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3098.68s)]
*  He is from Oahu on the opposite side of the island of me. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3099.68s)]
*  So like I'm in Waianae, he's on the north shore, Kahuku side. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3103.68s)]
*  So there's a mountain that separates us pretty much. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3106.68s)]
*  You said there's a lot of white people coming to the area. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3108.68s)]
*  I thought Hawaii has this rule where it's like only Hawaiians can buy. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3112.68s)]
*  So we do have a Hawaiian. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3117.68s)]
*  We do have a, like you said, like a- [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3119.68s)]
*  What is that rule? [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3121.68s)]
*  Because I- [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3122.68s)]
*  It's a, you got to be a certain amount of Hawaiian to buy on the Hawaiian land or whatever, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3123.68s)]
*  but it's like- [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3126.68s)]
*  People find a way, bro. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3127.68s)]
*  It's bullshit, bro. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3128.68s)]
*  How are people getting around it? [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3129.68s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3131.68s)]
*  It's like you're leasing the land for a hundred years. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3132.68s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3137.68s)]
*  So the Hawaiian thing is like you're just leasing that land for a hundred years, [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3138.68s)]
*  and then you got to give it to somebody else that meet the qualifications of like you'll be certain part of Hawaiian, [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3142.68s)]
*  and then you get it for a hundred more years again. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3149.68s)]
*  But that's just all it is. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3152.68s)]
*  It's like it's not even yours because they can just come in and just be like, [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3153.68s)]
*  well, we feel like taking it. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3156.68s)]
*  Yeah, but how are white people buying land? [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3158.68s)]
*  Money, money, man. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3161.68s)]
*  Money freaking talks, I think. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3163.68s)]
*  There's that guy, Larry Ellison, who bought the whole island of Lanai. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3165.68s)]
*  Yeah, almost. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3169.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3170.68s)]
*  Almost, bro. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3171.68s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3172.68s)]
*  And there was a whole thing with the telescope too. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3173.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3174.68s)]
*  With Protect TMT, they're just trying to put bigger telescopes on top of it and stuff, [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3176.68s)]
*  but it's crazy, man. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3181.68s)]
*  It's a wild time we're living. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3183.68s)]
*  But yeah, this is EM. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3184.68s)]
*  This is his audition. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3186.68s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3187.68s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3188.68s)]
*  I need to suck it, guys. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3189.68s)]
*  Wow. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3190.68s)]
*  He's amazing, bro. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3191.68s)]

*  He's amazing, bro. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3197.68s)]
*  He's special, bro. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3198.68s)]
*  He's special. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3199.68s)]
*  I've been like, it was crazy when he was doing it. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3200.68s)]
*  He did his tour and stuff, and he's such a young kid, right? [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3204.68s)]
*  And then when he came back, he did the finale stuff, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3208.68s)]
*  and I was like, I'm going to go to the finale. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3212.68s)]
*  And I was just like, man, this kid's special, man. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3214.68s)]
*  I hope he's around the right people around him to let them know what is wrong, what is right, [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3217.68s)]
*  and he just stay on that path, because he's going to be somebody special. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3223.68s)]
*  He's big. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3227.68s)]
*  He's going to be big, bro. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3228.68s)]
*  Have you met him in person? [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3229.68s)]
*  I didn't meet him, no. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3230.68s)]
*  The day they had that concert for him, I flew in later in that night from Japan, [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3231.68s)]
*  so I was like, oh, man, I missed him. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3238.68s)]
*  But I'm sure we're going to cross paths. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3240.68s)]
*  Whenever we cross paths, it happens. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3242.68s)]
*  I'm not going to force nothing, but I just want to meet him genuinely, man. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3243.68s)]
*  That guy is crazy. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3246.68s)]
*  You got to watch the one when he actually sings with James Blunt. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3248.68s)]
*  It's freaking crazy when him and James Blunt singing together. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3251.68s)]
*  It's like even more insane. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3255.68s)]

*  And I hate when people was like, oh, that doesn't look like the Cubs Swanson of late. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3570.68s)]
*  Oh, they try to take away. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3574.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3575.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3576.68s)]
*  I hate when guys, even when they say, oh, I didn't feel right, like, motherfucker, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3577.68s)]
*  I went in there. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3579.68s)]
*  We all get injuries. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3580.68s)]
*  We all have something. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3581.68s)]
*  We have personal shit going on. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3582.68s)]
*  Of course. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3583.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3584.68s)]
*  He just went out there. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3585.68s)]
*  He showed up that night. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3586.68s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3587.68s)]
*  I showed up too, but he just fucking did better. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3588.68s)]
*  I'm not going to stay away from him. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3589.68s)]
*  You know what I think I do? [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3590.68s)]
*  We freaking, we figured it out. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3591.68s)]
*  I'll get back to there, and if we can fight again, we fight again. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3592.68s)]
*  It was interesting, your trilogy, because I feel like each of you made adjustments. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3596.68s)]
*  Fight one to fight two, you made big adjustments. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3601.68s)]
*  Like, first two rounds, easy. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3604.68s)]
*  You're walking around, it was good. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3606.68s)]
*  I actually had you winning the second fight. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3607.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3609.68s)]
*  I know that was a really close fight. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3610.68s)]
*  But I had you, I had you winning the second fight because you made those adjustments. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3611.68s)]
*  Then three, it feels like he made those adjustments. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3615.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3617.68s)]
*  And I feel like it's ping pong with you guys. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3618.68s)]
*  I feel like next. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3620.68s)]
*  Best in the world, bro. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3621.68s)]
*  When you're the best in the world, the only thing that separates you is what I tell people, [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3622.68s)]
*  everything. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3625.68s)]
*  The only thing that separates me from somebody who's not in the UFC is just I know how to [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3626.68s)]
*  put things together a little bit, or I know how to mentally play that mental game. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3629.68s)]
*  And that's why I tell everybody, all the uppercummers, they're like, oh, what is your secret, blah, [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3633.68s)]
*  blah. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3637.68s)]
*  I ain't got no secret. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3638.68s)]
*  So everybody in the UFC know how to throw one, two, know how to block a one, two. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3639.68s)]
*  Except for Ortega at the time. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3643.68s)]
*  All jokes, all jokes. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3645.68s)]
*  I just keep telling people, like, bro, everybody know how to do everything. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3648.68s)]
*  It's just who's going to apply their game plan first and be constant on it. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3653.68s)]
*  And that's why I said, I'm no different than anybody. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3659.68s)]
*  The only difference between the top 15 fighters in the rest of the UFC is they know how to [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3662.68s)]
*  put it together. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3666.68s)]
*  It's a mind thing. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3667.68s)]
*  And then you go up to the 10, mind thing, five, mind thing. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3668.68s)]
*  And the champion, is this a mind thing? [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3671.68s)]
*  You cannot say anybody's like, we all know how to fight. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3673.68s)]
*  Then it is just who's putting together. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3676.68s)]
*  Mind thing, by that you mean game plan? [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3678.68s)]
*  You mean preparation, how to take that person out? [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3680.68s)]
*  Game plan, preparation, and just showing up. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3682.68s)]
*  Most of the time, half of these guys beat themselves before they even step in and knock [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3684.68s)]
*  out someone. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3688.68s)]
*  How so? [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3689.68s)]
*  They just beat themselves. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3690.68s)]
*  The moment gets to them. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3691.68s)]
*  The moment gets to them. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3693.68s)]
*  When I fought. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3695.68s)]
*  You can tell they're nervous. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3696.68s)]
*  Or something's going on. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3697.68s)]
*  I remember when I fought Dustin Poirier, my first fight, my UFC event, my first ever UFC [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3699.68s)]
*  event. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3704.68s)]
*  We was the headline at the time was the FX card. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3705.68s)]
*  So right before the pay-per-view, we go there early. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3707.68s)]
*  I see people, Steven Thompson was the second fighter of the night, or third fight. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3711.68s)]
*  I forget what fight it was, but it was so empty. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3715.68s)]
*  I remember watching his fight. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3717.68s)]
*  I was like, oh yeah, they showed a crowd. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3718.68s)]
*  It's empty. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3720.68s)]
*  I was like, holy shit, this is like fighting in Hawaii. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3721.68s)]
*  There's nothing. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3722.68s)]
*  I remember I had a famous boxer, a famous Hawaiian boxer in my corner. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3724.68s)]
*  His name was Jesus Salute. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3728.68s)]
*  Okay. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3729.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3730.68s)]
*  The Hawaiian punch, they used to call him. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3731.68s)]
*  But the original. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3732.68s)]
*  There's another Hawaiian. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3733.68s)]
*  Brian Deloitte. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3734.68s)]
*  Yeah, he was the original Hawaiian punch. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3735.68s)]
*  So Brian got the name. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3736.68s)]
*  So Brian got it after him. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3737.68s)]
*  Yeah, after Jesus Salute. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3738.68s)]
*  So go look him up. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3739.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3740.68s)]
*  So Jesus Salute was a man, and he was like, he'd been there. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3741.68s)]
*  So he was like telling me, Max, when this lights go on, stay calm, stay calm, stay calm. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3742.68s)]
*  And I was thinking, God, I got this. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3747.68s)]
*  No worry, no worry. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3749.68s)]
*  Fucking lights went on. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3750.68s)]
*  I was like 200 miles per hour, bro. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3751.68s)]
*  This is right before the main card. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3753.68s)]
*  So every seat was filled in Mandalay Bay. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3755.68s)]
*  I remember being in there and just thinking when Bruce was introducing me, saying my name, [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3758.68s)]
*  like my name is weak. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3766.68s)]
*  I was like, holy fuck. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3767.68s)]
*  I was like, bro, you can't be faked in, Max. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3768.68s)]
*  You're on fucking TV. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3769.68s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3770.68s)]
*  I was like, what the hell? [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3771.68s)]
*  So a moment got to me. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3772.68s)]
*  I had a little bit. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3773.68s)]
*  And then I remember fight week two, I saw George St. Pierre. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3774.68s)]
*  I saw Anderson Silva. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3777.68s)]
*  I saw Jose Aldo, Frankie. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3778.68s)]
*  Like who's who? [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3780.68s)]
*  Like all these guys that I wanted to. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3781.68s)]
*  And I remember being in the back after I lost. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3783.68s)]
*  I looked good on the feet. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3786.68s)]
*  I got to the end. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3788.68s)]
*  He like triangle arm barred me from the top, which is crazy. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3789.68s)]
*  He triangle arm barred me from the top. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3792.68s)]
*  So yeah, I was like, what the hell? [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3794.68s)]
*  And I remember sitting in the back and thinking to myself like, fuck this. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3796.68s)]
*  I was like, why are you acting like this? [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3800.68s)]
*  Why are you acting so starstruck around these guys? [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3802.68s)]
*  Like you're a UFC fighter. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3804.68s)]
*  You belong here. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3806.68s)]
*  Fucking act like it. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3807.68s)]
*  I don't really ask too much people for pictures or whatever. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3808.68s)]
*  Because in my mind, I can do that when I'm done. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3811.68s)]
*  When I can take it in. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3814.68s)]
*  But right now it's a game time. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3816.68s)]
*  Even the scene with all the titles. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3818.68s)]
*  Everybody's like, oh, why don't you have your titles put around the house and blah, blah, this and that. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3820.68s)]
*  I was like, I stood fighting, that's why. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3824.68s)]
*  And they don't understand it. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3826.68s)]
*  I was like, what do you mean? [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3827.68s)]
*  I was like, I'm stood fighting. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3828.68s)]
*  Don't focus on what you did. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3829.68s)]
*  What do you want to do? [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3831.68s)]
*  I still want to do this. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3832.68s)]
*  I'll bring out all the belts and stuff when I retire and I can celebrate them. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3833.68s)]
*  Right now there's no celebration. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3837.68s)]
*  It's a freaking grind all the way through. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3839.68s)]
*  Do you have a specific pre-fight ritual now to keep you in the moment? [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3841.68s)]
*  Bro, the pre-fight ritual, not really. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3845.68s)]
*  I'm just sitting in the back. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3848.68s)]
*  And I mean, I get nervous, bro. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3849.68s)]
*  If somebody tells you, I mean, I'm sure. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3851.68s)]
*  Do you get nervous before going on stage when you're doing a show or something? [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3853.68s)]
*  It depends. But I think the bigger the event, the more anxiety can present itself. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3856.68s)]
*  For sure. You know what I mean? [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3859.68s)]
*  And that's how you're supposed to feel. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3860.68s)]
*  I think. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3861.68s)]
*  If you don't feel anything, you don't care. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3862.68s)]
*  You're not human, bro. You're not human. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3864.68s)]
*  And you never do the work. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3865.68s)]
*  I was like, bro, if you don't feel nothing, I tell them, bro, you didn't do enough work. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3866.68s)]
*  You didn't know. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3870.68s)]
*  I sacrifice so much. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3871.68s)]
*  That's why I get nervous because I'm like, fuck, what if I let people down? [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3872.68s)]
*  My mind is like, what if I let these guys down? [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3874.68s)]
*  Like I missed my son's birthday. I missed my wife's birthday. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3876.68s)]
*  Yeah, this can't be for nothing. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3879.68s)]
*  Yeah, this can't be nothing. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3880.68s)]
*  I got to go out there and fucking give it my all. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3881.68s)]
*  And then if I do end up on the bad side, at least I can look at myself and look at my love one at a time. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3883.68s)]
*  Look, I gave it my all. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3887.68s)]
*  That guy was just better than me on that night. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3888.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3891.68s)]
*  So for sure, you know, I get nervous. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3892.68s)]
*  I remember this is the thing that I always do. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3895.68s)]
*  Like I'm in the back. I'm just in my mind. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3898.68s)]
*  I'm in my head and I'm just thinking like, damn, hold your next, Max, let's go. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3900.68s)]
*  And I start thinking like, what the, like in my mind, I start thinking like, what the frick am I doing? [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3903.68s)]
*  Are we here again? [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3907.68s)]
*  I told myself last time I was going to be here. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3908.68s)]
*  And then I'm going like, fuck, you can just work at McDonald's or something. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3910.68s)]
*  Live an easy life. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3913.68s)]
*  And then I think like, fuck, no, you can't do that shit. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3915.68s)]
*  The life you want to live costs money. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3919.68s)]
*  Go out there and get yourself out there. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3921.68s)]
*  That's the little prep talk. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3923.68s)]
*  I kind of talk to myself. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3924.68s)]
*  I always like, I built, I knocked myself down there. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3925.68s)]
*  I built myself up. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3928.68s)]
*  This is time. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3929.68s)]
*  And then by the time we walk, I hear my song. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3930.68s)]
*  It's like, it's go time. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3931.68s)]
*  So once you hear the song and you're already walking, you're in fight mode. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3932.68s)]
*  Oh yeah, bro. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3935.68s)]
*  Once to walk out, I stay in the back of looking at my coaches, smiling, talking to them and telling them, brother, there's another one. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3936.68s)]
*  And then they would tell me, yeah, let's go time. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3941.68s)]
*  What do you feel like Bruce is calling your name now? [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3943.68s)]
*  Bro, I'm just stoked, bro. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3946.68s)]

*  You don't gotta say time. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3958.68s)]
*  What's that about? [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3959.68s)]

*  What's the song you always come out to? [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3966.68s)]
*  I walk up to, I do an ad and then I always end it with Hawaiian kickboxer. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3967.68s)]
*  There's a guy from Waianae. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3972.68s)]
*  He made the song Moki Boy. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3975.68s)]
*  His name is called Moki Boy. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3977.68s)]
*  His name is called Moki Boy. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3979.68s)]
*  And it was funny because his dad is actually my, his dad was a janitor at the elementary [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3980.68s)]

*  I'm friends with the guy who sings the song. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3991.68s)]
*  So it's great. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3994.68s)]
*  He keeps on telling me, I want to change the song, Max. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3995.68s)]
*  I want to change the song. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3997.68s)]
*  I want to make it a little bit more poppy or more hip hoppy. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=3998.68s)]
*  I was like, no, I'm not going to walk up to it. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4001.68s)]
*  I was like, please do not change this song. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4003.68s)]
*  It's worked out so far. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4005.68s)]
*  This is the song I want. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4006.68s)]
*  Did you find the Apex when it was empty? [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4008.68s)]
*  No, I never fought. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4010.68s)]
*  I fought in the, I fought a year in the Apex when, when, but they had some crowd, but when [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4012.68s)]
*  we had the crowd and these motherfuckers sell those tickets, the most expensive wasn't even [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4017.68s)]
*  a belt fight and they made those tickets expensive. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4021.68s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4024.68s)]
*  How much does the setting change it for you? [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4025.68s)]
*  Like fighting in Singapore versus the States? [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4026.68s)]
*  I don't care, bro. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4028.68s)]
*  I just, I'm here to fight. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4029.68s)]

*  Like even like everybody's like, oh, it's going to be weird fighting in front of that. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4031.68s)]
*  I was like, not really. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4034.68s)]
*  It's only me and him trying to hit it, you know, kill each other. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4035.68s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4039.68s)]

*  So it's like, as long as it, as long as Dana signed the checks or whoever it is signed [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4041.68s)]
*  the check, it's a lot of zeros at the end. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4045.68s)]

*  It's the HTA. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4066.68s)]
*  And they just refuse to allow it. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4067.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4069.68s)]

*  Brother, brother. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4073.68s)]
*  They say already fight locally for free. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4074.68s)]
*  What's the problem? [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4077.68s)]
*  The HTA, we have, we have two, we have two sports there. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4078.68s)]
*  We only have two professional sports in Hawaii, bro. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4083.68s)]
*  And that's fighting and that's surfing, bro. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4085.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4088.68s)]
*  And the two most problems they give the sports, the two biggest sports they give up to is [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4089.68s)]
*  fighting and surfing. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4092.68s)]
*  And they have, we have a freaking Olympian, Carissa Moore. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4093.68s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4096.68s)]
*  Like she's Olympian or gold medalist Olympian in surfing and multiple world champion. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4097.68s)]
*  We have a John John Florence, multiple world champion surfing and did this give them hard [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4102.68s)]
*  time? [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4107.68s)]
*  I remember during the pandemic is like, really? [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4108.68s)]
*  Like you told people they could go to the beach and surf, but they wouldn't give them [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4109.68s)]
*  the permits for let them surf during the tour. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4112.68s)]
*  I was like, bro, this makes no sense. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4115.68s)]
*  They're not allowed to be in the water unless it's for an event. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4117.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4119.68s)]
*  And then, and then, and then even with fighting, it's like, oh, I think so. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4120.68s)]
*  When we was trying to, when we, we actually reached out to the PR team or whatever and [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4124.68s)]
*  their PR team reached out. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4129.68s)]
*  Like this is a couple of years ago. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4130.68s)]
*  They said like, we don't want to attract that kind of fan base here. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4132.68s)]
*  And I was like, I was like, wait, I was like, what fan base? [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4135.68s)]
*  You guys throw the Pro Bowl. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4139.68s)]
*  They paid my understanding. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4141.68s)]
*  UFC was just asking what the Pro Bowl asked for, right? [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4143.68s)]
*  Like the money that they said. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4146.68s)]
*  And I was like, bro, that's easy. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4148.68s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4149.68s)]
*  But you guys throw the Pro Bowl, the actual Pro Bowlers, the guys who the NFL guys who's [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4150.68s)]
*  actually playing in the Pro Bowl go out to the clubs and fight. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4156.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4160.68s)]
*  They fight in the club. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4161.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4162.68s)]
*  I'm like, brother, you're not going to have a fighter fighting in the club down here. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4163.68s)]
*  Fighters is like, we're crazy, but we're not going to fight. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4167.68s)]
*  We understand this. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4170.68s)]
*  But like a Pro Bowler is going and like, that's the crowd you want to go. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4171.68s)]
*  Like the actual guy. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4173.68s)]
*  I can understand. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4174.68s)]
*  You can say like, oh yeah, fans might fight this and that, especially certain. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4175.68s)]
*  But like that's anything fans fight at the Pro Bowl. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4179.68s)]
*  Also, it's going to be mainly local fans. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4181.68s)]
*  I don't think people that many people are going to fly to the Y.E.4F. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4183.68s)]
*  The fan base is there. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4186.68s)]
*  There's plenty of fights on the mainland. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4187.68s)]
*  This is some, is this some local shit where like someone needs to get greased? [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4188.68s)]

*  No, it's the rail. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4196.68s)]
*  Oh my God, bro. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4197.68s)]
*  The rail is like getting rigged. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4198.68s)]
*  They're, they're, they're getting audited right now. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4200.68s)]

*  They're building a rail, bro, in Hawaii. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4205.68s)]
*  How crazy is that? [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4206.68s)]
*  To connect what to what? [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4207.68s)]
*  Who knows? [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4208.68s)]
*  I don't even know. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4209.68s)]

*  like auditing it because like. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4218.68s)]
*  Because everybody's just taking money. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4219.68s)]
*  They're going to find out, bro. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4220.68s)]
*  Everybody's going to. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4221.68s)]
*  They're going to figure it out. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4222.68s)]
*  So. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4223.68s)]
*  That's what. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4224.68s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4225.68s)]
*  But that's, that's the thing that happens when it gets, you know, in tricky situations [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4226.68s)]
*  like this, you have a few people that have a lot of power. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4228.68s)]
*  And if they're not getting. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4230.68s)]

*  It's a little separate. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4232.68s)]
*  It might not be checked as much. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4233.68s)]
*  So they can just kind of pull money off. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4234.68s)]
*  They're going to get checked now. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4235.68s)]

*  What could it be? [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4251.68s)]
*  Is it for traffic? [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4252.68s)]
*  Cause there is traffic problems, bro. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4253.68s)]

*  I don't, I have no idea what they're just doing it for fricking to do it for fun, I think. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4255.68s)]

*  You need permission. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4316.68s)]

*  then the boat can't even dock. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4331.12s)]
*  You got to jump off to swim into it. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4332.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4334.68s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4337.68s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4339.68s)]
*  You can't swim? [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4340.68s)]
*  That's how they keep black people off the island. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4341.68s)]
*  Sorry, Barack. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4342.68s)]
*  Isn't that the thing? [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4343.68s)]
*  Sorry, Barack. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4344.68s)]

*  That he would send me his one and only boy so that everybody that trusts me no get cut [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4492.72s)]
*  off from God, but get the real kind life that stayed to the kind, to the max forever. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4499.0s)]

*  Right, you're risking someone's life. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4620.4s)]
*  People would die. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4623.16s)]
*  No, and that's what they did. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4624.16s)]
*  On YouTube you type in pipeline beefs. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4625.92s)]
*  I'm sure you just see people getting rolled up. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4628.92s)]
*  But right now it's even a weird time for guys out there. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4631.92s)]
*  Everybody's just trying to, I guess, cloud chase and get that one wave and get the wave [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4637.92s)]
*  of the winter or whatever it's called. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4643.0s)]
*  So they're out there, cameras doing whatever it is, and it's just like, bro, this is people's [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4645.68s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4650.8s)]
*  People out there die. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4651.8s)]
*  They actually die. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4652.8s)]
*  They hit their face in the reef. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4653.8s)]
*  They're just being thrown because you can't get to them because they're sets after sets [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4655.4400000000005s)]
*  after sets. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4657.4400000000005s)]
*  Also, the reef down there is kind of gnarly where there are these pockets. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4658.4400000000005s)]
*  You get holes, bro, your pockets. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4661.4400000000005s)]
*  You get slammed underneath one. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4662.4400000000005s)]
*  And you just, you're underneath. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4664.52s)]
*  The current is moving because you're getting holed. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4665.52s)]
*  Dude, I almost fucking died in Lanai. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4667.52s)]
*  My leash got caught on some reef when I was surfing out there. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4669.8s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4672.52s)]

*  I literally, I couldn't get up. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4674.52s)]
*  I had no more breath left and I took a breath of fucking water. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4677.12s)]
*  Bro, why are you laughing? [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4679.92s)]
*  This is a dream. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4683.04s)]
*  This is a dream. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4684.04s)]
*  The white guy dies in fucking Lanai. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4685.04s)]
*  Bye, Holly. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4688.04s)]
*  But somehow this shit popped up. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4691.04s)]
*  But yeah, I remember even watching surf videos and stuff as a kid and seeing that, there [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4693.04s)]
*  are these pockets in the reef so you could go and you could fall into one of the pockets [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4698.4400000000005s)]
*  and then you don't know which is up and down. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4702.28s)]
*  No you don't, bro. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4705.32s)]
*  The sand is moving everywhere so you can't open your eyes and even find it. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4706.32s)]
*  Gnarly. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4709.24s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4710.24s)]
*  I know your girl is a pro surfer. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4711.5599999999995s)]
*  Is there a gender thing where the dudes will run it or is it like they'll open up for men [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4714.24s)]
*  and women? [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4718.84s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4719.84s)]
*  They got girls out there that can surf. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4720.84s)]
*  But they got to be girls in charge. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4721.84s)]
*  What's the girl? [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4723.84s)]
*  Kayla Kennelly, I think her name is? [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4724.84s)]
*  Kayla? [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4726.84s)]
*  I think it's Kaitlyn or whatever. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4727.84s)]
*  She's the old school big wave surfer. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4730.84s)]
*  I know what you're talking about. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4733.84s)]

*  I forget her name too but they call her the queen of pipe. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4737.48s)]
*  She just charges, bro. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4739.96s)]
*  You got to have some screws loose to be charging that wave, bro. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4741.68s)]
*  It's crazy, bro. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4745.4800000000005s)]
*  Has wifey ever surfed pipe? [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4746.4800000000005s)]
*  She did pipe before. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4747.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of crazy. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4749.88s)]
*  But it's all about getting ready and training and whatever for it. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4751.88s)]
*  You get scared for her? [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4755.68s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4757.68s)]
*  Because she's afraid for you but her job you could argue way more people die at. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4758.68s)]
*  As I tell people, surfers are like, oh shit, your job is crazy. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4763.28s)]
*  I was like, no it's not. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4767.28s)]
*  There's no sharks. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4769.28s)]
*  You get to control somebody. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4770.599999999999s)]
*  If you really want it, you can teach somebody how to fight in there. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4772.599999999999s)]
*  But at the end of the day, Mother Nature is going to slam you and be like, okay, wait, [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1S7nDbIUWM&t=4775.599999999999s)]
