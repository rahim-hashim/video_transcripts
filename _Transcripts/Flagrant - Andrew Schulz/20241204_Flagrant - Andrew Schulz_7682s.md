*  We're back, baby! [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=0.0s)]

*  Finally, we got a beef worth responding to. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Finally. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=8.1s)]
*  All these little peons on the internet talking shit. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=8.6s)]
*  I don't give them no love, but this guy right here. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=12.0s)]
*  What happened? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=14.6s)]
*  What do you mean, what happened? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  Have you not, you know, been listening to music lately? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=16.4s)]
*  I've heard some. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=18.8s)]
*  There's a pretty big thing going on. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=19.8s)]
*  Yeah, between Kendrick Lamar. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Laws were written. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=24.3s)]
*  Laws were written? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=25.5s)]
*  Laws were written. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=26.5s)]
*  I don't like him pretending he doesn't know what the fuck's going on. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=27.5s)]
*  With his little milk mustache. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=30.5s)]
*  He's just been pissing me off. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=32.5s)]
*  Okay? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=34.5s)]
*  Is it on there? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=35.5s)]
*  Now listen, no. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=36.0s)]
*  Guys, we gotta take this seriously. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=36.5s)]
*  Listen, rappers are telling comedians we need to be more respectful to women. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=38.5s)]
*  So we gotta really, we gotta sit back and reflect. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=41.5s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=44.5s)]
*  They're the most pious group. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=45.5s)]
*  Listen, nobody has respected women more. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=46.5s)]
*  Through art. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=50.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=51.5s)]
*  Than rappers. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=52.5s)]
*  Okay? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=53.5s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=54.5s)]
*  I completely understand how a rapper could look at a comedian telling a joke and be like, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=55.5s)]
*  yo, y'all need to switch that shit up. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=59.5s)]
*  How dare y'all keep saying your wives are annoying. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=61.5s)]
*  You know, be more like us and, you know, bitches ain't nothing but hoes and tricks. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=65.5s)]
*  I beat my bitch with a stick. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=68.5s)]
*  What? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=69.5s)]
*  You can lick on the nuts or suck the dick. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=70.5s)]
*  I beat my bitch with a stick. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=72.5s)]
*  What? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=73.5s)]
*  Did you just think of that? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=74.5s)]
*  That's a real lyric. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=75.5s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=76.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=77.5s)]
*  That's a real lyric from music that protects women. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=78.5s)]
*  And for decades, protects women. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=80.5s)]
*  And listen, listen, right now the guy on top, Kung Fu Kenny, he is the guy on top. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=83.5s)]
*  He is the guy on top. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=90.5s)]
*  He is making sure, he is making sure that comedians, he put a law in, he put a law in place. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=91.5s)]
*  All right, let's see the exact line, okay? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=96.5s)]
*  Don't let no white comedian talk about no black woman, that's law. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=98.5s)]
*  Now, technically speaking, if we're going off of Grammatic English, he is saying, I can talk about black women. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=102.5s)]
*  Don't let no white comedian talk about no black woman. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=110.5s)]
*  So he's basically saying all white comedians are only allowed to talk about black women. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=113.5s)]
*  Exclusively. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=116.5s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about, country of the land. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=117.5s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=119.5s)]
*  It's a law. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=120.5s)]
*  Finally he understands it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=121.5s)]
*  It's a law. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=122.5s)]
*  Now I understand why he's doing a comedy with the South Park creators. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=123.5s)]
*  Ah, that makes sense. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=126.5s)]
*  Because he appreciates white comedians that make fun of black people. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=127.5s)]
*  There you go. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=130.5s)]
*  And they've done that brilliantly for decades. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=131.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=133.5s)]
*  And he would never want to break one of his own laws. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=134.5s)]
*  That's true. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=136.5s)]
*  I mean, didn't they have a character called Token on the South Park show? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=137.5s)]
*  Yeah, they do. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=139.5s)]
*  Which I'm sure Kendrick is a big fan of. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=140.5s)]
*  That's true. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=141.5s)]
*  He must be a big fan if he's going to do a comedy with them. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=142.5s)]
*  I mean, we can look that up. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=145.5s)]
*  Apparently, he has a comedy coming out. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=146.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's fact. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=148.5s)]
*  But, but, but, but, but, but, Al, but, Al, Al, Al, you're getting groomed right now. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=149.5s)]
*  We need to un-groom you. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=155.5s)]
*  Yeah, you're getting groomed. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=156.5s)]
*  We need to un-groom you right now. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=157.5s)]
*  Okay? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=158.5s)]
*  I mean, because he sent people, he said slide on. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=159.5s)]
*  What did he say? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=163.5s)]
*  Slide on? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=164.5s)]
*  Where's the line? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=165.5s)]
*  Where's the line? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=166.5s)]
*  He goes, let me get it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=167.5s)]
*  I'm going to hold that and squint my eye. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=168.5s)]
*  That was not a racist joke. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=169.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=172.5s)]
*  The N words that coon, the N words that being groomed, slide on both of them. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=173.5s)]
*  Whoa, that seems like a call to violence. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=178.5s)]
*  It does. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=181.5s)]
*  Why would he call to, if he's about protecting black people, why would the call to violence [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=182.5s)]
*  be towards the black dudes, not the white guy making the joke? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=186.9s)]
*  Well, you got to understand. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=192.5s)]
*  What? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=193.5s)]
*  No, no, no, you got to understand. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=194.5s)]
*  Because I snitch. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=195.5s)]
*  I cooperate. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=196.5s)]
*  I tell. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=197.5s)]
*  Litigation. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=198.5s)]
*  Okay? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=199.5s)]
*  You can go squabble up in a jail cell. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=200.5s)]
*  Here's what you got to understand about Kendrick. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=202.5s)]
*  It's very important to him to protect black women. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=204.5s)]
*  That's why he's never done a song with an abuser confirmed. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=207.3s)]
*  He's never done a song with anybody that's suspected of abuse. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=209.5s)]
*  He's never threatened to remove his music from Spotify because they removed R. Kelly's [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=214.5s)]
*  music, who for sure fucked and held captive underage black women. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=218.9s)]
*  Hold on, hold on, hold on. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=222.5s)]
*  This is all very important to Kendrick. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=223.5s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=224.5s)]
*  I really understand what's going on here because I think that you're using sarcasm as a comedic [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=225.5s)]
*  device. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=228.74s)]
*  It is a comedic device. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=229.74s)]
*  But you're so fucking smart right now that I don't know if you're serious or making jokes. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=230.74s)]
*  Are you saying that Kendrick Lamar put it on wax that he is protecting black women from [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=233.78s)]
*  white comedians jokes, but not the kidnapping, molestation and rape of R. Kelly? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=239.58s)]
*  And actually in reality, he would take his own music off Spotify to protect R. Kelly, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=246.38s)]
*  someone who's kidnapped, molested, black women, children. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=252.42s)]
*  Are you saying that he's done songs with other men who have potentially put hands on black [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=257.21999999999997s)]
*  women? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=262.41999999999996s)]
*  Not potentially, confirmed. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=263.41999999999996s)]
*  Women convicted? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=264.41999999999996s)]
*  I don't know what you call Chris Brown. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=265.41999999999996s)]
*  It's not breezy. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=268.41999999999996s)]
*  Not breezy. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=271.41999999999996s)]
*  I took a picture with Chris Brown. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=272.41999999999996s)]
*  Hey, bro, I took a picture with him immediately. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=274.41999999999996s)]
*  Can I tell you something? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=277.41999999999996s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=278.41999999999996s)]
*  We ain't protecting nobody. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=279.41999999999996s)]
*  Protect your fucking selves. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=280.42s)]
*  Everybody gets these jokes over here. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=282.5s)]
*  You've been telling me for a year straight Indians fuck mud. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=285.42s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=289.42s)]
*  Listen, they're going down on it too. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=290.42s)]
*  I've seen a lot of videos of them eating mud pussy, bro. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=292.42s)]
*  They literally put their head in the mud straight. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=295.42s)]
*  Reverse. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=299.42s)]
*  Back handspring. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=300.42s)]
*  At least we're going down on mud. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=301.42s)]
*  I'm calling the sutures. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=302.42s)]
*  At least we go down, Jamaicans. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=303.42s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=306.42s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=307.42s)]
*  You better watch out. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=308.42s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=310.42s)]
*  What the bumble cloud is going on? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=311.42s)]
*  You can't call out Jamaicans for something they're proud of. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=313.42s)]
*  That's true. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=316.42s)]
*  That's true. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=317.42s)]
*  My bad. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=318.42s)]
*  My bad. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=319.42s)]
*  That's super racist. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=320.42s)]
*  Al, can you speak on that as a Puerto Rican? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=321.42s)]
*  I believe I can fly out this podcast right now. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=322.42s)]
*  This is crazy, but keep cooking. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=325.42s)]
*  Al, we have to protect you. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=328.42s)]
*  They're trying to slide on you, bro. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=329.42s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=331.42s)]
*  They're trying to, this is nuts, dude. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=332.42s)]
*  This is, and listen, you're distracting. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=334.42s)]
*  That's their Splish Splash. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=336.42s)]
*  More than a Splish Splash? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=337.42s)]
*  I'm going to be honest, these kids look Asian. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=339.42s)]
*  I mean, I mean. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=343.42s)]
*  That means they're technical. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=344.42s)]
*  I mean, the other Asians. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=345.42s)]
*  I'm with you on that. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=346.42s)]
*  Anyway, can we get back to something that's really important? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=347.42s)]
*  Because there's a huge beef on the internet right now that we really need to address. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=349.42s)]
*  That's true. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=354.42s)]
*  Is there another beef? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=355.42s)]
*  There's not, I don't think there's another beef, but you don't know. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=356.42s)]
*  This is the only one I heard people talking about. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=359.42s)]
*  Can I ask you guys a serious question? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=361.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=363.42s)]
*  Because literally we filmed a special this past weekend. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=364.42s)]
*  Thank you guys so much for coming out. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=367.42s)]
*  I really appreciate that. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=368.42s)]
*  About to get into the edit, but yeah, you guys are amazing. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=370.42s)]
*  You killed it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=373.42s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=374.42s)]
*  Team killed it. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=375.42s)]
*  You guys were fucking incredible. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=376.42s)]
*  But listen, I shut off my phone for the week. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=377.42s)]
*  Like the week before Kendrick dropped his album, right? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=383.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=386.42s)]
*  Every black person that texts or calls me is like, yo, Kendrick just took a shot at you on the album. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=387.42s)]
*  Every white person or Asian person or Latino person that calls me is like, yo, good luck on your special. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=391.42s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=397.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=398.42s)]
*  So clearly there was a separation in who was indulging in this content. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=399.42s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=403.42s)]
*  So I've been a little out of it, but I come out of the special and it looks like there's so many articles about this album that are about, I don't want to, you know. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=404.42s)]
*  Yeah, it was about you. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=415.42s)]
*  You were trending on my Twitter. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=416.42s)]
*  No way. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=418.42s)]
*  I'm not telling you because you had things. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=419.42s)]
*  What a time to be alive where I was not one of the Asians who said, good luck on your special. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=420.42s)]
*  I'm just saying. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=425.42s)]
*  What a time to be alive where rappers got to talk about comedians for clout. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=426.42s)]
*  It's a God bless, dude. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=431.42s)]
*  Like we are upright. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=432.42s)]
*  The biggest story about the album outside of the album and people enjoying it was a sub at a comedian. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=434.42s)]
*  And you even got to say my name and it still makes headlines. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=442.42s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=445.42s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=446.42s)]
*  You are. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=447.42s)]
*  How many views did I give him? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=448.42s)]
*  You think a good chunk? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=450.42s)]
*  A little chunk. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=452.42s)]
*  They stole our mustard. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=453.42s)]
*  Couple of million. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=454.42s)]
*  They stole our mustard. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=455.42s)]
*  We've been doing honey mustard for fucking years. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=457.42s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=461.42s)]
*  They hop on that. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=462.42s)]
*  He'd be listening. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=463.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=464.42s)]
*  Of course he listens because he specifically I think was reacting to In That Shits and Gigs podcast, which I think they're reacting to. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=465.42s)]
*  I said something. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=473.42s)]
*  I asked them if they dated black women. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=474.42s)]
*  They were like, oh, we did all women. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=477.42s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, okay. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=478.42s)]
*  And then and then I go Kendrick fans get them. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=481.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=484.42s)]
*  And that's all it took. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=485.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=486.42s)]
*  That's all it took. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=487.42s)]
*  And now Kendrick want to talk some shit. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=488.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=490.42s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=491.42s)]
*  What do you guys think of the album though? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=492.42s)]
*  I mean, I like it. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=493.42s)]
*  Here's what I'll say about Kendrick. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=494.42s)]
*  Everybody knows I'm a fan, but like you got some slappers on there. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=495.42s)]
*  I went there trying to hate. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=498.42s)]
*  And then I listened to it again this morning and there was a few crazy, spooky, scary, hilarious. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=501.42s)]
*  I love Lefty Gunplay. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=508.42s)]
*  So anything he's on that's fine. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=509.42s)]
*  That whole song is crazy. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=511.42s)]
*  All the samples are like. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=512.4200000000001s)]
*  No, they killed it. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=513.4200000000001s)]
*  It's a good album. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=514.4200000000001s)]
*  Mother fuck you though. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=515.4200000000001s)]
*  Catching a stray on a slapper is fire. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=518.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=521.4200000000001s)]
*  It kills me. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=522.4200000000001s)]
*  I love it at the same time. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=523.4200000000001s)]
*  It's fire. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=525.4200000000001s)]
*  But I don't like him threatening the violence. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=526.4200000000001s)]
*  I don't like that. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=528.4200000000001s)]
*  I don't like him telling people to slide on you. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=529.42s)]
*  I'm a civilian. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=532.42s)]
*  I'm going to the cops too. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=533.42s)]
*  What if it's too late? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=534.42s)]
*  What if they fucking do something to you? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=535.42s)]
*  I mean, I don't leave my house. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=538.42s)]
*  Kendrick, I feel like Kendrick is talking all his shit and for whatever reason, we just [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=541.42s)]
*  letting him talk all this shit. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=547.42s)]
*  We decided we love him right now. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=549.42s)]
*  I get it. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=551.42s)]
*  I do get it. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=552.42s)]
*  But at the same time. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=553.42s)]
*  And I've always been a fan, but I also said this even in the Drake thing when he said [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=554.42s)]
*  the shit about your next show at the Bay, whatever he said basically kind of like call [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=558.42s)]
*  the violence. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=562.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=563.42s)]
*  Remember when Rick Ross got beat up? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=564.42s)]
*  I was like, yo, Kendrick, you got to fall back on that call to violence. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=565.42s)]
*  He's like Trump on January 6th. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=568.42s)]
*  Yo. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=570.42s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=571.42s)]
*  Like he's trying to get people to storm the Capitol a little bit. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=572.42s)]
*  He's trying to get people to go to hell. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=575.42s)]
*  Get people to go to Charlotte. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=577.42s)]
*  That's dangerous rhetoric out there. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=579.42s)]
*  Stand back. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=581.42s)]
*  Stand by. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=582.42s)]
*  Stand back and stand by. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=583.42s)]
*  He's not even saying that. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=584.42s)]
*  He's saying get up in that ass. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=585.42s)]
*  Get up in that ass. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=586.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=587.42s)]
*  But he is crazy. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=588.42s)]
*  But I need Kendrick. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=589.42s)]
*  I need you to do it, Kendrick. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=590.42s)]
*  You want to squabble up with Kenny? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=591.42s)]
*  I need to. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=592.42s)]
*  No, I mean, here's the thing. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=593.42s)]
*  This is the thing that is kind of funny about it is like, like, first of all, Kendrick's [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=594.42s)]
*  people and the gang affiliate, you know, everybody in his security, they will kill me. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=601.42s)]
*  They will destroy me. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=605.42s)]
*  They'll find me in the street. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=606.42s)]
*  They'll fucking cut me up. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=607.42s)]
*  They'll shoot. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=608.42s)]
*  They'll do whatever. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=609.42s)]
*  I'm not a tough guy. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=610.42s)]
*  Y'all would do. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=611.42s)]
*  But just Kendrick. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=612.42s)]
*  I would make love to him. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=614.42s)]
*  There's nothing he can do about it. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=615.42s)]
*  Just Kendrick Lamar. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=618.42s)]
*  I would make love to him. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=620.42s)]
*  And the only thing that he could do is decide if his consensual or not. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=622.42s)]
*  That's the only thing he could do. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=626.42s)]
*  If it's me and Kendrick. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=629.42s)]
*  If it's me and Kendrick. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=631.42s)]
*  You are stupid. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=633.42s)]
*  No. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=634.42s)]
*  This is about physics. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=635.42s)]
*  It's about physics. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=636.42s)]
*  I don't even know if I'll get hard. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=637.42s)]
*  But if we're in a cell, there's a chance that if we're in a cell and we're bored and we've [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=639.42s)]
*  done tattooing each other, whatever you do in the cell, and we ran out of board games [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=646.42s)]
*  and we did all the other things, we cleaned everything. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=650.42s)]
*  And I'm like, man, I might as well fuck you. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=652.42s)]
*  There's nothing he could physically do to stop that. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=655.42s)]
*  Besides put his legs in the air and choose a position. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=658.42s)]
*  Maybe I'll let him choose a position. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=661.42s)]
*  Why are you putting this picture on Mark? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=662.42s)]
*  Why are you doing this? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=664.42s)]
*  Put up that picture of him and Travis Kelcey's girl. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=666.42s)]
*  Look at that shit. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=669.42s)]
*  Oh my God, dude. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=670.42s)]
*  That's unbelievable. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=671.42s)]
*  I'll be honest. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=672.42s)]
*  I would go so far as to say I don't think he could stop most people on the planet from [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=673.42s)]
*  having sex with him. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=677.42s)]
*  Like the only reason he got security is to stop people from having sex with him whatever [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=679.42s)]
*  he wants. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=684.42s)]
*  Now, don't get me wrong. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=685.42s)]
*  There's people who could fuck me against my will. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=686.42s)]
*  I was in an elevator once with this drag queen and this motherfucker was like 6'5". [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=688.42s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=691.42s)]
*  And we're in the elevator and we're going down. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=692.42s)]
*  I'm like, yo, if he wanted to take it, I got to cause a ruckus or something like that. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=694.42s)]
*  I got to shit my pants. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=698.42s)]
*  I got to do something. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=700.42s)]
*  I got to do something to stop him. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=701.42s)]
*  I enjoy it. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=704.42s)]
*  I have no clue what they're into. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=705.42s)]
*  But I know with Kendrick that he's talking a lot of shit. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=706.42s)]
*  But if it came down to it, I could put him on my lap. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=711.42s)]
*  I could feed him a bottle. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=715.42s)]
*  I could put him on my lap. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=717.42s)]
*  I could feed him a bottle and make love to him if I wanted to. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=719.42s)]
*  There's nothing he could do about it. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=723.42s)]
*  I might not be hard. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=724.42s)]
*  Dick might just slap soft against his butt. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=725.42s)]
*  But you could just beat him up. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=726.42s)]
*  You don't have to fuck him. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=727.42s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=728.42s)]
*  We're not doing acts of physical violence over here. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=730.42s)]
*  That's what he's called. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=733.42s)]
*  He's an actor. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=734.42s)]
*  Sweet love. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=735.42s)]
*  He's an act of love. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=736.42s)]
*  You're a pacifist. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=737.42s)]
*  I'm saying I could be romantic with him and there's nothing he could do about it to the [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=738.42s)]
*  point I think I'm so charming he would just fall into it. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=741.42s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=745.42s)]
*  I think he would just be so charmed. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=746.42s)]
*  He would be like, damn, like, what, what, what, what, what, let me suck it up. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=748.42s)]
*  This is MLK's dream, right? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=752.42s)]
*  Yes, for real. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=754.42s)]
*  So we need to figure this out. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=756.42s)]
*  We need to figure it. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=760.42s)]
*  Like the only thing he could do is after I was finished, like write some words that rhyme [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=761.42s)]
*  together about it. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=766.42s)]
*  Oh, that album would be fire. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=767.42s)]
*  That would be a problem. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=769.42s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=770.42s)]
*  He can make some calls. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=771.42s)]
*  He can make some calls. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=772.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=773.42s)]
*  You want to talk about another album called Damn? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=774.42s)]
*  Sit down. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=776.42s)]
*  Reconn. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=777.42s)]
*  Aska penetrated. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=778.42s)]
*  Listen, but in all seriousness, we love Kendrick Lamar, our woke king. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=779.42s)]
*  And, and I think we're going to do our best to abide by his rules. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=791.42s)]
*  I don't know what his rules are about like me having sex with him if we're in a room [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=795.42s)]
*  together. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=799.42s)]
*  I don't think you'd want that. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=800.42s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=801.42s)]
*  Well, I'm assuming. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=802.42s)]
*  We got to wait about five years for him to make another album. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=803.42s)]
*  That's right. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=806.42s)]
*  There is a chance in five years he would make another album. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=807.42s)]
*  And the song about this is going to be sensational. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=810.42s)]
*  It's going to be absolutely sensational. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=814.42s)]
*  Don't you think? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=817.42s)]
*  He's going to have some bars for you at the Super Bowl. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=818.42s)]
*  Watch. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=821.42s)]
*  I mean, the irony that he's like, we need to protect women. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=822.42s)]
*  He's performing at the Super Bowl, which is literally the Super Bowl of beating the shit [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=826.42s)]
*  out of women guys. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=829.42s)]
*  This is the problem is like when you're on your way up, nobody looks at your hypocrisy [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=830.42s)]
*  because they want you to be on the throne. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=834.42s)]
*  So naturally human beings, we all have this. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=836.42s)]
*  Like we look at the number two and we're like, I see myself in you go out there, go get it. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=839.42s)]
*  Once you're on the throne, all we see is hypocrisy. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=845.42s)]
*  It's like Joe Biden with his son right now. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=847.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=849.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=850.42s)]
*  It's, you know, it's any time the person is in power and clearly Kendrick is number [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=851.42s)]
*  one right now. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=854.42s)]
*  Anytime he's out there, we're naturally going to be like, oh, I'm going to be a [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=855.42s)]
*  politician. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=859.42s)]
*  So we're, we're now we're looking back at what he's done and we're like, oh, you're [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=860.42s)]
*  this well guy. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=864.42s)]
*  But then you really do shit with people that are completely inconsistent with what you [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=865.42s)]
*  say you care about. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=870.42s)]
*  Maybe you're just using this as an identity to feed your narcissism and you can't just [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=872.42s)]
*  go out there and be a complete narcissist. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=877.42s)]
*  So you're going to masquerade as an altruist, someone who protects the community, but you [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=879.42s)]
*  only do it when it benefits you. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=883.42s)]
*  When you put out an album like where's all this love for black women when Kamala was [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=885.42s)]
*  like, was he out there riding? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=889.42s)]
*  She's Indian apparently. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=891.42s)]
*  Good ass point. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=894.42s)]
*  Good ass point. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=895.42s)]
*  She locked up too many of his dudes, you know. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=896.42s)]
*  What I hope is he's just a person who fucked up. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=899.42s)]
*  Like this is a line. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=902.42s)]
*  It was a throwaway line. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=903.42s)]
*  You should have thrown it away. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=904.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=905.42s)]
*  Just say you weren't talking about me. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=906.42s)]

*  Best of luck on top. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1162.42s)]
*  It's hard being on top, my boy. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1163.42s)]
*  It's hard being on top. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1164.9s)]
*  On top of. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1166.54s)]
*  Don't you do it. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1167.54s)]
*  I was asking. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1168.54s)]
*  Don't you do it. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1169.6599999999999s)]
*  Easier than being on bottom. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1170.6599999999999s)]
*  But I will say, as far as that line goes, we're going to make fun of everybody. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1171.6599999999999s)]
*  And that's just the reality of the matter is everyone gets these jokes. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1174.6599999999999s)]
*  That's the ethos of the show. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1177.6599999999999s)]
*  That's the ethos of the comedy that we do. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1178.6599999999999s)]
*  And the second you start, and he just might not be aware of it. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1179.6599999999999s)]
*  I don't know if he's doing it to sell records or if he's doing it because he just thinks [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1182.6599999999999s)]
*  it rhymes or it looks good. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1185.6599999999999s)]
*  Or he's taking advantage of like a viral moment knowing that we'll react and knowing the [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1187.6599999999999s)]
*  internet will react. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1190.6599999999999s)]
*  But the reality is the second you make a group protected, everything else becomes a group. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1191.6599999999999s)]
*  And the second you make a group protected, everything else becomes racist. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1196.78s)]
*  You're either racist to that group or you're racist to everybody else. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1199.78s)]
*  And when you make fun of everybody, that is the one beautiful thing that allows us to [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1204.78s)]
*  kind of come together and laugh at ourselves and each other. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1209.78s)]
*  I've been very fortunate to travel the world making fun of people of all different race, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1211.78s)]
*  religions, cultures to their face everywhere around the world. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1215.78s)]
*  That is everywhere. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1218.78s)]
*  And they've had an incredible sense of humor about it. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1219.78s)]
*  They are coming out specifically to see that happen. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1222.78s)]
*  So it's not something that's ever going to change. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1225.8999999999999s)]
*  And maybe it's something that he'll learn and maybe it's something that he'll start [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1227.8999999999999s)]
*  to understand a little bit more. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1230.8999999999999s)]
*  He might just not know really anything about comedy. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1231.8999999999999s)]
*  I know that sounds crazy, but it just might not be his thing. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1234.8999999999999s)]
*  And like he might just have that knee jerk reaction and he's just like, yo, this is wrong. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1238.8999999999999s)]
*  Maybe it's the only clip that got sent his way. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1242.8999999999999s)]
*  And if you only get sent one clip, then you're like, oh, fuck this guy. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1244.8999999999999s)]
*  But yeah, I just that was disappointing as a fan. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1247.8999999999999s)]
*  I was like, yeah, because you never want like imagine the person in your friend group going, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1250.8999999999999s)]
*  guys, can we not talk about Asian men for a little bit? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1255.02s)]
*  Yeah, a little bit like imagine one of your friends saying that. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1258.02s)]
*  Imagine he's not my friend. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1261.02s)]
*  No, we are killing that motherfucker for the next three months. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1263.02s)]
*  Remember that time when you were gay? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1266.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1268.02s)]
*  Remember you acted like a gay guy that time and for three months you just get destroyed. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1269.02s)]
*  Out of the group chat. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1273.02s)]
*  Yeah, immediately. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1274.02s)]
*  So you don't want to be Kung Fu Karen. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1275.02s)]
*  That is what ends up happening when you have this type of rhetoric. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1280.02s)]
*  Now, being on top is different. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1283.02s)]
*  Being on top is much harder. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1284.1399999999999s)]
*  It's way harder to lead. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1285.1399999999999s)]
*  It's easy to conquer. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1287.1399999999999s)]
*  It's hard to lead. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1288.1399999999999s)]
*  So we hope you we hope you do the best with your reign. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1290.1399999999999s)]
*  And if it's deserved, then it will be long. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1294.1399999999999s)]
*  And if it's not deserved, then it will be short. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1297.1399999999999s)]
*  And you're the one that decides that. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1299.1399999999999s)]
*  That's very mature. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1301.1399999999999s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1302.1399999999999s)]

*  We'll see you all next week with announcements for 2025. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1426.22s)]
*  What is going on with this Drake lawsuit? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1427.22s)]
*  Yeah, Mark, please break this down because on the surface, it seems embarrassing. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1429.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1433.22s)]
*  So, it's technically not a lawsuit. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1434.22s)]
*  Embarrassing. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1435.22s)]
*  Oh, whoa. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1436.22s)]
*  Technically, it's not a lawsuit. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1437.22s)]
*  It's a petition. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1438.22s)]
*  Hey, that don't make it better. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1439.22s)]
*  Well, technically, that don't make it better. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1442.22s)]
*  Well, I think the headline is like, oh, Drake suing Kendrick Lamar, which is not really [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1445.22s)]
*  true. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1449.3400000000001s)]
*  No, he's... [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1450.3400000000001s)]
*  Well, that... [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1451.3400000000001s)]
*  The headline is just suing UMG. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1452.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1453.3400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1454.3400000000001s)]
*  So, basically suing Kendrick, which is technically, there's like, I don't know the exact terms. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1456.3s)]
*  I can look it up. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1459.34s)]
*  But basically like pre-judicial, they're looking for documents. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1460.34s)]
*  They're suing to get evidence. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1462.6599999999999s)]
*  They're not suing. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1463.6599999999999s)]
*  They're petitioning to get evidence so that they could build a lawsuit. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1464.6599999999999s)]
*  To build a lawsuit if the evidence is there. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1466.58s)]
*  Against UMG and his attorneys are basically claiming that UMG was effectively boosting [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1469.22s)]
*  the streams on Kendrick Lamar's Not Like Us record. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1475.34s)]
*  And how would they do that? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1478.1799999999998s)]
*  By basically giving it at a discount for the royalties. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1479.58s)]
*  Can you explain how that works? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1481.98s)]
*  So, effectively the way I understand it is that in order to run a stream, then whenever [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1483.5s)]
*  you do the stream from a platform, you have to pay the label. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1488.94s)]
*  So Spotify would have to pay UMG. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1491.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1493.78s)]
*  And then UMG sets the stream at a price. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1494.78s)]
*  Correct. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1497.0600000000002s)]
*  And what you're saying, or Drake is alleging, is that UMG gave a discounted price to Spotify. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1498.0600000000002s)]
*  Correct. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1503.14s)]
*  That made them play it more because it was more advantageous to them. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1504.14s)]
*  They're like, oh my God, I get 30% off. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1507.46s)]
*  Let me just keep spinning this song. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1509.98s)]
*  Correct. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1511.54s)]
*  So this is an allegation that people within Spotify that quote had a perceived loyalty [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1512.6599999999999s)]
*  to Drake were fired. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1516.8999999999999s)]
*  And so this was like an apparent effort to conceal the scheme. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1520.06s)]
*  And then they also claimed that by boosting certain streams by one artist because there's [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1524.86s)]
*  a zero-sum game, that it also devalued Drake's ability to organically get streams. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1528.3799999999999s)]
*  So because Kendrick's stream is getting much more play because of zero-sum, Drake is getting [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1533.86s)]
*  less play. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1538.3799999999999s)]
*  Now, this is quite interesting because there's another component to this. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1540.22s)]
*  I don't know how true this is, but apparently Drake was in a contract negotiation with UMG [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1544.0600000000002s)]
*  at the time. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1552.46s)]
*  He had just delivered, I think on his last contract, which was like $400 million. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1553.46s)]
*  And now he's re-upping. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1557.8200000000002s)]
*  He's like, how do I get a $600 million contract? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1558.8200000000002s)]
*  And UMG, I think, was basically like, we don't want to give you even $400 million. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1561.8200000000002s)]
*  We want to give you less. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1565.7800000000002s)]
*  So I think he's alleging that they boosted this Not Like Us song so that it could hurt [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1568.1s)]
*  Drake's stock so that they would have a better negotiation for his upcoming album. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1576.98s)]
*  A lot of sports franchises do that? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1582.98s)]
*  I was about to say, 100%. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1584.74s)]
*  So NFL players had a great year. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1586.26s)]
*  He's about to re-sign, and all of a sudden a video comes out of him doing Coke with a [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1590.02s)]
*  hooker. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1593.3s)]
*  You could make the argument that the team holds on to that information, and then when [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1595.1s)]
*  it's time for contracts, they drop it. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1598.54s)]
*  You've heard this? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1601.9399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1602.9399999999998s)]
*  So that's, I think, that is now, whether this is true or not, first of all, I mean, obviously [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1603.9399999999998s)]
*  suing in a situation like this, you lose all street cred. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1608.9799999999998s)]
*  Also like, he's being called a pedophile in the song, but didn't he tell Kendrick to call [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1612.5s)]
*  him a pedophile in his earlier song? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1620.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1623.1s)]
*  Wait, what do you mean? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1624.98s)]
*  Like he had a bar, like Taylor made freestyle. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1626.62s)]
*  You know, talk about the video of me kissing a 16-year-old. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1628.26s)]
*  Like when he tried to M&M himself where he says all the things. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1631.02s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1633.8999999999999s)]
*  And then Kendrick was like, okay. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1634.8999999999999s)]
*  For the record also, Universal and Spotify said that it's untrue. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1637.74s)]
*  Well, the 30% discount thing apparently- [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1640.74s)]
*  That is true though, right? [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1642.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the 30% discount thing is true, but apparently that's been done before, and I [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1643.8999999999999s)]
*  think it's been done for Drake. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1647.2199999999998s)]
*  Essentially, something, this might not be it, but something like when you become the [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1648.98s)]
*  featured artist on a Spotify page, UMG might say, hey, if you do that, we'll discount [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1652.34s)]
*  the licensing fee or whatever. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1657.22s)]
*  And then Spotify is incentivizing, be like, okay, bet. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1659.3s)]
*  And Drake was all over Spotify and Apple Music for I think Gemini or Scorpio. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1661.5s)]
*  Guaranteed whatever they're doing for this song, they have done with Drake. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1665.98s)]
*  They've done with all their artists. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1670.3s)]
*  It's marketing, right? [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1672.34s)]
*  And like, so he's alleging Paola, he's alleging all these other things. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1673.6999999999998s)]
*  There's an interesting argument here, which is like Drake really feels like this song [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1677.1s)]
*  isn't actually a hit. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1680.54s)]
*  Like he's been talking about bots and he's been talking about all these things from the [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1682.26s)]
*  beginning. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1685.3799999999999s)]
*  And I wonder if it comes from this place of Drake's never really heard the song out, because [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1686.3799999999999s)]
*  whenever he's out, nobody plays the song. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1692.06s)]
*  So I wonder if like, he's the dude who's out. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1695.1399999999999s)]
*  He's at the club, he's doing different things, he's at social events. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1697.5s)]
*  He's not hearing the song ever. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1700.82s)]
*  And I wonder if in his mind, he's like, I don't think motherfuckers are playing it. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1702.7s)]
*  Now it's delusional. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1706.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he's also heavy online. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1707.1399999999999s)]
*  He's so plugged in. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1709.02s)]
*  But yeah, but there's got to be some disconnect where he would even go bots. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1711.54s)]
*  He would even believe all of the allegations that he's claiming are true. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1715.8999999999999s)]
*  Are true. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1721.34s)]
*  But also true for every artist. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1722.34s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1723.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1724.82s)]
*  So you just crying when it happened to you, not when you benefit, but also the nature [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1725.82s)]
*  of it happening is slightly different. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1729.4199999999998s)]
*  Like him just promoting a standard album is one thing, but this is a direct album that's [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1730.74s)]
*  not just also trying to float, but actively aggressing towards him. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1734.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1738.54s)]
*  Like it's actively defaming his reputation. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1739.54s)]
*  But that is the nature of a rap battle. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1741.3799999999999s)]
*  It's like he if they if they boosted his Taylor Mates or meet the grams or whatever it is, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1743.06s)]
*  it would also defame. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1748.58s)]
*  I'm fairly certain they boosted Family Matters and they must have boosted Back to Back. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1750.58s)]
*  Back to Back, slap, it was a crazy hit. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1756.6599999999999s)]
*  But I'm positive again, like you said, bots are just everywhere. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1758.52s)]
*  They're just working every song. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1761.62s)]
*  Back to Back was the fucking song of the year, whatever year it came. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1763.3s)]
*  I got a question. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1766.1s)]
*  Is this their PR company, like a Drake PR company? [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1767.18s)]
*  Like I see this with Drake. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1770.54s)]
*  I see this with The Weeknd. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1771.54s)]
*  I see it's a bunch of artists. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1772.54s)]
*  Every like few days, there's an onslaught of every Instagram page that's like about music [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1775.5s)]
*  has more or less the same post where it's just like Drake is the number one most listened [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1783.74s)]
*  to artist and they all have a different variation of the same post and it all comes out. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1788.26s)]
*  And as I'm scrolling casually, I go, man, he's popping this motherfucker, whatever. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1793.34s)]
*  But I wonder if that is a PR agency, that it's their job to constantly push the narrative [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1797.24s)]
*  that this person is the number one artist. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1802.42s)]
*  So that is a coordinated effort. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1804.68s)]
*  Wow, I feel so stupid to just put that together now. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1806.66s)]
*  Here I am thinking if we don't get a write up about something, you know, or if we're [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1811.3799999999999s)]
*  not included in a list or something like that, we're like, I guess nobody just acknowledges [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1815.94s)]
*  us. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1819.3799999999999s)]
*  Because we just didn't push it out there to tell them to say that. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1820.3799999999999s)]
*  Paying a PR agency to constantly push the narrative. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1822.06s)]
*  I put together there are certain people. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1825.14s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1826.94s)]
*  All that stuff, all the Instagram pages, even like old train magazines, I think people know [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1827.94s)]
*  like World Sexiest Man in America. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1831.26s)]
*  That's all paid. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1833.98s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1834.98s)]
*  But it's effective. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1837.3400000000001s)]
*  Because I'm not, I wouldn't even call myself a casual. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1838.3400000000001s)]
*  I'm like pretty into media. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1841.1000000000001s)]
*  And I'm being, I don't want to say duped, but I'm believing the narrative. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1843.6000000000001s)]
*  I'm like, oh my God, this must be the biggest thing in the world. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1848.1000000000001s)]
*  Here we are busting our ass on our own Instagram. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1850.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1852.9399999999998s)]
*  Hoping people see it. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1853.9399999999998s)]
*  When in reality for way less money, you could just pay 20 other Instagram pages and then [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1854.9399999999998s)]
*  you'll feel like it's inescapable. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1859.82s)]
*  It feels decentralized. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1861.98s)]
*  Because you're going through it and you're like all of these disparate things that have [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1863.98s)]
*  nothing to do with each other are all promoting the same narrative. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1867.02s)]
*  And this is beyond music. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1869.78s)]
*  I mean, politicians use this. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1870.78s)]
*  There were comedians who were coming up when we used to take, we used to really care about [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1871.78s)]
*  those like hottest comedians. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1875.9399999999998s)]
*  There were some comedians that they were funny, sure, but early on they were on every fucking [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1877.66s)]
*  list and you were like, what the hell is going on? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1881.46s)]
*  So they got their agents or their PR company. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1883.3400000000001s)]
*  The manager, the PR, the manager probably boom, boom, boom, boom. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1885.3400000000001s)]
*  And then you start to buy in this guy, this is the hot spot. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1888.94s)]
*  And a lot of these block sites, the way they work, it's like you just send it to a couple [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1890.94s)]
*  of the top ones and then all down. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1894.5s)]
*  The word, is it inescapable? [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1898.18s)]
*  Inescapable. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1900.78s)]
*  The inescapability of it, I think is the greatest like motivating factor because when you see [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1902.18s)]
*  10 things online, it feels like the biggest story. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1908.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1912.82s)]
*  Right? [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1913.82s)]
*  Like with, I mean, what happened with the Kendrick thing? [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1914.82s)]
*  It's like you're online and you see every single post is about it. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1916.1s)]
*  They're like, oh, Kendrick takes shots and Schultz or whatever. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1920.1s)]
*  And you're like, oh wow, this feels big. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1922.22s)]
*  In the grand scheme of things, it's nothing. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1924.62s)]
*  Nobody gives a fuck. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1927.5s)]
*  But the perception, how's, wow, I know I must sound like an absolute retard right now, but [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1929.54s)]
*  if this works with... [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1937.02s)]
*  I was too. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1938.02s)]
*  I didn't know it. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1939.02s)]
*  But if this works for like a random narrative around a rap song or a rapper or whatever, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1940.02s)]
*  imagine what they're feeding to us politically. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1945.4199999999998s)]
*  Imagine what they're feeding to us culturally. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1948.1399999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, dude. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1949.78s)]
*  We'll get to it with the Biden stuff. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1950.78s)]
*  But you can hear the same line from different media outlets. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1952.78s)]
*  Sorry about Joe Biden and defending this exact line. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1955.7s)]
*  Boom, boom, boom, boom. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1959.22s)]
*  What'd you say? [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1960.22s)]
*  Decentralization? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1961.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1962.22s)]
*  That is where it becomes so effective. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1963.22s)]
*  When it feels like everyone around you shares the opinion, if you don't have the opinion, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1965.46s)]
*  you go, I must be wrong. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1970.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1971.22s)]
*  You just automatically conform. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1972.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1973.22s)]
*  Bro, you wonder if Kendrick put that lyric in there because he knew you were going to [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1974.22s)]
*  talk about it? [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1977.74s)]
*  Of course. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1978.74s)]
*  And then you were going to promote the album? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1979.74s)]
*  Of course. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1981.46s)]
*  He didn't count on us taking Thanksgiving off. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1983.26s)]
*  Crazy, spooky, scary, hilarious. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1985.26s)]
*  It was a special of film. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1990.26s)]
*  Mmmmm. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1991.26s)]
*  Mmmmm. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1992.26s)]
*  Hits with a nice style better episode. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1993.26s)]
*  Take that. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1996.26s)]
*  Okay? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1997.26s)]
*  But now we talk about it. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=1998.26s)]
*  He fucking got us. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2000.26s)]
*  God damn. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2001.26s)]
*  He's fucking smart, man. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2002.26s)]
*  Yeah, but how many Easter eggs do we have in this episode that you didn't even realize? [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2003.26s)]
*  Dude, there's so many. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2006.26s)]
*  Ooh, Kendrick, there's so many Easter eggs. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2007.26s)]
*  Find them! [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2012.06s)]
*  Nope, you just missed one. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2013.06s)]
*  Oh, there was one. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2014.06s)]
*  Let's see if you can rewind it and find it. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2017.06s)]
*  The total time in the episode was 366 seconds. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2019.06s)]
*  Even the rap beef between Kendrick and Drake, I think in the grand scheme of things, the [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2024.06s)]
*  entire world didn't really care. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2028.76s)]
*  Like Drake is still going to be the top streaming artist or rap artist, but to us, that was [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2030.46s)]
*  the only thing. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2036.26s)]
*  Yeah, it's fascinating. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2037.26s)]
*  We think like Drake has been dethroned, he hasn't. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2038.26s)]
*  He's still going to out stream. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2041.0600000000002s)]
*  But what way? [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2042.0600000000002s)]
*  Numbers? [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2043.0600000000002s)]
*  Numbers. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2044.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I just think Drake is... [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2045.0600000000002s)]
*  Cultural influence? [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2046.0600000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2047.0600000000002s)]
*  Maybe a little bit here, but I think worldwide, though. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2048.06s)]
*  This is, I think this is, and I think it's smart what he's doing now. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2052.06s)]
*  He's going to do a little tour in Australia. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2056.06s)]
*  I thought that was really smart because the way that Kendrick timed this beef was brilliant. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2059.06s)]
*  Right when you finish your tour, I'm going to go to war with you and you have nothing [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2065.46s)]
*  to show that you're popping. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2071.06s)]
*  Right? [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2075.06s)]
*  Because the beauty of having a tour is say whatever you want. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2076.06s)]
*  Videos are coming out. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2080.2599999999998s)]
*  That's reality. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2081.86s)]
*  All this is chit chat and comments online. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2082.86s)]
*  That's reality. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2086.06s)]
*  Right? [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2087.06s)]
*  There's some people that said some shit about me online or made videos about me online. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2088.06s)]
*  But then when we post The Garden, Crypto, The Forum, the Etihad Arena, the arenas in [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2091.5s)]
*  Australia, literally the arenas Drake is playing in Australia, the arenas that we play in Australia, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2099.62s)]
*  it's like it's very hard to believe that when you're seeing the reality of people showing [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2103.94s)]
*  up. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2110.22s)]
*  And I think Drake needs a nice win. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2111.22s)]
*  Drake needs the... [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2113.1s)]
*  You know what the tour is called? [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2114.5s)]
*  Anita Max Windbuehler. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2115.5s)]
*  Yeah, that I didn't think was smart. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2116.5s)]
*  It felt a little desperate. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2118.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2119.8s)]
*  Drake off the hook. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2121.0s)]
*  This is the dumbest thing he could have possibly done. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2122.0s)]
*  This suing shit. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2124.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2125.7200000000003s)]
*  Like this is... [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2126.7200000000003s)]
*  He looks so fucking corny. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2127.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and that's what I would say to anybody who says his streams aren't going to be up [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2128.7200000000003s)]
*  because Drake is a pop star. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2132.0s)]
*  He just is. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2133.92s)]
*  It's like saying Nelly out, he outsold, I don't know, Jay-Z maybe in the year 2000, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2134.92s)]
*  from 2000 to 2007. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2141.1600000000003s)]
*  That don't make him a better rapper than Jay-Z or nobody's going to put him on a rap [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2142.96s)]
*  list above Jay-Z. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2147.4799999999996s)]
*  But it was pop music that hit. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2148.4799999999996s)]
*  Drake has pop music that hits, so he's always going to be crazy ahead on streams. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2151.0s)]
*  I just think as a rapper, he's moving horribly. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2154.56s)]
*  Anita Max Wind, not a great name for a tour. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2158.72s)]
*  The lawsuit, it's like you already got embarrassed and now you're just embarrassing yourself. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2160.52s)]
*  What do you do? [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2164.24s)]
*  But what if it goes to a lawsuit and then he's able to win and successfully prove in [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2165.24s)]
*  a court that Kendrick's streams were inflated? [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2168.3999999999996s)]
*  No one cares. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2170.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2171.64s)]
*  The song was still fire. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2172.64s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2173.64s)]
*  No one cares. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2174.64s)]
*  This is the thing that he's messing up. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2176.04s)]
*  If the song wasn't a slapper, but it was really popular, I think that we'd be like, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2178.04s)]
*  ah, that makes sense. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2183.24s)]
*  The song goes crazy. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2184.7999999999997s)]
*  It's almost as good as Whacked Out Murals. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2186.92s)]
*  It's really on that level. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2190.96s)]
*  I might be biased, but it's on that level of Whacked Out Murals. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2194.2s)]
*  But what if Not Like Us had a thing about what jokes were funny? [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2198.24s)]
*  Then do you think it would have been just the greatest of all time? [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2201.16s)]
*  Greatest song of all time. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2202.8799999999997s)]
*  You could charge Spotify double. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2204.12s)]
*  We're still streaming it. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2205.12s)]
*  That shit would have beat Thriller. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2206.12s)]
*  That would have been a good Thriller. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2207.12s)]
*  Yeah, if you said it about Euphoria, and I love Euphoria, but we'd be like, oh yeah, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2210.12s)]
*  Euphoria being the number one song on the world team is a little weird. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2216.28s)]
*  But Not Like Us, you hear it outside everywhere and everybody's rapping every lyric when it [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2219.32s)]
*  comes on. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2225.36s)]
*  Dot, fuck him up. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2226.36s)]
*  Is that? [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2227.36s)]
*  Yeah, dot, fuck him up. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2228.36s)]
*  That shit is crazy. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2229.36s)]
*  No, listen, he's really good at making music. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2230.36s)]
*  As annoying as he can be, he's also very good at making music. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2234.24s)]
*  Some of the stuff I'm like, okay, whatever. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2238.92s)]
*  But sometimes you hear it and you're like, what the fuck? [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2241.2s)]
*  This guy's phenomenal at the craft of making music. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2243.82s)]
*  So saying that somebody's using bots that's also really good at making music, it's a tough [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2247.64s)]
*  pill to swallow for, I think. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2254.36s)]
*  And has been co-signed by every other goat. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2255.84s)]
*  Every other goat also says, no, this guy's a fucking truth. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2258.56s)]
*  You can't just say, oh, only casuals like him. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2262.48s)]
*  If I hate on Drake, but Snoop, Jay-Z, whoever, every one of them is like, nah, that guy is [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2265.68s)]
*  different. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2270.56s)]
*  I'm a dickhead. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2271.56s)]
*  Fucking Snoop apologized. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2272.56s)]
*  To whom? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2273.56s)]
*  To Kendrick. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2274.56s)]
*  What'd he say? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2275.56s)]
*  What'd Kendrick say about Snoop? [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2276.56s)]
*  So remember when Drake put out the diss where he was using the AI and Snoop reposted it. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2279.56s)]
*  And Kendrick's like, yo, how you gonna do that? [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2286.96s)]
*  You must have ate animals. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2289.64s)]
*  He said it must have been the edibles. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2290.7599999999998s)]
*  He said, like, I prayed it was the edibles or something like that. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2291.7599999999998s)]
*  Basically like, why is a West Coast guy big up in someone else using Koopah's voice and [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2294.0s)]
*  whatever. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2298.3599999999997s)]
*  And then Snoop tweeted, GNX album is fire. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2299.3599999999997s)]
*  You're right, Kendrick, it was the edibles or something like that with the laughing, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2304.3199999999997s)]
*  crying emoji. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2306.56s)]
*  Snoop's the man. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2307.56s)]
*  Snoop could do whatever he wants, bro. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2308.56s)]
*  That's OG. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2309.56s)]
*  But that's like Snoop could do whatever he wants. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2310.56s)]
*  And the fact that he even retracted that, that is, they're respecting Kendrick like [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2312.2s)]
*  that. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2316.7599999999998s)]
*  Like Drake is every step, even the fucking going on streaming and the betting and doing [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2317.88s)]
*  little subliminals like you can tell he's still hurt. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2322.76s)]
*  Going at DeMar DeRozan. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2325.7200000000003s)]
*  He's still hurt. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2326.7200000000003s)]
*  He's still bothered. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2327.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I think Drake, like most people in entertainment, care deeply what people think of him. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2328.7200000000003s)]
*  And they crave approval. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2336.44s)]
*  And now for the first time in 20 years, Drake believes that the perception of him might [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2339.24s)]
*  be skewed. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2347.48s)]
*  It might be he's a pedophile or it might be he's, I don't think that people really believe [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2349.28s)]
*  he's a pedophile. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2354.28s)]
*  Do you guys think that they really believe that about Drake? [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2356.4s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2358.88s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2359.88s)]
*  But it's just a funny thing. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2360.88s)]
*  It's a funny punch line, right? [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2361.88s)]
*  But I think that that really affects him. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2364.06s)]
*  Listen, he is a performer. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2367.24s)]
*  He is an artist. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2369.5200000000004s)]
*  He does something in front of a crowd. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2370.5200000000004s)]
*  We know a lot about that. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2372.0400000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2373.0400000000004s)]
*  We're affected by what people think about us. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2374.0400000000004s)]
*  I absolutely am. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2375.0400000000004s)]
*  And that's got to be fucking tough, especially when you've been loved by everybody. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2376.0400000000004s)]
*  A reign that we have never seen. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2382.0400000000004s)]
*  Phenomenal. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2384.1200000000003s)]
*  Maybe all, not all the music, but definitely rap. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2385.1200000000003s)]
*  We never seen someone on top for a decade plus, 15 years on top. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2387.2400000000002s)]
*  Even when push exposed him for whatever. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2392.6400000000003s)]
*  Came back. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2394.8s)]
*  Right back within a month. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2395.8s)]
*  You know how Drake wins this? [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2397.36s)]
*  Just threatened to make sweet love to Kendrick. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2399.88s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2401.6800000000003s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2402.6800000000003s)]
*  Because we saw that piece. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2403.6800000000003s)]
*  That piece is real. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2404.6800000000003s)]
*  That piece is real. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2405.6800000000003s)]

*  Best team in the league, according to most people, Packers are a little up and down, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2668.52s)]
*  but still very good. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2673.52s)]
*  They're like 9-3, I think. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2674.52s)]
*  But it's a divisional game. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2676.52s)]
*  And I think it's in Detroit, but still it's going to be a fucking good game. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2678.52s)]
*  I actually think Green Bay has a chance. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2682.52s)]
*  I think Detroit has been kind of... [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2684.52s)]
*  They had some huge wins, massive wins, but they had a few in a row, it seems like, where [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2686.52s)]
*  they just kind of squeaked by. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2690.52s)]
*  Why are they so good this year? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2691.52s)]
*  I know they were good last year, but like... [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2692.52s)]
*  I think the offensive coordinator's name is Ben Johnson. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2694.52s)]
*  He's like a fucking amazing... [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2697.6s)]
*  Like, really creative play designs. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2699.6s)]
*  A good offensive coordinator can level up the play of the quarterback. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2701.6s)]
*  Jared Goff has been fairly good his whole career. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2705.6s)]
*  Nothing incredible at all. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2707.6s)]
*  But this year he's like playing out of his mind. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2708.6s)]
*  Stud. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2710.6s)]
*  So I think that's the main thing. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2711.6s)]
*  And then I think the coach, Dan Campbell, made like a culture that is like truly... [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2713.6s)]
*  He's legit. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2716.6s)]
*  Did you watch the Hard Knocks at all? [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2717.6s)]
*  No. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2718.6s)]
*  It's a show I don't normally care for, but if you watched the Detroit Lions on from like [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2719.6s)]
*  two years ago when he first got there, it's awesome. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2723.6s)]
*  You love this guy. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2725.6s)]
*  You love playing for him. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2726.68s)]
*  You love rooting for him. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2727.68s)]
*  And they've just all bought in. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2729.68s)]
*  In a way that I didn't know if they could recover from San Francisco, but they did. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2730.68s)]
*  I think the coach said something that was... [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2734.68s)]
*  He said something about that loss. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2737.68s)]
*  He's like, well, this is the hardest thing. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2738.68s)]
*  It's getting your team back up to go do it again. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2740.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2743.68s)]
*  Like when you reach almost the mountaintop, that's a far way to go. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2744.68s)]
*  And they had a big lead and they blew it. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2747.68s)]
*  They just fell apart. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2748.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2749.68s)]
*  And I don't know if they'll fall apart this year. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2750.68s)]
*  The Eagles look really good. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2752.68s)]
*  The Packers look good. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2753.68s)]
*  They could lose. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2754.68s)]
*  The Sequa-Barkley turnaround is unbelievable. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2755.7599999999998s)]
*  Unbelievable, dude. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2757.7599999999998s)]
*  And what is it? [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2758.7599999999998s)]
*  It's just like, is it better play calling? [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2759.7599999999998s)]
*  Is it better line? [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2761.7599999999998s)]
*  I think he's healthier and it's a good offensive line. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2762.7599999999998s)]
*  Good offensive line makes the biggest difference, but also he's just healthy this time. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2764.7599999999998s)]
*  I think we love these stories because there's always a little bit in us this feeling like [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2767.7599999999998s)]
*  if I was given the opportunity... [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2772.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and he was kind of disrespected by the Giants in free agency, which we all identify [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2774.7599999999998s)]
*  with, feeling disrespected, unappreciated by employers, blah, blah, blah. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2778.7599999999998s)]
*  So we're all kind of rooting for him. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2781.7599999999998s)]
*  The other game that's going to be really good though is the Chiefs and Chargers. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2783.84s)]
*  I think the Chargers actually have a shot at this. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2786.84s)]
*  Why? [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2789.84s)]
*  Because the Chiefs just keep beating... [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2790.84s)]
*  They barely beat everyone. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2791.84s)]
*  They're winning every fucking time. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2792.84s)]
*  It's like defying all probability, but they're winning every game by like three points, two points. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2794.84s)]
*  But isn't there a little part of you that goes, that's because when the going gets tough, [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2799.84s)]
*  they have another level they can get to? [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2806.84s)]
*  I think so, but the Bills beat them, I think, pretty handily, I think. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2808.84s)]
*  And the Bills are really good. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2812.92s)]
*  They're like a truly good team. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2813.92s)]
*  And I think the Chargers with Jim Harbaugh as their new coach, and he's a quarterback guy, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2814.92s)]
*  I think they're a good team. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2818.92s)]
*  So you're going... [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2820.92s)]
*  What are your picks? [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2821.92s)]
*  I think I go Lions, and I think I go Chargers. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2822.92s)]
*  Wow. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2825.92s)]
*  But I don't know what the spreads are or anything like that. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2826.92s)]
*  Those are teams I think will win. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2828.92s)]
*  But yeah, I think the Chargers can actually beat the Chiefs. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2829.92s)]
*  I think, again... [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2832.92s)]
*  I mean, that's probably the money right there. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2833.92s)]
*  Yeah, my home seems to pull it out, but like that, those would be my picks. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2834.92s)]
*  But this is a fun football season, man. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2838.92s)]
*  There's a... [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2841.0s)]
*  I can't believe... [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2842.0s)]
*  I know people are going to be so excited when I make this analogy with paddle, but I've [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2843.0s)]
*  noticed if we're playing against people that are better than us, and it goes to like a [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2851.0s)]
*  golden point, I don't know if they do this in tennis at all, where it's like deuce and [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2854.0s)]
*  you just go, okay, whoever wins the next one. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2857.0s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2859.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2860.0s)]
*  So I notice if we're playing with people that are better than us, it might get to golden, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2861.0s)]
*  but they win every golden. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2865.0s)]
*  And that's because they have that extra level, and they just took their foot off the gas [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2866.0s)]
*  a little bit. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2870.08s)]
*  We got kind of close. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2871.08s)]
*  We think we can close it. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2872.08s)]
*  It's like, no, they have another fucking level. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2873.08s)]
*  And I feel like that's Pat Mahomes. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2874.08s)]
*  He has that kind of Brady-esque composure where it's like, if you let him stay in the [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2876.08s)]
*  game late, he's going to make something happen. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2881.08s)]
*  So you need to like really pad that fucking lead against him. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2885.08s)]
*  Yeah, I guess actually the Bills game did get close, now that I think about it. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2888.08s)]
*  But yeah, that could be it. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2891.08s)]
*  But the NFL, the talent disparity is not what... [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2892.08s)]
*  Because of free agency and all these other things, there's a lot more parity. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2895.08s)]
*  So it's not like you can just slide by doing that forever. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2898.16s)]
*  Sorry, go, go, go. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2901.16s)]
*  The talent gap between you and the guys across from you from the net is probably pretty big. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2902.16s)]
*  Yeah, big. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2906.16s)]
*  This is not... [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2907.16s)]
*  The NFL is... [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2908.16s)]
*  I mean, he's the best, but like, you know... [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2909.16s)]
*  Can you tell me the Derek Henry story that I keep hearing about? [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2910.16s)]
*  Derek Henry, God... [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2913.16s)]
*  There's like a resurgence and... [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2914.16s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2916.16s)]
*  So he... [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2917.16s)]
*  The idea is that running backs... [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2918.16s)]
*  You don't pay him after 30. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2919.16s)]
*  Derek Henry is one of the best running backs ever, maybe. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2922.16s)]
*  And he enters free agency. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2925.16s)]
*  He says kind of openly, I want to play for Dallas. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2927.24s)]
*  Dallas is like, no, we want to save our money. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2930.24s)]
*  We're so cheap. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2932.24s)]
*  We're like the fucking Clippers from back in the day. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2933.24s)]
*  We just don't spend on free agents. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2935.24s)]
*  They don't sign them. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2936.24s)]
*  Baltimore picks him up and he's having a crazy year. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2937.24s)]
*  But he's like insanely dedicated. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2940.24s)]
*  Like one of these Tom Brady type diets. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2942.24s)]
*  That's what I've heard about him. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2944.24s)]
*  No fried food, no refined sugar, intermittent fasting, won't eat until after his workout. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2945.24s)]
*  But like, if he does eat, it'll be like a banana or half an avocado suffering. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2950.24s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2954.24s)]
*  But then also the play that went viral in Thanksgiving is he got like to handle, handily tackled by some little white cornerback. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2955.3199999999997s)]
*  Oh, Dejan? [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2962.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2963.3199999999997s)]
*  Cooper Dejan is his name. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2964.3199999999997s)]
*  But it was tricky. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2965.3199999999997s)]
*  Like he was catching a screen, so he didn't really build up momentum. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2966.3199999999997s)]
*  I mean, the tackle was beautiful. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2969.3199999999997s)]
*  And the tackle was great. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2970.3199999999997s)]
*  Fucking beautiful. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2971.3199999999997s)]
*  But yeah, Derek Henry is still a problem. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2972.3199999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2974.3199999999997s)]
*  And is this another one of these cool stories where the two running backs that could potentially [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2975.3199999999997s)]
*  break the running back record were guys that potentially were afterthoughts? [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2978.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, like kind of just not wanted by their old teams and nobody was really going [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2982.4s)]
*  phrasing phrase. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2986.56s)]
*  These are the storylines you need in sports. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2987.56s)]
*  I feel like outside of who's going to win the, there's the who's going to win the championship. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2989.56s)]
*  And then there's like the, the underdogs. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2993.56s)]
*  You can't really call personal. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2996.56s)]
*  But these like personal stories where you can relate to them outside of them actually [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=2998.56s)]
*  winning the final game. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3002.56s)]
*  And team, team wise, underdog wise, Buffalo looks like at the moment the best team in [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3004.56s)]
*  the league. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3008.56s)]
*  Historically, never won anything. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3009.56s)]
*  Super loyal fans, the best Bills Mafia. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3011.7999999999997s)]
*  You almost want them to get one like. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3014.7999999999997s)]
*  And then the other one is Detroit. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3016.7999999999997s)]
*  Detroit, like we all feel bad for Detroit as a city. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3018.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3021.7999999999997s)]
*  And then all of a sudden the best team in the league, this is the best record they've [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3022.7999999999997s)]
*  ever had through 12 games. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3024.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3025.7999999999997s)]
*  So like those two storylines alone in each conference is enough to make this exciting. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3026.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3029.7999999999997s)]
*  The Chargers are good again. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3030.7999999999997s)]
*  Jim Harbaugh's kind of taking this quarterback that we thought might not be good and turning [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3031.7999999999997s)]
*  or might be falling apart and turning him around. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3035.24s)]
*  It's like there's so many storylines going right now. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3037.24s)]
*  It's so fun. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3039.24s)]
*  I don't feel like that's what they're doing. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3040.24s)]
*  I'm curious to see what happens once the Netflix games come on. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3041.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it's going to be interesting. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3044.9199999999996s)]
*  Because it's to me, it's just and I know people can do it because they have YouTube TV on [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3046.9199999999996s)]
*  their phone or whatever like that. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3051.9199999999996s)]
*  But it just seems so much easier to open up the app and watch the game. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3052.9199999999996s)]
*  The Tyson Paul fight proved that. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3057.9199999999996s)]
*  60 million households. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3059.9199999999996s)]
*  Insanity. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3061.9199999999996s)]
*  It's just so much easier. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3062.9199999999996s)]
*  I think that it's going to be very hard to not open up your phone and just watch a little [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3063.9199999999996s)]
*  of the game. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3069.9199999999996s)]
*  In the same way that now that the pay per views are one click away on your phone, I'm [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3071.6s)]
*  watching every single one. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3074.6s)]
*  It's also just habit. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3075.6s)]
*  The first thing most people go to is Netflix. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3076.6s)]
*  If they're on TV, on their smart TV, first app I open is Netflix. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3077.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3081.6s)]
*  And then that transition for sports because sports was the last one. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3082.6s)]
*  They're the last one that needed to. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3085.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3087.56s)]
*  Right? [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3088.56s)]
*  Because we're going to watch the fucking games no matter what. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3089.56s)]
*  But if those numbers double, triple, skyrocket, what does that do for the brand? [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3090.56s)]
*  And how much will Netflix pay for the rights? [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3096.6s)]
*  Because networks would pay everything because sports is one of the few things you have to [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3099.0s)]
*  watch live. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3102.0s)]
*  There's like a few TV shows, maybe every year, maybe. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3103.0s)]
*  Maybe one, honestly, a year. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3106.7200000000003s)]
*  But sports, if I'm watching, if I'm waiting, it might get ruined for me. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3108.28s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3111.84s)]
*  So I'll watch it live. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3112.84s)]
*  I'll talk to my friends. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3113.84s)]
*  And so networks will pay for it because advertisers are like, people aren't going to fast forward [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3114.84s)]
*  through these commercials. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3118.32s)]
*  They'll sit to watch it live. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3119.32s)]
*  But if Netflix throws crazy bags, it's done. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3120.32s)]
*  By the way, if you're going to throw some bread down, obviously you're going to do it [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3123.44s)]
*  with steak. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3127.48s)]
*  Well, we'll have a little talk about it a little bit later. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3129.0s)]
*  But anyway, we're going to watch the show. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3130.0s)]
*  I did a little bit of the show, I think it's called The Big Four. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3131.0s)]
*  And I was there, and I started playing it. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3132.0s)]
*  And I was playing it with the leader in global betting and US social casinos. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3133.0s)]
*  Bet on top sports and political events. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3134.0s)]
*  He used the promo code flagrant for your welcome bonus. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3135.0s)]
*  Real quick. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3136.94s)]
*  Shows, HBO might have one with The Dune Prophecy Show. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3137.94s)]
*  How do you think it's good? [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3144.2400000000002s)]
*  I've been watching it. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3145.2400000000002s)]
*  It's decent. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3146.2400000000002s)]
*  I think it's, I think that it's got two things going for them. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3147.2400000000002s)]
*  It's not as promoted as Penguin. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3149.92s)]
*  Penguin, I go into Penguin and I go, [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3153.08s)]
*  I've already seen 40 Instagram posts [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3156.68s)]
*  about how it's the highest rated episode on IMDb. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3158.84s)]
*  So I'm basically like, unfortunately, [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3161.0s)]
*  when my brain is wired, I'm looking to discredit. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3162.6s)]
*  Oh yeah, I'm seeing it. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3164.36s)]
*  High expectations kills it. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3165.16s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3166.44s)]
*  So Dune, I had nothing to watch, [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3167.16s)]
*  and I start watching it and like, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3169.08s)]
*  there's some line in the beginning that's like, [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3170.7599999999998s)]
*  and then women can figure out something, [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3172.6s)]
*  I'm like, oh my God, don't do this fucking like, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3174.12s)]
*  forced identity politics bullshit. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3176.92s)]
*  But the story's feeling Game of Thrones-y. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3179.72s)]
*  It's an interesting world. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3182.76s)]
*  They spend some money on the set design. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3184.76s)]
*  Like the sets look beautiful. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3186.84s)]
*  Like each literal world is drastically different. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3189.88s)]
*  Very cool. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3194.1200000000003s)]
*  They got good actors. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3195.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm 3 Epson. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3197.2400000000002s)]
*  I couldn't get through The Penguin. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3199.1600000000003s)]
*  I tried. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3201.7200000000003s)]
*  I could, just for whatever reason, I couldn't do it. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3202.76s)]
*  I know I'm wrong with The Penguin. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3204.92s)]
*  Everybody loves it. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3206.28s)]
*  But this shit, I think they might got one now. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3207.32s)]
*  Yeah, this is good. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3210.5200000000004s)]
*  I think they might got one. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3211.32s)]
*  Bro, I just found out about True Detective. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3212.92s)]
*  What the fuck is wrong with you guys? [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3215.48s)]
*  First season phenomenal. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3216.6000000000004s)]
*  Why didn't no one tell me? [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3217.6400000000003s)]
*  This shit isn't me. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3218.6000000000004s)]
*  After that, you know what? [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3219.7200000000003s)]
*  I watched the most recent one. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3221.32s)]
*  I liked it. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3222.36s)]
*  Really? [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3223.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it's good. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3223.48s)]
*  The sick place in Alaska. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3224.1200000000003s)]
*  Thematically, it's a little bit different. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3225.88s)]
*  Who's in it? [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3227.1600000000003s)]
*  Oh, the lesbian, the little lesbian. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3228.76s)]
*  Lesbian actress. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3233.5600000000004s)]
*  Little lesbian ass actress. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3235.4s)]
*  What's her name? [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3237.32s)]
*  Jodie Foster. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3238.0400000000004s)]
*  Oh, she's a lesbian? [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3239.0s)]
*  Yeah, she's lesbian. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3240.2000000000003s)]

*  Okay, let's just clarify some things. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3315.7999999999997s)]
*  There are people that are annoyed by this. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3317.4s)]
*  They're not annoyed that he did it. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3319.24s)]
*  I just want to point out. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3321.3199999999997s)]
*  Because anybody in this situation is going to use their power to protect their son. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3322.12s)]
*  Correct. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3328.44s)]
*  100% of the time. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3329.64s)]
*  It doesn't matter if... [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3330.7599999999998s)]
*  Would you pardon your child? [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3331.16s)]
*  Hells yes. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3332.52s)]
*  Hells yes. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3334.44s)]
*  Maybe not Akash dad, but... [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3335.56s)]
*  Son, you think your daddy would pardon you dead serious? [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3342.04s)]
*  You think your daddy would pardon you though? [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3345.48s)]
*  I mean that. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3347.96s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3348.44s)]
*  I think he would. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3349.24s)]
*  But he charged you like 10% of the money. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3350.44s)]
*  Yeah, there's a catch. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3352.2799999999997s)]
*  There's a catch for sure. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3354.04s)]
*  Yeah, he would not pardon my brother. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3355.08s)]
*  He would pardon me, but then he just would make sure I had a really shitty life after. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3357.4799999999996s)]
*  You wouldn't accept it. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3362.8399999999997s)]
*  You wouldn't accept to pardon him. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3364.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm going to stay right here. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3366.04s)]
*  Because I don't want to deal with this. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3367.24s)]
*  He's like, you ain't holding this over my head. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3368.52s)]
*  I'm getting butt fucked in this cell. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3371.0s)]
*  I think the thing that's annoying obviously is this idea that Democrats pretend that they're better than Republicans. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3375.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3380.9199999999996s)]
*  Once Democrats just be like, yo, we ain't shit. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3381.4799999999996s)]
*  And also, don't get me wrong. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3383.3999999999996s)]
*  Republicans also pretend that they're better. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3384.7599999999998s)]
*  Everybody has their own little grandstanding. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3387.2400000000002s)]
*  They just do it about different things. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3388.76s)]
*  I guess, yeah. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3389.88s)]
*  But Democrats are like, the Republicans won't respect the rule of law. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3390.5200000000004s)]
*  He's going to destroy it. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3395.32s)]
*  And I guess this isn't breaking the rule of law, but Hunter broke a law. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3396.6000000000004s)]
*  And then he's using a caveat to get him out. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3400.2000000000003s)]
*  But I think this is the annoyance of the Democrats. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3404.0400000000004s)]
*  It is the hypocrisy. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3405.88s)]
*  Hypocrisy is the theme of the episode today, Kendrick. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3410.36s)]
*  So, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3414.3599999999997s)]

*  I will tune in. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3423.0s)]
*  There might be some easter eggs in here. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3424.6s)]
*  There might be some different things. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3426.3599999999997s)]
*  He's a Patreon. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3427.7999999999997s)]
*  He is a Patreon subscriber. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3428.52s)]
*  Anywho, so I think that's the annoying thing. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3430.68s)]
*  Nobody disagrees with the action. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3433.48s)]
*  Correct. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3436.04s)]
*  Or at least they shouldn't. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3438.12s)]
*  It's a very small amount. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3438.9199999999996s)]
*  What did he do even? [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3441.0s)]
*  He hardened his son. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3443.16s)]
*  No, what did Hunter even do? [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3444.9199999999996s)]
*  Getting his dick sunk with a Glock in his hand? [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3446.52s)]
*  That's a crime in America? [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3447.64s)]
*  What the hell happened? [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3449.24s)]
*  He looks like the American you can be. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3450.12s)]
*  But what is he, like, what has he hemmed, jammed up for? [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3451.3199999999997s)]
*  Who got his in? [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3454.68s)]
*  He didn't fill out a gun form correctly. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3455.48s)]
*  He lied on it. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3459.08s)]
*  This is America. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3459.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3460.3599999999997s)]
*  I think he said he'd never been convicted of a crime or something like that. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3460.8399999999997s)]
*  Right? [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3463.3999999999996s)]
*  He might have forgot. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3463.8799999999997s)]
*  He was off the drugs. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3464.9199999999996s)]

*  Rules for the and not for me. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3557.56s)]
*  This is a glaring example of it. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3559.56s)]
*  Republicans, you allowed to have some fun and dance on this one as much as you want. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3561.24s)]
*  And Democrats, you got to eat it. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3564.52s)]
*  Simple as that. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3565.72s)]
*  I think Biden said that shit because he was going to run again. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3566.52s)]

*  And then after I'm about to, I think he had planned the entire time he was going to pardon us. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3572.84s)]
*  Of course. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3575.96s)]

*  They gave syphilis to the pilots? [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3766.36s)]
*  Why would they give it to the pilots? [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3770.92s)]
*  They wanna see at altitude if they would have syphilis. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3773.0s)]
*  Because they had the red tails down there. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3776.12s)]
*  So what was the experiment? [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3779.24s)]
*  It was done by the Germans. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3781.64s)]
*  They had the greatest pilot that America ever had. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3782.44s)]
*  They didn't lose one bomber in World War II. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3785.4s)]
*  There's an American public school system right here, people. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3787.24s)]
*  The red tails had the greatest flying record in American war history. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3790.4399999999996s)]
*  They didn't lose one bomber. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3795.8799999999997s)]
*  There was white racists that were like, I'm not flying unless them black people [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3798.12s)]
*  jump in the air with the planes on their backs and protect this bomber. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3802.9199999999996s)]
*  They were like, I don't think they can fly, but them motherfuckers can jump. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3809.24s)]
*  And then they were giving them syphilis as well? [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3813.9599999999996s)]
*  Or there are different black people at the base that they were giving syphilis to? [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3815.64s)]
*  So hold on. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3820.3599999999997s)]
*  How many were there? [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3826.4399999999996s)]
*  There's a whole black army down there? [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3827.0s)]
*  So there was a syphilis black unit and then there were red tails? [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3829.3999999999996s)]
*  They were not military, these syphilis guys. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3833.72s)]
*  What? [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3835.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, no, they were just regular sheriff. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3836.9199999999996s)]
*  Oh my God, they should have been in the military. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3839.0s)]
*  They would have completely avoided this. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3841.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't know about that. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3843.48s)]
*  I think they were just sheriff croppers down there. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3847.08s)]
*  They were doing their thing and they were like, oh, we're going to do an experiment. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3848.52s)]
*  We're going to give you some vaccines and stuff. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3850.68s)]
*  They weren't sheriff cropping still in 1942. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3852.12s)]
*  No, I think it was like some shit like that. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=3855.32s)]

*  All right, guys, let's take a break for a second, [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4313.96s)]
*  because y'all need to know how we're doing with our gambling. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4315.24s)]
*  By gambling, I mean cryptocurrency. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4319.5599999999995s)]
*  Now, we are doing it with Kraken, which I think Forbes said was the number one. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4321.8s)]
*  Was it the number one that Forbes said? [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4327.8s)]
*  Number one? [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4330.92s)]
*  Yeah, security-wise, that's their first. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4332.04s)]
*  They're focused, and that's why this is what you want with this shit. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4334.12s)]
*  And this is why we're just picking random letters that mean nothing. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4337.0s)]
*  It's not like they give you more money. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4339.24s)]
*  Yeah, we just need to make sure the money is going to be there. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4340.5199999999995s)]
*  I can tell you personally, having put money in two exchanges that folded, [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4342.5199999999995s)]
*  there's no FDIC. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4346.04s)]
*  Like if your bank closes, your money is insured up to $100,000, [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4347.32s)]
*  they don't have that with crypto. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4350.28s)]
*  So I'm asked out. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4351.88s)]
*  But if I just put my money in Kraken from the beginning, [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4353.48s)]
*  I'd have been Kraken. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4356.36s)]
*  So we all put some money in Kraken from the beginning. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4357.08s)]
*  Listen, I don't want to talk about... [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4360.76s)]
*  I'll tell you where I put my money, but I am not... [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4364.2s)]
*  Remember, remember, Coffeezilla, our boy, we love you, and we would never go against you. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4366.36s)]
*  I don't even feel comfortable saying where I put my money in. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4374.6s)]
*  I tell you, because I'm down. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4377.4800000000005s)]
*  It seems like I'm endorsing it. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4378.76s)]
*  I don't. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4380.52s)]
*  So I'm not even going to say, but we did it on some of them, [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4381.32s)]
*  and they're all there at Kraken. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4385.08s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4387.08s)]
*  And if you want to do it, you should do it at Kraken. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4388.12s)]
*  Let me tell you why. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4390.36s)]
*  Because they're still around. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4391.24s)]
*  But how did you pick? [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4392.44s)]
*  Can you tell how your rationale for picking? [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4393.24s)]
*  Favorite letters. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4395.5599999999995s)]
*  Also memes. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4397.799999999999s)]
*  I got some memes going. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4398.679999999999s)]
*  One sounded like it had a vibrancy to it. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4400.28s)]
*  Whichever icons look the coolest. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4405.16s)]
*  Icons, you can go off icons. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4406.919999999999s)]
*  That's the beauty of crypto, is that there's no intelligence required. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4408.2s)]
*  Because you're just guessing letters that mean nothing. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4411.879999999999s)]
*  So Al's four is insane. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4415.400000000001s)]

*  He shoots it and there's a lot of [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4802.44s)]
*  dancing choreography that feel like a musical. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4804.12s)]
*  But it's clearly a film, right? [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4808.36s)]
*  I don't know if I'm describing this right. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4813.24s)]
*  He could shoot it just as a film [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4816.36s)]
*  and there is no musical aspect [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4818.28s)]
*  where the whole town kind of [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4820.04s)]
*  jumps into dance and story [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4821.4s)]
*  and they all kind of connect together. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4822.92s)]
*  You could just take the narrative seriously [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4825.0s)]
*  and run with that. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4826.6s)]
*  But he incorporates what you would imagine [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4827.72s)]
*  the play is, I thought very well, [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4830.12s)]
*  without it being too forced. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4831.56s)]
*  So I thought that that was a really [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4833.4800000000005s)]
*  and kind of cool camera stuff. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4835.24s)]
*  He almost feels like everything is on a drone. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4837.0s)]
*  Did you watch it? [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4838.84s)]
*  The cameras are... [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4840.52s)]
*  I need to see the rigging for it [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4841.88s)]
*  because the cameras are moving through the world [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4843.4800000000005s)]
*  and moving through all the people dancing. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4846.2s)]
*  So I don't know if they're on [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4847.88s)]
*  like a kind of train track set type of thing. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4849.4800000000005s)]
*  Or if it's from the ceiling. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4853.4800000000005s)]
*  It could be a cable cam, it could be that, [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4855.4800000000005s)]
*  it could be an FPV drone. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4856.92s)]
*  It's cool. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4859.4800000000005s)]
*  He did In the Heights. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4860.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh, so he's used to doing this. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4862.6s)]
*  He knows this. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4864.6s)]
*  He came from... [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4864.92s)]
*  After Step Up, he did like [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4867.080000000001s)]
*  Bieber's Never Say Never, his big music. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4868.68s)]
*  I think he directed Ronnie Chang's special. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4870.6s)]
*  I think he did Ali Wong's special also. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4873.72s)]
*  No, wow. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4875.72s)]
*  I don't see that at all. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4876.360000000001s)]
*  He did Ali Wong's special. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4877.240000000001s)]
*  There's a Hello Kitty campaign. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4878.76s)]
*  He did do Ken Jeong's You Complete Me Ho. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4881.4800000000005s)]
*  He did that. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4884.360000000001s)]
*  He did that one. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4885.080000000001s)]
*  That is true. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4885.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4886.68s)]
*  And he also did Thai Cave Rescue as an example. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4888.6s)]
*  Everybody has to start somewhere. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4894.360000000001s)]
*  You gotta start it somewhere, man. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4895.4800000000005s)]
*  That is actually true. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4897.56s)]
*  Wow. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4899.96s)]
*  I think also though, [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4900.92s)]
*  we didn't understand how big this play was [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4901.8s)]
*  when it came out. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4903.96s)]
*  God damn. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4904.6s)]
*  People were into this. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4905.64s)]
*  I watched it like a year ago. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4906.52s)]
*  I went in with super low expectations. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4908.52s)]
*  You watched it live? [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4910.04s)]
*  I watched a Broadway play. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4910.68s)]
*  It was like a date night. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4912.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4913.56s)]
*  And let me tell you something. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4914.5199999999995s)]
*  The play is fire. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4916.92s)]
*  The play is fantastic. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4917.88s)]
*  You've seen the play, too? [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4918.84s)]
*  Hell yeah, I've seen it twice. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4919.72s)]
*  That shit is incredible. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4924.04s)]
*  I'm so bad at using anything. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4928.2s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4929.64s)]
*  That shit is incredible. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4930.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't give a fuck. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4932.04s)]
*  I didn't think it was gonna be whack. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4933.0s)]
*  I'm doing this for my wife. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4934.84s)]
*  And I was like, this is the best. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4936.12s)]
*  It's incredible, son. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4938.12s)]
*  Oh, come on, man. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4940.2s)]
*  It's a musical. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4941.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4942.12s)]
*  All right, go on. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4942.68s)]
*  I saw Hamilton. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4943.32s)]
*  I saw Book of Mormon. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4944.2s)]
*  I saw Wicked. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4945.08s)]
*  I had the lowest expectations for Wicked, [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4945.88s)]
*  but I thought it was the best one of the three. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4947.56s)]
*  Those are the three plays I've seen. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4949.32s)]
*  Nah, Hamilton is better. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4950.76s)]
*  But do you guys want to say what the storyline is? [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4951.72s)]
*  It's kind of like they created a prequel to The Wizard of Oz. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4955.48s)]
*  And it's about how the witch becomes the Wicked witch or whatever. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4959.56s)]
*  And they basically, I'm curious how they got the rights to this. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4963.0s)]
*  Apparently, there was a lot of fan fiction written about this, [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4968.4400000000005s)]
*  but then someone wrote a book. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4970.84s)]
*  But this completely changes The Wizard of Oz. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4972.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4976.52s)]
*  So if I'm the person who wrote The Wizard of Oz, [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4977.080000000001s)]
*  I'm not gonna let a motherfucker write another movie that is before [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4979.72s)]
*  that completely changes the entire meaning of my life's greatest work. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4983.080000000001s)]
*  Rewrite the Bible and you're like, Satan's misunderstood. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4987.96s)]
*  You're like, what has changed the Bible? [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4990.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4991.56s)]
*  They wrote a sequel to the Bible. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4992.280000000001s)]
*  That shit goes way harder. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4993.4800000000005s)]
*  Sequel? [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4994.52s)]
*  Sequel exists based on the information that you laid down. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=4994.92s)]
*  The book is public domain. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5001.72s)]
*  That's why, because it was so many, it was like 100 years ago or whatever. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5003.64s)]
*  1900. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5006.12s)]
*  And then Gregory Meagher wrote the book Wicked. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5006.68s)]
*  The movie is not. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5009.72s)]
*  The book is. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5010.36s)]
*  So we could do our own fan fiction of the book. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5011.4800000000005s)]
*  We could make another version of Wicked. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5014.28s)]
*  A Wicked. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5016.28s)]
*  Sort of. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5019.0s)]
*  Wait, what do you mean? [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5019.88s)]
*  It's not public domain. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5020.68s)]
*  No, no, no, we could do a prequel. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5022.36s)]
*  Another Wizard of Oz. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5023.64s)]
*  Another prequel, but instead of Wicked, it's just a little different. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5025.56s)]
*  It's about Mark's grandma. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5027.96s)]
*  It's called Dicking. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5028.84s)]
*  She was just misunderstood. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5033.64s)]
*  I want to be popular. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5034.76s)]
*  She was a war. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5038.4400000000005s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5039.320000000001s)]
*  She was not riding a broomstick in this one. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5039.96s)]
*  All right. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5044.04s)]
*  So that was Fire. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5045.0s)]
*  I saw Gladiator 2. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5047.64s)]
*  Oh, you saw that? [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5049.0s)]
*  I saw Wicked twice. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5050.360000000001s)]
*  What? [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5052.360000000001s)]
*  My wife wanted to go a second time. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5053.320000000001s)]
*  My nephew wanted to go. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5054.68s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5055.8s)]
*  Now that's gay as fuck. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5056.6s)]
*  Six hours of Wicked. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5057.64s)]
*  It was still Fire. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5059.240000000001s)]
*  Six hours of Wicked. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5062.68s)]
*  I didn't want to go. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5064.04s)]
*  Second time I was still, I was like, it's still good. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5065.240000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5068.120000000001s)]
*  Twice to play twice the movie. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5069.4800000000005s)]
*  No, once to play. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5071.08s)]
*  Okay. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5073.400000000001s)]

*  And tons of other people I'm just not even thinking about right now. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5345.08s)]
*  So thank you guys so much for being there. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5347.24s)]
*  And it was really cool, especially with everything that happened with the venue [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5349.5599999999995s)]
*  and the city just still coming out and supporting me on Thanksgiving weekend. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5352.36s)]
*  And that just felt great. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5356.12s)]
*  Just felt really cool. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5359.48s)]
*  It felt, now is the hard part. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5360.28s)]
*  Now we've got to get into the edit, obviously. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5361.4s)]
*  But and just filming a special is just so interesting, like of this size. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5363.5599999999995s)]
*  You know, we've only done things that we've done ourselves before. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5368.36s)]
*  And this is the first time where we're like, OK, we're stepping it up. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5371.32s)]
*  So in order to step it up, you have to hire companies. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5374.92s)]
*  Why do you have to hire companies? [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5377.32s)]
*  Because there's all this minutia that we don't worry about when we're filming a show together. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5378.36s)]
*  We're throwing up some cameras. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5383.719999999999s)]
*  We're like, all right, we're going to go and edit together. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5384.92s)]
*  When you're doing something of this size, it's like, OK, we need to make sure we have [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5386.92s)]
*  releases for everybody that could be on camera. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5390.36s)]
*  We need to make sure that we have the union signatory signed off and the scheduling and [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5392.6s)]
*  timesheet. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5395.96s)]
*  So you basically you're hiring out these different companies. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5396.4400000000005s)]
*  I thought an interesting thing that happens when you're filming it is [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5399.88s)]
*  you have to be super diligent about what you want and your vision, because each [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5403.8s)]
*  department that is working on it. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5411.160000000001s)]
*  The interests aren't exactly aligned. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5415.240000000001s)]
*  Obviously, everybody wants there to be a great special. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5419.56s)]
*  Right. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5421.56s)]
*  And we have, like, for example, we have the best audio guy in the business, Thomas [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5422.04s)]
*  Casettas, the best audio guy in the business hands down. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5424.76s)]
*  It's not even close. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5427.64s)]
*  And Thomas is telling me certain things that will protect his audio for me. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5430.28s)]
*  He wants me to have the cleanest audio. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5435.32s)]
*  It's like if we mic you too much, then you could be higher mic than the crowd. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5437.16s)]
*  And we want to make sure that that mix sounds good. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5441.88s)]
*  But if we mic me too little, then I won't have enough control of the crap. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5444.28s)]
*  You know, so he's trying to protect the best version of his audio. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5447.8s)]
*  Thank God we have someone who understands what we want as well. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5450.52s)]
*  But I can imagine someone who doesn't know stand up, who's just recording a special, [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5453.0s)]
*  is going, oh, no, we got to keep the mic down because it's going to fuck up my audio. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5456.92s)]
*  Not realizing what the crowd needs. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5460.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5462.76s)]
*  The crowd needs you to fucking hit them in the chest. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5463.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5465.72s)]
*  Same with video. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5466.84s)]
*  Video wants it to look beautiful. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5468.52s)]
*  You know, one thing I think that a lot of times people make mistakes for in a special, [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5471.4800000000005s)]
*  they'll do what's called a line cut. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5475.8s)]
*  I don't know if this makes any sense, but essentially they're doing a live [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5477.96s)]
*  edit of the special. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5480.44s)]
*  Trying to edit stand up live is like catching a fart with chopsticks. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5481.879999999999s)]
*  It's not even possible. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5486.04s)]
*  Because you would have to be so fluent in the comedian's material and timing [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5488.28s)]
*  in order to build tension, build tension, then release it. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5494.839999999999s)]
*  With comedy, it's not like music where you can just cut through a bunch of different [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5498.599999999999s)]
*  angles and make it look epic. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5502.04s)]
*  When you do that, you distract. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5503.5599999999995s)]
*  It's kind of like horror where you got to like build, push in, push in, build, build, [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5505.24s)]
*  and punchline release. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5509.72s)]
*  If you don't know exactly when I'm going to release, you're fucked. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5511.64s)]
*  So it's like, but in their mind, they're like, okay, let me make this shot look really cool. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5514.52s)]
*  Let me make it look so beautiful so I can offer value to this project. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5519.0s)]
*  Everybody wants to offer value, but sometimes they're offering value [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5522.52s)]
*  isn't what's going to be best for the project. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5526.04s)]
*  So you need to go in. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5528.68s)]
*  Thank God I have the fucking ride or die best team on the fucking planet who are like, [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5531.0s)]
*  this is what we need and we need you guys to understand this is what's going to make [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5535.32s)]
*  the project the best and just articulating that and really fucking dialing it in. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5540.2s)]
*  It's just an interesting thing. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5545.0s)]
*  I think that like, especially comedians, if they're listening to should be really, [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5545.96s)]
*  you should be really connected to your project. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5549.5599999999995s)]
*  Don't just go out there and film it and think it's going to be okay because it won't [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5552.84s)]
*  because most people don't understand stand up. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5557.08s)]
*  Even if they've done specials, they just don't understand what makes it good. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5559.88s)]
*  And I think you get into these situations where you're with these people who have done [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5563.72s)]
*  tons of specials and at first there's like a little bit of you're a little differential to them. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5567.72s)]
*  And then we had kind of had a moment where just like, hold on, hold on. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5572.68s)]
*  Yeah, we posted things on YouTube and Instagram, but we saw that Madison Square Garden twice, [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5576.28s)]
*  selling posts, posting things on YouTube and Instagram. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5581.72s)]
*  We clearly know what we're doing. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5583.8s)]
*  I don't know if there's anybody else who sold out the garden without having a network special. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5585.48s)]
*  So it's like, I'm not going to belittle what we did because the platform was YouTube. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5589.639999999999s)]
*  Clearly we know what we're doing. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5593.4s)]
*  And it was cool to have that team together where we're like, this is what we want. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5595.16s)]
*  We're all down. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5601.24s)]
*  All right, guys, I know you think you guys know what you want. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5602.28s)]
*  This is what we need. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5605.8s)]
*  Trust us. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5607.16s)]
*  And it was even cool to go from Friday to Saturday. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5608.6s)]
*  We made our adjustments from Friday to Saturday and just to see it become our show by Saturday. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5612.12s)]
*  You just introduced so many other creatives. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5620.44s)]
*  Stuart shows on the road, it's just like you are the single creative vision if you're a comic doing [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5623.16s)]
*  that. But then as soon as you're filming, it's like, okay, we're introducing wardrobe creative, [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5627.24s)]
*  and that might be different than how it normally is. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5631.96s)]
*  And then the visual creative, the sound creative, there's tons of other creative [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5633.5599999999995s)]
*  they get brought in and they are all fighting for their personal agenda to be fulfilled. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5637.719999999999s)]
*  And they're all also talented in their own right and successful. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5642.12s)]
*  And I like to look at them thinking altruistically, they want it to be the best [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5645.799999999999s)]
*  and they trust their talent to make it the best. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5650.36s)]
*  So it's managing that. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5653.08s)]
*  Hey, I know that you think that this is what's best for it. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5654.759999999999s)]
*  We think this is what's best for it. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5658.36s)]
*  And let me die on my sword. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5659.719999999999s)]
*  Because there's one thing I cannot live with. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5662.5199999999995s)]
*  It's your decision being wrong. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5665.0s)]
*  Yeah, I can live with mine. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5667.24s)]
*  You know, but I'm not going to live with yours when I told you I want something else. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5669.639999999999s)]
*  And I just thought it was so fine. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5674.5199999999995s)]
*  There's this great moment like Friday and even going into Saturday, [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5676.84s)]
*  we're just like, our internal team, like our fucking people, [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5680.360000000001s)]
*  everybody was just on the same page. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5685.56s)]
*  It was just like, this is what needs to be done. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5687.08s)]
*  And you were there Friday and you were there Saturday. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5689.320000000001s)]
*  And I saw the difference. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5691.0s)]
*  And it was like, everybody just stepped up. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5691.96s)]
*  Voices got loud. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5694.2s)]
*  Everybody got stern. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5695.64s)]
*  And I think everybody started to realize like, [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5696.92s)]
*  oh, these aren't like a ragtag group. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5700.04s)]
*  They know what the fuck they want. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5702.52s)]
*  And I felt really grateful. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5704.76s)]
*  I'll stop talking about it, but I felt very grateful [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5708.6s)]
*  to have all you guys there to back up that vision. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5711.88s)]
*  And it gave me a lot of confidence. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5714.92s)]
*  And yeah, I just want to say thank you. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5717.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5719.4s)]
*  I also think you've empowered your team throughout. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5720.04s)]
*  I trust you guys implicitly. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5724.44s)]
*  I was just like, I was like, yo, Shifty, Mark, get what you need. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5726.12s)]
*  And then they got what they needed, bro. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5731.56s)]
*  It was just... [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5734.04s)]
*  All of it looked beautiful, but I'm not confirming what you're saying. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5735.320000000001s)]
*  But no, it was exciting. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5739.240000000001s)]
*  It looked great. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5741.0s)]
*  I've got a shit ton of cameras, dude. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5742.76s)]
*  It's going to be a fun edit. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5744.6s)]
*  You know what's so funny? [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5747.16s)]
*  I went to the video village. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5747.96s)]
*  I was like, yeah. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5749.08s)]
*  Oh yeah, I was like, there's so many. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5749.96s)]
*  Command center in Asda. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5751.72s)]
*  And you know what's interesting is [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5754.12s)]
*  they have these things called RoboCams, right? [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5755.96s)]
*  I saw the fire. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5758.52s)]
*  So this is fascinating. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5760.04s)]
*  RoboCams like automatic cameras. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5762.6s)]
*  We've seen them on the road in certain venues. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5764.6s)]
*  They just kind of look and move like a security cam footage. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5766.4400000000005s)]
*  This was the newest version of these RoboCams. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5771.56s)]
*  We only had two up. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5773.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't know if I'm ever going to film a special with that. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5775.320000000001s)]
*  They're a little cylinder. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5778.200000000001s)]
*  They could be anywhere in the room. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5780.04s)]
*  And you don't even notice what they are, but the movement now digitally, [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5783.160000000001s)]
*  oh, it's like it is the push ins are better than somebody racking focus pushing it. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5788.52s)]
*  The movement on them. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5796.76s)]
*  And now you don't have 14 different people. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5798.12s)]
*  Not only do they move, not only move up and down, [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5801.0s)]
*  they're pushing like they're moving on different axes, [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5804.12s)]
*  only taking up a fraction of the space. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5806.76s)]
*  I saw one on the side of the stage is going up and down. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5809.4s)]
*  And she was like, oh, that's going to be nice. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5812.36s)]
*  Like you said, three axes, same time, just like. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5815.0s)]
*  What is it called? [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5817.4s)]
*  The acronym is like P something T camera. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5818.04s)]
*  P T Z. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5820.679999999999s)]
*  P T Z. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5821.799999999999s)]
*  P T Z. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5822.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5823.639999999999s)]
*  And not just like the high end version. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5824.36s)]
*  It was funny. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5827.48s)]
*  Like looking into that for the studio. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5827.96s)]
*  I was like, oh, those are the price. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5829.16s)]
*  You don't even have to be in the room. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5830.5199999999995s)]
*  I price it out for editing them. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5831.719999999999s)]
*  Expensive. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5833.32s)]
*  They're really expensive. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5834.5199999999995s)]
*  But prices will come down eventually what happens. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5835.24s)]
*  But like a perfect example is like, I told them this is my note always when we're going [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5838.12s)]
*  to do like a live show. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5842.36s)]
*  I even tell Shifty, I go, nobody should see a camera. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5843.32s)]
*  If people see a camera, they get nervous. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5846.12s)]
*  They're like afraid to just react and just thinking about themselves. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5849.24s)]
*  And the best comedy show is people get to leave themselves. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5853.48s)]
*  And the first show, all of a sudden I'm up there and there's this camera almost called [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5857.72s)]
*  a gimbal, meaning it basically, but you guys know this, but I'm just describing people [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5863.08s)]
*  at home, like it balances the camera perfectly so someone could walk with it. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5866.12s)]
*  So it's not holding it on a shoulder. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5869.48s)]
*  It's this mechanism that perfectly balances it. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5871.0s)]
*  He starts walking down the aisle. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5873.4s)]
*  I think he's going to get one shot and then leave. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5875.0s)]
*  He's walking on an aisle for like 15 minutes. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5877.08s)]
*  I just stopped the show and I go, you need to get the fuck out of here. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5879.08s)]
*  That shit was so fun. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5883.8s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5885.48s)]
*  Because then you went right back into it and got a laugh immediately. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5885.72s)]
*  Yeah, that was fun. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5889.4s)]
*  But it's like to have the crowd on a yo-yo like that is fucking. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5890.44s)]
*  I mean, yo, shout out the crowd. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5893.72s)]
*  But like also it's like to me, I'm going, you're making me feel fake. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5895.64s)]
*  If I don't acknowledge that camera, it's like a girl with huge tits walking down the aisle. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5900.2s)]
*  I can't not say something about that. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5905.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5909.08s)]
*  Can you get up here immediately? [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5911.32s)]
*  Yeah, you stay exactly where you are. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5914.76s)]
*  But so it's just one of those things where it's like, and this is like the video team [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5916.92s)]
*  was pitching me all these cameras that would like come backstage and point out backstage. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5922.84s)]
*  I go, guys, the second the audience sees a camera stick out backstage, [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5927.16s)]
*  they're going to be petrified. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5932.52s)]
*  Now, would it look cool? [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5934.44s)]
*  Sure. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5935.719999999999s)]
*  Has anything been funnier because it looked cool in the history of comedy? [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5936.36s)]
*  No. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5940.04s)]
*  You know what's funny? [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5940.28s)]
*  Chris Rock's bigger and blacker when the cameras are literally shaking [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5941.16s)]
*  because they're on sticks and the ground is moving. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5944.839999999999s)]
*  That to me, the grittiness of that is just beautiful. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5948.04s)]
*  I go, guys, I don't want anybody to see a camera. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5950.839999999999s)]
*  To capture the fucking show, make them believe it's just a regular show. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5954.599999999999s)]
*  You know, and I think that is like the number one most important thing. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5959.64s)]
*  The most important thing you can do is make it look like this is just a regular show. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5965.400000000001s)]
*  Honestly, I wouldn't have even announced Netflix taping [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5969.72s)]
*  if we didn't have all the issues with the venue and all that other stuff. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5972.12s)]
*  I was just like, hey, we're just here's some shows. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5974.92s)]
*  Come on out. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5976.92s)]
*  But because you want to capture that kind of authenticity. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5978.28s)]
*  And I hate being a fake on stage. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5981.4800000000005s)]
*  And having cameras walk in and me not see them or something popping behind me [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5985.320000000001s)]
*  makes me feel like I'm fake to you because you know that you see it. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5988.68s)]
*  I know I see it, but we're both pretending it's not there. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5992.76s)]
*  Just cool things to learn. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5997.240000000001s)]
*  And maybe if anybody's watching that's into comedy or producing comedy, [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=5998.4400000000005s)]
*  they can take something from it. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6001.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's fire. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6002.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm sorry I couldn't be there. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6004.040000000001s)]
*  Stop, stop. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6005.240000000001s)]
*  You will keep apologizing, bro. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6006.040000000001s)]
*  Come on. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6007.240000000001s)]
*  Dude, I asked my mom, who loves you, by the way. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6007.56s)]
*  She's she reached out, by the way, and she said congratulations. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6010.6s)]
*  She loves you. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6014.04s)]
*  I told her I love her. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6014.52s)]
*  I said I can leave a day early. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6015.4800000000005s)]
*  Andrew's taping a special and then she goes stay an extra day. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6017.400000000001s)]
*  I don't spend enough time with you. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6019.72s)]
*  And I was like, all right, well, fuck. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6020.68s)]
*  I'm here. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6022.76s)]
*  But I saw it at MSG. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6023.400000000001s)]
*  It was and you know, I'm a huge anybody, everybody knows I'm a huge fan of you. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6026.4400000000005s)]
*  It was your best work by a mile. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6029.72s)]
*  And that is like it was awesome. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6032.200000000001s)]
*  It was so fucking awesome. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6034.200000000001s)]
*  And I heard it's gotten even better and I'm so excited to see it. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6035.56s)]
*  Obviously the team, you guys all fucking kill it. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6037.88s)]
*  I'm so excited to see it. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6040.04s)]
*  I'm excited for people. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6041.400000000001s)]
*  Do you know when people can see it? [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6042.2s)]
*  Or do you even want to float that? [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6043.32s)]
*  Or are we keeping it in the top? [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6045.4s)]
*  We have a date that we're kind of locking in, but I want to get through. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6046.36s)]
*  Yeah, don't announce nothing. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6050.04s)]
*  The fucking worst thing you can do. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6051.96s)]
*  Black History Month. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6055.24s)]
*  No, but yeah, I think it will be really fun. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6058.44s)]
*  I'm just very grateful for the team, very grateful to everybody who came out. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6061.8s)]
*  And there's this feeling that there are people there who probably [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6065.16s)]
*  been at my first fucking show I did at Gotham. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6067.48s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6070.5199999999995s)]
*  They were at that. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6071.16s)]
*  And there's a feeling like so much in comedy, the beginning years, [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6072.12s)]
*  are you winning over people who are skeptical of you. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6076.44s)]
*  You're doing a bar show and they're like, how did I even end up here? [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6079.4s)]
*  And this is people going, hey, I've been fucking with you for 10 years. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6082.92s)]
*  I want you to fucking rock this tonight. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6086.84s)]
*  And that is an awesome feeling that I hope all of you guys get and other comics get too. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6089.16s)]
*  That is pretty cool. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6095.16s)]
*  Anyway, thank you. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6097.4s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6098.5199999999995s)]
*  Thanks Thanksgiving. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6099.48s)]
*  Tell me. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6100.5199999999995s)]
*  Best Thanksgiving I've had in decades. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6101.400000000001s)]
*  My wife and I went home and it was going to be a little comfortable [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6104.52s)]
*  because I haven't really talked to my dad in like nine months. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6108.28s)]
*  Wow. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6111.08s)]
*  Yeah, I talked to my mom about that. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6111.72s)]
*  My wife is like, just the whole vibe is different. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6113.72s)]
*  You've been so happy recently. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6116.04s)]
*  You've been sleeping better. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6118.76s)]
*  Hilarious. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6120.52s)]
*  I mean, you've never sold more tickets. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6121.16s)]
*  Your life has been fucking good. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6123.96s)]
*  It's really unbelievable. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6124.92s)]
*  So I tell my mom, my voice is concerned. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6126.6s)]
*  My mom goes to my dad apparently and goes, all right, here's the options. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6129.64s)]
*  You either apologize to your sons for everything you've done [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6133.32s)]
*  or you're not here for Thanksgiving. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6136.76s)]
*  Oh shit. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6138.4400000000005s)]
*  My dad bought a ticket to India. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6140.68s)]
*  It was awesome. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6150.12s)]
*  We had such a happy time, dude. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6152.04s)]
*  My mom moved into a new house. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6154.12s)]
*  I'm blessed enough. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6155.96s)]
*  Thank you God to be able to take care of the mortgage on it. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6157.0s)]
*  She took care of a big down payment, but she's built this house with us in mind. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6159.0s)]
*  She's like, I want you guys to come here whenever. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6164.28s)]

*  A month in India is probably a couple thousand dollars at least. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6267.16s)]
*  And normally I'm paying for the ticket. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6269.719999999999s)]

*  That's not important to them at all. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6701.240000000001s)]
*  The only thing that matters is you're there for them. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6703.16s)]
*  And it was like a cool moment, like a cool dad moment where it was like, [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6705.88s)]
*  am I really going to go do this special about how much I want to have a baby and all the trials [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6710.52s)]
*  and tribulations that it took for us to get this baby and then abandon my baby the night before? [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6714.360000000001s)]
*  You know, I make things bigger than they actually are. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6720.68s)]
*  It's just my kids teething and this just happened to be the night before the special. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6723.0s)]
*  But in my head, I was like, this is one of those moments where [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6726.12s)]
*  you decide what's more important. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6729.4800000000005s)]
*  Is it more important that I get a little more sleep so that I'm rested or is it more important [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6731.320000000001s)]
*  that I'm like there for the baby? [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6734.92s)]
*  And so I just gave Emma the baby. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6736.84s)]
*  So I fucking got her down and it was like, [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6741.32s)]
*  and she woke up a few hours later and Emma, you know, took care of it. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6743.4800000000005s)]
*  But it was a cool like reminder that none of this stuff matters to them. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6747.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6751.96s)]
*  And we got to be aware of that 100%. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6752.4400000000005s)]
*  That they're the most important thing and everything else is no longer priority, [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6756.52s)]
*  no matter how fucking big it is. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6762.12s)]
*  And I'm grateful that that even presented itself on a night of that importance. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6764.2s)]
*  And I made what I think was the right decision, which is fucking lock in. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6770.12s)]
*  That's beautiful. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6773.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it was cool. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6774.28s)]
*  Shout out to Shelton. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6776.28s)]
*  I got a little funny story from Thanksgiving. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6777.08s)]
*  So Thanksgiving, I did it with my dad and then on the weekend, I did it with my mom. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6778.679999999999s)]
*  But on Thursday, so I go to my dad's place, he don't catch him up on the air, just like, [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6782.839999999999s)]
*  hey, you know, studios are going well, all this stuff. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6787.639999999999s)]
*  He's super proud of me. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6789.639999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, let me get the good stuff out now. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6791.0s)]
*  And so I come, I show him the Cybertruck. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6792.84s)]
*  He's like blown away. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6794.92s)]
*  He's like, this is from the future. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6796.2s)]
*  All this good stuff. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6797.32s)]
*  And then I sit him down as I'm looking at Obama here and Martin Luther King picture here. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6798.6s)]
*  And then I'm like, dad, I did an episode with Trump. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6804.2s)]
*  Bro, he almost kicked me out of Thanksgiving. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6809.88s)]
*  No way. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6811.64s)]
*  He was pissed? [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6813.08s)]
*  No, he was like laughing about it. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6813.72s)]
*  But yeah, he wasn't that funny. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6815.96s)]
*  It was really funny. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6817.72s)]
*  I knew I had to get the good stuff out first. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6819.64s)]
*  That's funny that you guys are, you guys, your relationship is good and building. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6822.2s)]
*  No, we are good. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6825.32s)]
*  It's just like, I'd be busy, he'd be busy. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6826.2s)]
*  For sure. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6828.28s)]
*  We all are. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6829.08s)]
*  But he pardoned you. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6830.04s)]
*  Did he have any questions about it? [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6833.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he was just like, how is he in person? [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6836.04s)]
*  And I'm like, you know, he's how you used to think about him years ago. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6837.719999999999s)]
*  Just that guy. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6842.36s)]
*  He's a New Yorker. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6843.639999999999s)]
*  It must be crazy for our parents to see these things. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6846.36s)]
*  Like to see us sit down with a president. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6850.6s)]
*  I'm trying to wrap my head around that. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6854.76s)]
*  One of my cousins goes, that was real? [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6857.0s)]
*  I was like, you think I made that up? [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6859.08s)]
*  I'm not even a fucking loser. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6860.68s)]
*  Do you think I am? [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6862.04s)]
*  But that is like, you want your kid to do well. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6863.88s)]
*  You want your kid to succeed. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6866.52s)]
*  You have all these hopes and you want them to have friends. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6869.0s)]
*  And then they interview the president of the United States of America. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6872.84s)]
*  There's got to be a little moment of extreme pride. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6878.92s)]
*  Regardless of the politics, you're like, whoa, I made that thing. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6881.88s)]
*  They're talking to the president. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6887.32s)]
*  Driving a fucking future car. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6888.92s)]
*  Oh, that's wild. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6892.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's cool. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6893.64s)]
*  I'm even thinking about that with my kid. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6894.28s)]
*  I'm like, thinking about the fact that he's going to do things in life blows my mind. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6895.4s)]
*  It's hard to wrap my head. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6900.68s)]
*  Like, is he going to have a job? [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6901.96s)]
*  Because you just see him as such a baby right now? [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6902.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, you're going to do stuff? [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6904.28s)]
*  You're going to impress me? [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6906.12s)]
*  He's already doing it on a little scale. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6910.04s)]
*  As an adult human, he's going to do stuff. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6911.48s)]
*  Which is crazy. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6913.64s)]
*  Do you ever think about when they'll know how much you love them? [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6914.28s)]
*  No. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6919.16s)]
*  I always think about it. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6920.04s)]
*  I don't know when I realized how much my parents loved me. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6921.0s)]
*  How old I was. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6923.88s)]
*  I never was like, they don't. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6925.24s)]
*  I mean, my mom a couple of times. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6927.4s)]
*  But as an adult, I go, what? [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6931.5599999999995s)]
*  Jamil said something to me. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6935.16s)]
*  He was like, did you never notice that your dad was the only guy that came to our basketball games? [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6936.36s)]
*  I was so used to him showing up. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6943.96s)]
*  You don't notice it until you're out of it. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6945.639999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6946.84s)]
*  Like a fish doesn't notice water. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6947.24s)]
*  You're just surrounded by it. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6949.16s)]
*  And when you see other parents that don't do it for their kids or whatever, [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6950.36s)]
*  you see your friends and you're like, oh, that's different. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6954.04s)]
*  I didn't know that existed. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6955.96s)]
*  But that was a thought I had. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6957.0s)]
*  I was like, I hope you never notice it. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6958.12s)]
*  I hope you just think this is what it is. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6962.5199999999995s)]
*  It's funny. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6964.76s)]
*  The better you are at your job, the less they're going to notice. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6965.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6967.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6968.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6970.04s)]
*  It's like the more consistent you are, the less you notice. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6970.280000000001s)]
*  Especially for dads. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6972.92s)]
*  For moms, I think you know. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6973.96s)]
*  Everybody talks about moms all the time. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6976.200000000001s)]
*  For dads, it's almost like your job is supposed to be thankless. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6978.04s)]
*  You're not supposed to get any credit. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6981.160000000001s)]
*  That's the sacrifice you make. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6982.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6984.360000000001s)]
*  It's... [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6985.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6987.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6987.400000000001s)]
*  The whole cabin kids thing is just awesome. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6987.72s)]
*  It's like it's awesome to see her... [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6989.400000000001s)]
*  She'll fall or hurt or something like that and then just reach for her mom. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6992.2s)]
*  I think it's nice for Emma to see because it's so often she does all this. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=6999.24s)]
*  Where she breastfeed the baby, she's up with it. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7003.0s)]
*  And then I come in and the baby's just like, you're funny. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7005.16s)]
*  Let's party. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7009.48s)]
*  And I think there's a part of Emma that's like, what? [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7011.08s)]
*  How the fuck she loved it? [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7012.76s)]
*  She's saying dada and all this other stuff. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7013.88s)]
*  But when she hurts herself, it's like, where's that woman? [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7016.679999999999s)]
*  Always makes me feel good. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7021.24s)]
*  There's all these tiny little rewarding things. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7023.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7026.04s)]
*  No, I think it's awesome. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7027.8s)]
*  I think it's awesome. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7029.08s)]
*  And I think it's even just that story of right before the special, sacrificing for your kids. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7030.12s)]
*  I think it's just a good reminder. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7035.08s)]
*  I think sacrificing is fundamental. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7036.36s)]
*  I think suffering for things you love, I think is intrinsic to loving them. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7039.48s)]
*  I think it's harder to love things without suffering for them. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7045.4s)]
*  I think we so often get caught up in this idea of we need to mitigate suffering at all costs. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7047.72s)]
*  I think it needs to be embraced for the things you really love. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7052.04s)]
*  I was talking about someone else who struggled to get their wife pregnant as well. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7056.2s)]
*  Similar situation as me and Emma. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7061.56s)]
*  And they were still in the process. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7065.320000000001s)]
*  And I go, there's a weird positive that comes out from this. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7066.84s)]
*  And it's like a lot of people did get their wife pregnant without even knowing. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7070.6s)]
*  It's like this baby has been thrust upon them. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7074.68s)]
*  And they have to organize their life. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7076.76s)]
*  And they're like, fuck, are we ready? [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7078.280000000001s)]
*  There's all this concern and insecurity. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7079.4800000000005s)]
*  And when you have a little struggle, as you were saying, to get there, [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7082.76s)]
*  when you're finally met with the idea that that baby is going to come, [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7087.4800000000005s)]
*  there's fear of you fucking it up or something going wrong. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7091.96s)]
*  But there's not fear of it happening. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7096.68s)]
*  Because you've already come to grips with this idea of it not. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7099.96s)]
*  So you're so grateful. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7104.52s)]
*  You're so excited. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7106.04s)]
*  It's a different energy that you approach it with. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7107.72s)]
*  And yeah, it's just really cool. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7111.96s)]
*  And yeah, I agree with you, Mark. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7116.76s)]
*  It should be hard. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7118.76s)]
*  The things that are worth it are hard. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7121.48s)]
*  When are they easy? [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7123.88s)]
*  I think it's like a biological mechanism. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7124.68s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7126.28s)]
*  I think it's built into human development. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7126.92s)]
*  By suffering, you end up growing closer with things. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7129.24s)]
*  It's like the army, I imagine. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7132.68s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7133.8s)]
*  Like a football team. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7135.32s)]
*  Suffering together draws people closer together. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7136.599999999999s)]
*  Your child is in pain, and then you're nurturing them, [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7139.32s)]
*  and you're exhausted, and you have huge commitments the next day, [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7141.48s)]
*  and you're also suffering. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7143.799999999999s)]
*  And I think it's like a bonding mechanism. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7145.24s)]
*  Through that mutual pain, you guys are closer. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7147.4s)]
*  I'm sure that's the hazing thing with fraternities a little bit. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7149.96s)]
*  Induce this kind of fake suffering so these people bond together [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7153.799999999999s)]
*  and really feel like they're part of... [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7156.759999999999s)]
*  But I think it's good. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7160.839999999999s)]
*  I try to be grateful for the moments of suffering like that. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7162.44s)]
*  It sounds masochistic, but I think it's core. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7165.08s)]
*  It's a good perspective to have. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7167.5599999999995s)]
*  You don't resent it as much. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7168.919999999999s)]
*  Miles, did you have a good Thanksgiving? [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7173.0s)]
*  I had a great Thanksgiving. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7174.599999999999s)]
*  Any funny stories? [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7175.799999999999s)]
*  No, I got to make food, which was sort of fun. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7178.12s)]
*  What did you make? [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7179.799999999999s)]
*  Usually Mark's wife handles damn near everything we've ever eaten. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7180.44s)]
*  I think Mark and I have never made something for each other [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7183.16s)]
*  or for ourselves around each other. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7185.48s)]
*  Mark's wife handles everything. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7187.5599999999995s)]
*  And I got to make little things. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7188.839999999999s)]
*  Gravy and put the turkey back in because it wasn't done. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7191.72s)]
*  Like little things. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7194.52s)]
*  It was sort of fun to be a part of that. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7195.32s)]
*  No, I do want to talk about Mark being a masochist a tiny bit. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7197.96s)]
*  Mark's been on this masochism shit way too heavy [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7201.96s)]
*  and then also got me on it recently. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7204.6s)]
*  Talk to us. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7206.6s)]
*  Did this start with the Shackleton? [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7208.44s)]
*  I think that, technically... [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7211.48s)]
*  Shackleton is a symptom. It's all part. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7211.88s)]
*  No, no, no. Shackleton, I think if we go back in time [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7213.32s)]
*  will be the actual point. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7217.08s)]
*  That's the breaking point. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7219.0s)]
*  No, Mark was just talking about this in a very loving way [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7221.72s)]
*  about his child. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7224.68s)]
*  And I think that's all beautiful and I don't want to take away from that. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7225.320000000001s)]
*  But also recently said to me, while we're both fasting, [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7227.320000000001s)]
*  he goes, soon, dude, you're going to fucking enjoy the hunger pangs. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7230.6s)]
*  When I get them, bro, when I wake up with them, I go, [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7234.360000000001s)]
*  oh, what a day I'm about to have. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7236.76s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, you're a fucking full blown lunatic. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7238.360000000001s)]
*  That's great. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7240.6s)]
*  And he's got me also fasting with him. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7241.400000000001s)]
*  How long do you fast? [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7243.72s)]
*  Like 24 hours, 36 sometimes. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7245.0s)]
*  Anything over three days, I don't think you get a ton of benefit. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7247.08s)]
*  You got a problem. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7249.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know about all this. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7250.36s)]
*  I got to give some pushback. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7251.639999999999s)]
*  It's great. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7252.759999999999s)]
*  It's built in every culture, it's built in every religion. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7253.16s)]
*  Fasting is fundamental. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7255.0s)]
*  I also think we eat too much as a culture we love to consume. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7255.799999999999s)]
*  No one ever feels hungry, even though for most of human history, [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7259.0s)]
*  we've all been hungry. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7261.16s)]
*  I don't know if that's true. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7262.04s)]
*  Why? [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7263.48s)]
*  I feel like there was just fruit everywhere. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7264.839999999999s)]
*  That's partially true. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7267.0s)]
*  Like whenever you see monkeys, it's just like, [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7268.44s)]
*  oh, all right, let me get this persimmon. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7270.5199999999995s)]
*  They're not really hurting for food. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7273.799999999999s)]
*  No, I don't think they're starving. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7275.719999999999s)]
*  But like going for multiple hours without food, I think is [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7276.92s)]
*  pretty typical, specifically without like proteins. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7280.44s)]
*  I think you do that when you're busy. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7282.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7284.5199999999995s)]
*  And I think we were just busier back then. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7285.08s)]
*  Some people say we're less busy. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7287.96s)]
*  Forcing your body to go 24 and 48 hours without food is... [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7288.679999999999s)]
*  That's not really forcing. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7292.759999999999s)]
*  Like at a certain point, just like, I don't know, it feels fun. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7293.719999999999s)]
*  You're having hunger pains. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7296.2s)]
*  Sometimes. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7298.679999999999s)]
*  Sometimes. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7299.24s)]
*  Sometimes you got hunger pains. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7300.04s)]
*  Hunger pleasures. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7301.16s)]
*  Yeah, you got hunger pleasure, bro. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7302.759999999999s)]
*  All right. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7304.12s)]
*  No, I don't know. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7304.839999999999s)]
*  That shit is nice, dude. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7305.4s)]
*  And then you get to kind of like break through in your brain. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7306.44s)]
*  Or sometimes you like a sauna, cold plunge, [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7308.68s)]
*  you try to like fucking force your brain through it. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7310.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7312.280000000001s)]
*  The only freedom is discipline, guys. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7313.0s)]
*  All right. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7314.68s)]
*  Just remember that. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7315.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7317.08s)]
*  I'm gonna... [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7317.8s)]
*  Insert the anorexic line. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7318.200000000001s)]
*  I probably have an eating disorder. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7321.8s)]
*  So Marca's eating disorder crazy, so... [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7322.76s)]
*  But now Miles is on it. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7325.160000000001s)]
*  Oh, nice. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7326.76s)]
*  Now Miles is on it. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7327.160000000001s)]
*  We do it together, suffer together. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7327.8s)]
*  He's texting me every like six hours. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7330.200000000001s)]
*  And Marca's never texted me more in his life. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7331.56s)]
*  He's never responded to a text in my life. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7333.240000000001s)]
*  And then the moment I start fasting every three hours, [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7334.84s)]
*  like, how you feeling, brother? [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7336.76s)]
*  We're in this together. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7338.200000000001s)]
*  The pain cave is nothing. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxolRtnGRQ8&t=7339.240000000001s)]
