*  Okay Al, would you rather 50 black guys or 75 Asian dudes have been with a girl? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=0.0s)]
*  You have to choose between two of them. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=7.4s)]
*  It's easy. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=8.9s)]
*  What is it? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=9.9s)]
*  Like the Asian? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=10.9s)]
*  Okay, now we have to adjust the numbers. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=11.9s)]
*  This is where it gets really fun. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=12.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=13.9s)]
*  25 black guys. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=14.9s)]
*  Whatever the other thing is. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=15.9s)]
*  Change it up even more. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=16.9s)]
*  Seven black guys. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  Oh, which blacks were you buried? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=20.900000000000002s)]
*  Francis and Ghanim. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=21.900000000000002s)]
*  Son. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  A thousand anything. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=23.900000000000002s)]
*  Alright. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=25.900000000000002s)]
*  One Francis and Ghanim, 50 Asian dudes. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=27.799999999999997s)]
*  50 Asian dudes. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  Hey guys, before we started recording, we were all trying to make fun of Alex's burlap [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=33.8s)]
*  outfit. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=40.04s)]
*  And Shultz's videographer Vala had an absolutely legendary bomb. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=41.04s)]
*  And this is what our episode is. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=44.32s)]
*  Do it one more time. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=46.32s)]
*  Chris, of course, do it one more time. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=48.32s)]
*  You want to know what I said? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=51.32s)]
*  It's like if you brought one more sack, we could have done a sack race. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=52.32s)]
*  Don't have that. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=55.74s)]
*  But he did an act though. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=58.74s)]
*  That's what you do to act out. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=60.74s)]
*  Okay, we're going to start from the beginning. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=63.74s)]
*  Oh, that's an interesting outfit. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=65.74s)]
*  Al, what are we going to say about that? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=66.74s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=68.74s)]
*  If you brought one more sack, we could have done a sack race. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=69.74s)]
*  How is that not funny? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=76.74000000000001s)]
*  It turned out to be the most funny. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=80.74000000000001s)]
*  What's up, everybody? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=83.74000000000001s)]
*  Welcome to Flagrant. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=85.16s)]
*  Your boy celebrated his 40th birthday yesterday. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=86.16s)]
*  It's Uncle Shultz now. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=88.16s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=91.16s)]
*  And I got to say thank you so much to all of you guys, my wife, Tanya, for organizing [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=93.16s)]
*  an absolutely awesome birthday. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=99.52s)]
*  That was incredible, man. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=101.44s)]
*  I really mean it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=102.44s)]
*  Thank you guys. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=103.44s)]
*  For real, that was so much fun. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=104.44s)]
*  I think that I'll be gay for a moment. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=106.44s)]
*  I think that sometimes... [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=109.52s)]
*  To some extent. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=112.3s)]
*  But I think sometimes birthdays can be tough because it creates the opportunity for disappointment. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=115.3s)]
*  When people aren't there for you for a dinner or something in regular life, you're like, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=120.3s)]
*  oh yeah, everybody's got things to do. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=124.3s)]
*  They're busy. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=126.1s)]
*  They've got friends. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=127.1s)]
*  They've got family. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=128.1s)]
*  But then on your birthday, if they don't show up... [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=129.1s)]
*  And again, this is stupid because people are busy, but you can convince yourself, there's [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=130.1s)]
*  that little devil that's like, oh, I guess I wasn't important to them or something like [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=134.7s)]
*  that. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=138.22s)]
*  You feel taken for granted. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=139.22s)]
*  You feel whatever. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=140.22s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=141.92s)]
*  But it's not even taken for... [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=142.92s)]
*  It's just like, oh man, I wish that our relationship was stronger or something like that. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=143.92s)]
*  And it was just... [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=150.0s)]
*  I mean, yeah, the surprise party was so cool, and then the after party was so cool. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=151.0s)]
*  I never want to put forced pressure on anybody. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=156.16s)]
*  I never want people to think, oh, you've got to be there for me. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=158.24s)]
*  You have to be nice to me. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=161.0s)]
*  I like earning my attention, if you will. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=162.0s)]
*  I mean, that's what we do on stage. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=164.68s)]
*  But it was just... [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=168.70000000000002s)]
*  I just felt so filled up with love, and it was awesome. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=169.96s)]
*  And I just really am grateful for you guys, man. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=173.60000000000002s)]
*  That was a great way to spend my birthday. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=175.74s)]
*  It was really cool. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=177.5s)]
*  I love you, man. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=178.5s)]
*  I love you too, man. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=179.5s)]
*  I love you, brother. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=180.5s)]
*  I love you too. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=181.5s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=182.5s)]
*  But after we're here, then you do force that whatever fucking stick shit that is. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=183.5s)]
*  Oh, dude, the middle. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=186.46s)]
*  You were filling him up. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=187.46s)]
*  That was awesome. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=188.46s)]
*  You got a good hit on that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=189.46s)]
*  Bro, that should set me home. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=190.46s)]
*  That should set me home. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=191.46s)]
*  I felt like shit after that one. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=192.46s)]
*  Tanya hit one, and she hit the stanky leg. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=197.56s)]
*  We had to hold her up. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=200.56s)]
*  We had to hold her up. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=203.56s)]
*  She came in with too much confidence. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=204.56s)]
*  Yeah, that tobacco came from Palestine. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=206.56s)]
*  Middle Eastern tobacco, his temper, bro. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=209.56s)]
*  He knows who it is. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=212.56s)]
*  Targeted. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=214.56s)]
*  Yeah, it was just such a great... [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=215.56s)]
*  It was so great, man. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=218.56s)]
*  I really am really grateful. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=219.56s)]
*  And how do you feel this morning? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=221.56s)]
*  Man, I felt like shit, but then I started to recover. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=222.56s)]
*  I'm getting good at getting hungover. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=224.56s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=226.66s)]
*  I think I'm beating it now. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=227.66s)]
*  The perks of alcoholism nobody talks about. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=228.66s)]
*  You get better at dealing with the hangover. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=230.66s)]
*  Is that it? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=232.66s)]
*  I think so, bro. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=233.66s)]
*  I think so. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=234.66s)]
*  Because the hangover I had a few days ago, I was fucked for the whole day. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=235.66s)]
*  This one I was only fucked for like half of it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=239.66s)]
*  So if I keep on drinking, I might not be hungover. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=241.46s)]
*  Come on, bro. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=244.46s)]
*  I think that's what a lot of these motherfuckers do, these cowards quit before they can fully [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=245.46s)]
*  beat the hangover. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=250.56s)]
*  You're just breaking through the other side. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=251.56s)]
*  That's what I do. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=252.56s)]
*  I drink too much, got in the hot tub, chilled out. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=253.56s)]
*  Where's your hot tub? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=255.56s)]
*  Just in my house, in my little hot tub, fell asleep a little bit, woke up. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=256.56s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=260.56s)]
*  You, wild boy. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=261.56s)]
*  With everything happening in the Middle East right now. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=263.56s)]
*  With everything happening. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=266.56s)]
*  Your birthday? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=268.56s)]
*  And my birthday. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=269.56s)]
*  What are you even talking about? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=270.56s)]
*  What are you referencing? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=271.56s)]
*  You're not my friend. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=272.56s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=273.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's not a very friendly comment at all. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=275.56s)]
*  He couldn't be referencing friends. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=278.56s)]
*  There's a black guy here. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=279.56s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=280.56s)]
*  That's a good ass point. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=281.56s)]

*  They would never. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=283.56s)]
*  They would never. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=284.56s)]
*  They would never drink. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=285.56s)]
*  What? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=286.56s)]
*  Season two that happens to every character. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=287.56s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=292.56s)]
*  Wait, are you referencing Matthew Perry's death? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=293.56s)]
*  Who's that? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=295.56s)]
*  Oh, thank God. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=296.56s)]
*  Guys, thank God. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=297.56s)]
*  It's just a coincidence what he was talking about. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=298.56s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=301.56s)]
*  Oh my God, I guess you didn't know that. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=302.56s)]
*  That's why you made that really off-color joke. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=303.56s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=305.56s)]
*  Yeah, Matthew Perry, who's an actor from the famous show Friends, has passed away. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=306.56s)]
*  Tragically. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=311.56s)]
*  He died in a hot tub, just like what you were talking about, but clearly not exactly, because [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=312.56s)]
*  you don't even watch TV, you don't even know that show. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=316.56s)]
*  Never heard of it. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=318.56s)]
*  So you weren't trying to make some edgy joke, you edgelord. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=319.56s)]
*  Oh my Lord. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=321.56s)]
*  This is a great title. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=322.56s)]
*  I like that. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=323.56s)]
*  What did happen with Matthew Perry, man? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=324.56s)]
*  This is so tragic. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=329.56s)]
*  It's sad, yo. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=330.56s)]
*  I'm a big Friends fan. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=331.56s)]
*  We know this. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=332.56s)]
*  I'm sad about this. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=333.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=334.56s)]
*  This guy died in a hot tub. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=335.56s)]
*  Struggled with drugs his whole life. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=336.56s)]
*  We don't know what happened. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=337.56s)]
*  We're still trying to figure it out. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=338.56s)]
*  But Mark is full-blown conspiracy theory on this. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=340.56s)]
*  A lot of people have been talking. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=343.56s)]
*  I don't think this is true. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=345.24s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=346.24s)]
*  Have you seen his most recent Instagram post? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=347.24s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=349.12s)]
*  Don't tell me it's something with a hot tub. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=350.12s)]
*  It's something with a hot tub. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=351.64s)]
*  There's no way there's something with a hot tub shifting. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=352.64s)]
*  It just seems strange to me. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=355.84000000000003s)]
*  It's him in a hot tub. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=356.84000000000003s)]
*  And then what the caption just says. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=358.78s)]
*  I don't know what happened. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=360.4s)]
*  All respect to him and his family, but it also is weird. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=361.4s)]
*  Oh, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=364.2s)]
*  So warm water swirly around makes you feel good. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=366.76s)]
*  I'm Matt, man. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=369.36s)]
*  Him in a hot tub. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=371.16s)]
*  I'm just saying, bro. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=372.16s)]
*  It's a huge hot tub, by the way. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=373.16s)]
*  He's got a nice tub. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=374.64s)]
*  Overlooking LA. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=375.64s)]
*  Who's taking that picture? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=376.64s)]
*  George Soros probably. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=380.68s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=381.68s)]
*  Is that him in the corner? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=382.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=384.68s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=385.68s)]
*  I thought it was just. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=386.68s)]
*  Oh, with the beats on? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=387.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=389.16s)]
*  Okay, so what do we think happened here? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=390.16s)]
*  Oh, somebody killed him. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=392.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, Mark Soros. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=393.08000000000004s)]
*  Do you think it was a murder? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=394.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=395.08000000000004s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=396.08000000000004s)]
*  Look at the evidence. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=397.08000000000004s)]
*  That's all the evidence we need right now. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=398.08000000000004s)]
*  Look at the evidence. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=400.8s)]
*  He asked it. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=401.8s)]
*  Guys, we shouldn't be joking around about this. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=402.8s)]
*  I'm not laughing at his death. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=404.8s)]
*  I'm laughing at this. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=405.8s)]

*  Come on, man. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=407.8s)]
*  I'm very sad about that. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=408.8s)]
*  Can I ask an honest question? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=411.2s)]
*  Because I think the outfit is very creative and cool. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=412.64s)]
*  This is an honest question. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=416.84s)]
*  Get your act out ready. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=417.84s)]

*  I just want to let you know. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=422.84s)]
*  Okay, so I'm already prepared to just stop at the bomb. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=424.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=428.96s)]
*  I'm not going to act it out. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=430.84s)]
*  Okay? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=431.84s)]
*  I just need to understand if this is like a paid thing. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=432.84s)]
*  You don't have a relationship with the... [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=440.08s)]
*  I do have a relationship with the... [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=441.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=442.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=443.96s)]
*  And then is this part of Halloween? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=444.96s)]
*  Because it is Halloween. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=445.96s)]
*  We're filming this on Halloween. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=446.96s)]

*  I don't think I'm just pulling a prank on you. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=474.96s)]
*  We're not pulling a prank. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=475.96s)]
*  We're trying... [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=476.96s)]
*  Why is nobody making fun of Alex's outfit? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=477.96s)]
*  That's what I need to know. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=487.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=488.96s)]
*  Why are you guys sitting here on the couch? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=489.96s)]
*  It's very out there, but it's also kind of fucked. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=490.96s)]
*  What did I say? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=492.96s)]
*  The first thing I said. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=493.96s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=494.96s)]
*  So it's like it's hard to make fun of. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=495.96s)]
*  He bombed so bad it got on our heads. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=496.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=497.96s)]
*  Let's get out of our heads. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=498.96s)]
*  We have to get out of our heads. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=499.96s)]
*  He bombed so bad. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=500.96s)]
*  We have to get out of it. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=501.96s)]
*  Stop affecting us. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=502.96s)]
*  Because if we go at it, you have to go perfect or else it's going to be... [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=503.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=504.96s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=542.96s)]
*  It's like a bag of rice or a minute. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=543.96s)]
*  Honestly, yeah, we were talking about this before the pod, how miserable you are, and [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=545.96s)]
*  I need you to just be honest with the people. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=550.52s)]
*  Are you more miserable now that you're skinny? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=552.1600000000001s)]

*  I'm being honest. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=556.96s)]
*  It's not fun trying to be skinny, but being fat sucks more. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=557.96s)]
*  You can't even stay awake. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=560.96s)]
*  What? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=561.96s)]
*  That's because I have a cold. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=562.96s)]
*  Good luck. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=563.96s)]

*  Fantastic. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=575.96s)]
*  Shouts, and then they were just passing delicious plate after delicious plate. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=576.96s)]
*  Shouts to Emelio's, bro. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=580.96s)]
*  I didn't know if I could say it or not. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=581.96s)]
*  Shouts. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=582.96s)]
*  I said shouts and I was like, wait, am I talking about- [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=583.96s)]
*  Who ordered the paparazzi? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=586.96s)]
*  Son, don't talk about paparazzi. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=587.96s)]
*  That was crazy. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=588.96s)]
*  Who ordered the paparazzi, son? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=589.96s)]
*  That was crazy. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=590.96s)]
*  Somebody did that shit. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=591.96s)]
*  You ordered the paparazzi. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=592.96s)]
*  Man, paparazzi waiting outside. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=593.96s)]
*  You just popped it out here, my brother. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=594.96s)]
*  Son, there wasn't even a card in the camera. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=595.96s)]
*  It was just flash going off. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=597.96s)]
*  Son, we go outside the restaurant. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=602.96s)]
*  We leave. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=605.96s)]
*  There's mad paparazzi there. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=606.96s)]
*  I see Charlemagne. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=607.96s)]
*  Somebody ordered that shit. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=608.96s)]
*  I'm thinking they just want pictures of Charlemagne. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=609.96s)]
*  Charlemagne also brought a congresswoman. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=611.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=614.96s)]
*  They both left though. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=615.96s)]
*  So I'm like, oh, I think it's- [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=616.96s)]
*  What a flex. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=617.96s)]
*  How do you just invite somebody? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=618.96s)]
*  Charlemagne goes to my wife, hey, it's going to be me plus three. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=619.96s)]
*  And my wife is like, yeah, that's fine. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=623.96s)]
*  Like, Andrew's 40th birthday is probably some people that are close to us or whatever. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=625.96s)]
*  And he just shows up with a fucking congresswoman. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=629.96s)]
*  Bro, that's a flex. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=632.96s)]
*  So fire. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=634.96s)]
*  She walked in and asked me, she was like, is it cool if I join? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=635.96s)]
*  I was like, I don't know. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=637.96s)]
*  I ain't here at Congress. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=638.96s)]
*  Yeah, you don't need our permission. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=639.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=640.96s)]
*  It was wild. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=641.96s)]
*  But then after Charlemagne gets in the car, paparazzi still hanging out. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=642.96s)]
*  And then Andrew walks out, flash, flash, flash, flash, flash, flash. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=646.96s)]
*  I thought y'all did this. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=649.96s)]
*  I was trying to look at the paparazzi and see if it was our friends. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=650.96s)]
*  Did you hear what Miles said? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=654.96s)]
*  Miles was killing me. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=656.96s)]
*  What did he say? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=657.96s)]
*  I walked out and we were the first ones out and the guys were there. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=658.96s)]
*  Miles was like, dude, there's paparazzi. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=661.96s)]
*  I was like, what? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=662.96s)]
*  Are you being serious? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=663.96s)]
*  How many? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=664.96s)]
*  He's like, four. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=665.96s)]
*  And then he looks and he goes, oh, fuck. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=666.96s)]
*  Like three and a half. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=668.96s)]
*  Did you make an off-color joke about a small person? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=669.96s)]
*  There's a dwarf paparazzo. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=672.96s)]
*  I forgot I said that. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=674.96s)]
*  You can't make off-color jokes like that, man. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=676.96s)]
*  Did we see that guy's photos? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=680.96s)]
*  No, it was all just crotch shot. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=682.96s)]
*  He got clear shot to me. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=685.96s)]
*  There was not a midget paparazzi. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=687.96s)]
*  There was a little midget paparazzi. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=689.96s)]
*  I missed the midget. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=691.96s)]
*  I love midgets. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=692.96s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=693.96s)]

*  You think you have? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=697.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=698.96s)]
*  They're the best. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=699.96s)]
*  I hate that we haven't found a good thing to say about this outfit. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=700.96s)]
*  I was going to say something, but I was like, fuck it. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=703.96s)]
*  If I fall again. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=706.96s)]

*  Just do it and act it out. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=708.96s)]
*  You got it. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=709.96s)]
*  You can put the midget in your outfit and toss them and then do it. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=711.96s)]
*  Now do it. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=714.96s)]

*  I knew the first one. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=744.96s)]
*  You said it was three things. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=745.96s)]
*  I knew Billy Madison. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=746.96s)]
*  This is Billy Madison. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=747.96s)]
*  That's great. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=748.96s)]
*  Yep. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=749.96s)]

*  What else, though? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=752.96s)]
*  Well, you'll see, man. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=753.96s)]
*  I have multiple, I have outfit changes during this episode. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=754.96s)]
*  You think he has all three of them on right now? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=755.96s)]
*  I thought this could be three things. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=756.96s)]
*  He hasn't had real food in 72 hours. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=757.96s)]
*  This guy is on a fucking rate. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=758.96s)]
*  Okay, the cognitive function is very low right now. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=759.96s)]
*  He was around chicken Parmesan's last night. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=760.96s)]
*  It was salivating. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=761.96s)]
*  He was angry. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=762.96s)]
*  I remember seeing him at the end of the show. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=763.96s)]
*  I remember seeing you go up to get your wife and you were so upset because there was food [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=765.96s)]
*  on the table you couldn't eat. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=772.96s)]
*  It's like seeing a married dude at a strip club. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=773.96s)]

*  But I think everyone else just hires the paparazzi around when they have to drop a movie or an [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=991.12s)]
*  album or something to get some images out there. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=995.88s)]

*  That would have been the funniest thing. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1010.12s)]

*  I'll do my best to not eat this during the pod. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1149.8s)]
*  Move it away because you know you're going to eat that. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1153.8s)]
*  Have you reflected on 40 yet? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1156.32s)]
*  Have you taken it in and been like, yo, I'm 40. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1157.32s)]
*  39 was way harder. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1159.84s)]
*  Really? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1161.12s)]
*  Yeah, 39 was way harder. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1162.12s)]
*  I remember distinctly feeling that. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1163.12s)]
*  What do you feel about 39? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1165.08s)]
*  I was 39. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1166.8s)]
*  All the emotions for 40, I felt at 39. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1168.48s)]
*  And then 40, I think a lot of times there's anxiety for dudes with their age when it comes [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1171.28s)]
*  to the things that they've achieved in their life. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1176.36s)]
*  Not even just work, which is marriage, these types of things. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1178.48s)]
*  Where am I on this course that I've plotted for myself? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1183.12s)]
*  And I feel really proud. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1186.6799999999998s)]
*  I feel happy. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1189.9199999999998s)]
*  I have friends. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1190.9199999999998s)]
*  I have a wife. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1191.9199999999998s)]
*  You know, it's my fucking dream girl. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1192.9199999999998s)]
*  My family's healthy-ish. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1197.76s)]
*  So I'm really proud of where I am in life. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1198.76s)]
*  So I didn't feel that anxiety about getting older. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1203.36s)]
*  But at 39, I was like, oh, I'm no longer young. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1206.48s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1209.84s)]
*  At 38 was the last, I don't know, it's hard to describe. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1211.84s)]
*  38 was the last time I could feel young-ish. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1216.56s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1218.9199999999998s)]
*  39 feels like 40's coming. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1220.9199999999998s)]
*  At 38, nobody's going, hey, 40's coming. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1223.6399999999999s)]
*  I do feel 40's coming at 39 right now. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1225.72s)]
*  I feel like, yo, 40's coming. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1228.12s)]
*  You gotta start. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1229.56s)]
*  I never felt super young at 35, 36, but I was like, 40's coming now. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1230.56s)]
*  You're an adult. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1235.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but you've already processed that, so 40 will be fine. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1236.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1238.84s)]
*  30 hit me, and then 31 hit me. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1239.8799999999999s)]
*  And I was like, holy shit, this number just keeps going up. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1242.48s)]
*  If you're lucky, it just keeps getting higher. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1245.6399999999999s)]
*  And then I was like, well, that's just life now. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1248.72s)]
*  So it's just gonna keep. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1250.12s)]
*  So I think- [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1251.12s)]
*  I will say this, though. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1252.12s)]
*  That shit goes by fast, bro. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1253.6s)]
*  That shit goes by fast. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1256.36s)]
*  And there's like a Socrates quote that I'm gonna butcher, but like, it's something about [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1258.12s)]
*  you're playing the game, and there's way less time left than you think. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1263.04s)]
*  I also enjoy it. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1268.5s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1269.5s)]
*  And it is true. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1270.5s)]
*  If I think about how fast 40 years went by, what a fucking- [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1272.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1276.94s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1277.94s)]
*  Like, 20 years ago, half of my life ago, feels like last year. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1278.94s)]
*  Dude, college feels very recent. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1288.94s)]
*  Living together in that apartment feels- [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1290.54s)]
*  That was a month ago. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1292.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1293.98s)]
*  And that was what, 10 years, something like that? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1294.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1296.6200000000001s)]
*  It wasn't that long ago. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1297.78s)]
*  For us colleges, 20 years ago, we were freshmen. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1298.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1301.26s)]

*  Soak it up. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1304.26s)]
*  And that's why our parents are always like, oh my God, you grew up so fast. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1305.26s)]
*  And I'm even seeing it with my nieces. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1307.34s)]
*  They're growing up. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1309.4599999999998s)]

*  When we have kids, we're gonna do the same thing that the kid gets annoyed with, and [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1312.7199999999998s)]
*  they're like, shut up. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1316.1399999999999s)]

*  You know, I was just making the whole thing up. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1716.38s)]

*  And then Bala looks at it, obviously he goes, wait, it's not real? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1734.66s)]
*  And it hurt me so bad that I'm doubling back down at Israel. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1737.66s)]

*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1955.8999999999999s)]

*  Let's just see what's going on. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1979.62s)]
*  I just think the same thing exists from the last conversation we said where it's like, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1981.1s)]
*  if you're lying to make it funnier, it's great, do it. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1985.62s)]
*  And if you are lying to be some sort of hero or to increase victimization, then it's corny. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1988.98s)]
*  And I don't think he said anything in the video that disputed that. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1995.86s)]
*  Outside of the girl situation, which I knew she was a fucking racist bitch this whole [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=1999.34s)]
*  time. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=2004.6200000000001s)]

*  That's what she's guilty of. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=2007.6200000000001s)]
*  That's what these white people do. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=2008.6200000000001s)]

*  I [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=3951.92s)]
*  Maybe he's just doing a little garden. It's exactly the break. You know, you garden. Yeah, maybe I think in the future [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=3954.12s)]
*  I'd like to garden what's on your gloves? [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=3959.92s)]
*  Well, you know gardens in the context for this like oh [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=3965.0s)]
*  Situation right here. No, no, it gets a little wild out there. Oh, yeah, you need protection for your hands, especially when you're guarding [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=3971.64s)]
*  Anyway, I don't know why you guys don't do more costumes you should take advantage of it, you know [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=3978.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm like the before he's after [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=3985.44s)]
*  Okay, listen, what do we got do we guys have feelings no facts no no no no we got Francis and got a [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=3992.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=3998.28s)]
*  Unbelievable. I'm really an amazing fight amazing fight high-level boxing shout outs of Francis unbelievable [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=3999.8s)]
*  I mean what this guy did is say again Rob. Okay, so let's go honest assessment of the scoring [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4005.52s)]
*  What did you think it was if if? [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4011.0s)]
*  Just honest assessment. Yeah, I said in the group chat [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4013.28s)]
*  I thought it was five five and then with the knockdown with the knockdown I guess that's what's valid. I had it six four [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4016.32s)]
*  Tyson yeah, and then with the knockdown I had him winning by one point. Okay [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4023.2400000000002s)]
*  Sorry who winning by one point Tyson when I said one six four and then he's a ten eight because of the knockdown [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4027.04s)]
*  Yeah, so I had him winning by one point, but I wouldn't been mad at the other way [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4033.22s)]
*  I think that's kind of how I had it. So it's like I think I had Tyson winning but because [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4036.3399999999997s)]
*  Francis was coming, you know from such a deficit the fact that he closed that gap is the victory [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4043.7s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if the decision is awful when you really think about it because people were a little bit [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4049.66s)]
*  There wasn't unanimous support for one decision [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4057.02s)]
*  There are people that thought Tyson won narrowly and there are people that thought Francis won narrowly and that's exactly what the scorecard [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4059.44s)]
*  Yeah, right. But um the judge who had it like that was kind of great. There was one that had a far right? Yeah for Tyson [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4064.04s)]
*  Right what the fuck? [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4070.5s)]
*  93 or [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4072.76s)]
*  793 there's no way because I didn't even possible with a 10. Yeah, I don't even know but Francis [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4073.76s)]
*  I think the most impressive thing with Francis was the IQ like his boxing IQ was insane [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4078.5800000000004s)]
*  yeah, like he knew what Tyson was doing and [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4084.7200000000003s)]
*  He was he had a plan of attack to mitigate it and then after he did it he was countering it [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4089.08s)]
*  So that knockdown that he got Tyson throws Tyson has his great foot movement great head movement strong jab [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4094.44s)]
*  But his main attack is a one-two [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4100.52s)]
*  He he does a lot of pump fakes to get you off your rhythm and then he sets you up and then one two [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4103.0s)]
*  Sometimes I'll come in with the hook [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4107.52s)]
*  Francis was waiting for the one-two and then trying to counter with that big hook landed it dropped him and it's just the interesting thing [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4109.28s)]
*  Happened Francis realized that Tyson couldn't hurt him. He could walk through anything Tyson could throw [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4115.92s)]
*  Yeah, keep in mind. This is who I think is the greatest heavyweight of all time. Mm-hmm [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4121.54s)]
*  I've said on this podcast Tyson fury is the greatest heavyweight of all time [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4125.28s)]
*  so Francis went up against the greatest heavyweight of all time and [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4129.28s)]
*  Almost beat him and if there's a rematch [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4134.16s)]
*  If Francis knows he can't get hurt he was walking through punches walking through elbows. Yep. Yeah, the elbow is crazy [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4138.52s)]
*  Go like this. Go like this. You got a little bit of a brash right before the break [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4146.0s)]
*  Oh, can you look at your phone? Oh gosh, you got it done there [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4149.68s)]
*  so it's like he's throwing serious shit and [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4153.28s)]
*  Francis is walking through it and then Tyson knows he cannot walk through Francis's shit [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4156.84s)]
*  Yeah, he got got and once that dynamic happens in a fight now [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4161.4400000000005s)]
*  It's up to Tyson to really outbox him. You got to move back. You got to stick that jab and you got to score points [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4165.92s)]
*  You know, you can't knock him down. That's what I thought he did [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4171.52s)]
*  He just scored points because but think about that he's going in there going I'm gonna teach this guy lesson [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4173.44s)]
*  I'm gonna spark him. He literally says when he starts the first round he goes welcome to class and then when Francis knocks him down [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4178.5199999999995s)]
*  He goes what happened professor? [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4184.36s)]
*  Amazing and there was a moment I think where Francis starts rise. Oh shit [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4187.5599999999995s)]
*  This isn't as hard as I thought it was gonna be. Yeah, I'm gonna be alright now to be fair [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4191.24s)]
*  Tyson came in sloppy. It looks like he barely even had a camp. He had no strategy whatsoever [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4195.24s)]
*  I don't even think he took the things here. No, no, it's not worth making the [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4199.88s)]
*  What's going creating the caveat for him? [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4204.88s)]
*  Of course and also like you're getting paid so much money from Saudi Arabia [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4206.76s)]
*  Like they're probably overpaying so much to hold the fight there [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4212.0s)]
*  You show up in shape. Yeah, you show up ready and you put on a fucking show like it's if I'm Saudi Arabia [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4216.72s)]
*  I mean you had this amazing fight, but I'm also like hey, dude [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4223.82s)]
*  Yeah, I don't care if you don't respect your opponent, yeah, I'm paying you crazy [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4227.08s)]
*  I'm paying you respect the pay I'm giving you exactly back to payday because you're not just doing a pay-per-view [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4231.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're overpaying [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4236.4s)]
*  So the fight is there. Yeah, so it's like so the amount of money they must have paid like, you know [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4238.44s)]
*  They flew all those celebrities out there [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4244.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't think a single celebrity all these champions waiting in the hallway just to give a Dap to Tyson on his way to the [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4246.36s)]
*  Ring did you see that? [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4252.6s)]
*  The amount of people was insane. It was like my field can't afford his own ticket out [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4254.6s)]
*  Like Tyson Econa McGregor Cristiano Ronaldo [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4260.52s)]
*  Yeah, crazy everybody those three Oscar de la Hoya Larry Holmes [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4264.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean we've seen that since Mike Tyson like where's every fighter came out Marco and Tony, but they had every champion in the last [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4269.08s)]
*  like 40 years there from all these different weight divisions, it was unbelievable and [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4276.08s)]
*  I mean, they must have lost and crazy money doing it, right? But imagine but what what did they really win? [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4280.52s)]
*  Yeah, like now we're looking at this as a destination [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4286.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, even the show that they put on like I don't give a fuck for music before sporting events [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4288.92s)]
*  But I'm looking I'm like this is a hell of a fucking show like these people are out here [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4292.72s)]
*  I think the perception of Saudi Arabia from the West is [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4297.64s)]
*  Sand oil. Yeah [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4301.6s)]
*  black cube [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4304.4400000000005s)]
*  Mm-hmm. That's it [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4305.84s)]
*  Now I think through the whatever sports washing or and these other things they're doing I think and then they're building these nice hotels [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4307.96s)]
*  And stuff, I think we're starting to go. Oh, is this another version of Dubai? Yeah, is this another version of the Emirates? [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4314.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh, wow, and they got enough money to fly every single person out there [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4320.6s)]
*  Oh, they got some boos you shit going on here and entertainment that I'd be into sports washing works. Yo [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4324.8s)]
*  Nobody's giving them credit for a brilliant idea. Really? [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4330.68s)]
*  Right marketing every state in America won a sports team. That's true. I'm trying to watch this date [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4333.62s)]
*  I feel I always thought Kansas City was just like booming Metroplex because I grew up watching football then I go there [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4338.5s)]
*  I'm like country as the football team. They sports washed it into me thinking the North Korean needs bro. They need your noble [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4343.78s)]
*  Yeah, sure noble needs a football team [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4350.38s)]
*  So, yeah, so it was just I mean the winner in this fight is [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4357.9800000000005s)]
*  Like I think they need to fight again and Tyson needs to prove that he wasn't prepared for it and he needs to dominate him [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4361.5s)]
*  Because it's a little bit of a knock on his legacy again. I was gonna ask you [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4367.660000000001s)]
*  Do you still think he's the greatest? I think he's the greatest of all time [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4371.780000000001s)]
*  But it is a knock on his legacy and what I would rather do is give Francis credit for his greatness than take away [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4374.3s)]
*  Tyson's because if I go he was never that good. That's an insult to Francis [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4380.26s)]
*  I'd rather go this is the greatest guy and it just so happens this Francis and Gano guy that absolutely dominated the UFC [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4384.3s)]
*  Is so fucking talented that he could dominate in boxing too. Mmm, you know what I mean? [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4391.1s)]
*  Like if we cut the let press of your first boxing [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4396.38s)]
*  Your first boxing matches against the greatest boxer in history. Yeah, you [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4400.660000000001s)]
*  Potentially out box. Yeah [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4405.42s)]
*  You knock him down once but it's not like he's just going and throwing a makers. He made Tyson [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4408.34s)]
*  Afraid to throw. Yeah. Yeah [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4414.620000000001s)]
*  Tyson's the greatest boxer of all time. He's not just a guy like John T. Wilder who's got the nuclear fucking punch [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4418.06s)]
*  He sits you down. It's over. He will out box anybody and you were right in front of him and he was afraid to throw [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4423.42s)]
*  Mm-hmm. No inference of Francis wasn't he a boxer before UFC? [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4428.9400000000005s)]
*  I mean like in the in the way that you learn boxing is one of the disciplines before you get into MMA [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4431.9400000000005s)]
*  He had a little background in it. Here's the background that I have. It's like LeBron played football in high school [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4438.02s)]
*  Yeah, and then you just go become a basketball player, right? [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4443.76s)]
*  And to that end I don't know how you can and I love both of them [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4446.1s)]
*  But I don't know how you can not take some credit away from Tyson because if Tom Brady the greatest football player of all time [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4448.780000000001s)]
*  Played LeBron one-on-one and lost 11-9. I'd be like, yeah [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4453.400000000001s)]
*  I I'm judging LeBron a little bit like that shouldn't happen. I don't care how good good Tom Brady is a basketball [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4457.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm judging you 100% 100% and I think that we try to justify it by going [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4464.5s)]
*  Oh Tom wasn't taking it that seriously LeBron went to yeah, sorry. Sorry LeBron wasn't taking it that seriously where in this circumstance [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4468.820000000001s)]
*  I'm like if this is boxing it ain't basketball like you got to take this [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4475.46s)]
*  Out yeah, so it's like I know you were taking this seriously because you got dropped. Yeah [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4480.26s)]
*  Yeah, I guess in my brain the prep you didn't take seriously. Oh, yeah [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4485.22s)]
*  Yeah, so that's where you come in slopped sure but at the same time [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4489.44s)]
*  It's like you've been preparing since you were five years old like Tyson doing 12 rounds. He can do with no training camp [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4492.26s)]
*  He's been boxing so long credit to Francis for sure [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4498.78s)]
*  I just think you also have to to me. It's like I can't not look at I can't look at Tyson as the greatest right now [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4502.22s)]
*  If they run it back and then he it's no problem then it's like alright fine. This is all forgotten [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4507.46s)]
*  but right now I'm looking at Francis super impressed, but I am also looking at Tyson like [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4512.06s)]
*  Really greatest heavyweight of all time. That's what my friend who knows boxing always says [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4518.18s)]
*  But I'm looking at it as a guy doesn't watch it time being like I don't know man. That seems crazy [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4521.860000000001s)]
*  I mean [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4525.780000000001s)]
*  There's only one person that I think could potentially beat him that has a chance and it's Lennox Lewis [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4526.360000000001s)]
*  Because you need some of the size. I mean Tyson's 5'9 [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4531.44s)]
*  Mike Tyson at 5'10. Sorry Tyson is 6'9. Oh Mike Tyson at 5'10 [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4535.58s)]
*  It can't yeah, the arms won't even read it. It just can't it's too much [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4542.04s)]
*  5-6 9 can move jab throw punches balance amazing [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4547.68s)]
*  What do you think of Francis doing other boxing match? [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4552.76s)]
*  I mean go for the money and what I want is the UFC to resign him and then give them the back [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4555.44s)]
*  kind of and then just be like and I want to know and give them the bag give them the [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4560.5s)]
*  problem is they're not gonna give him the bag and the freedom because then they'll have to do that with all the other fighters [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4564.780000000001s)]
*  yeah, but I want him to go back and get the bag and [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4568.860000000001s)]
*  Because then the UFC has the baddest man on the planet the baddest man on the planet [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4572.54s)]
*  We know right now. Yeah, his name France in Francis and got him. Yep, and that's no knock on John Jones [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4576.66s)]
*  But John Jones just tore his peck. He's out of the fight [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4581.860000000001s)]
*  I'm also looking at this like if I'm John Jones [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4585.38s)]
*  I don't want to fight steep a if I want to go down as the baddest man ever which that's what everybody thought John Jones [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4587.9s)]
*  Was before this fight. I got a fight that Francis and got a dude and [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4594.139999999999s)]
*  Let me tell you something if Francis and got him can maintain distance between [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4598.46s)]
*  6-9 Tyson Fury and himself. I [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4604.0599999999995s)]
*  Don't care who [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4608.82s)]
*  Anybody else is [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4611.62s)]
*  You are not taking it lightly [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4613.54s)]
*  Coming in for a shot on Francis [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4616.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, John Jones out wrestling sure is this one is better [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4620.22s)]
*  But did you see the way that Francis was throwing Tyson Fury around the ring in the clench? [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4622.660000000001s)]
*  Tyson never felt that in his life [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4628.02s)]
*  Every boxing match Tyson ever he looked a little surprised. What the fuck? [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4630.620000000001s)]
*  Anytime they clinch up usually what Tyson can do in a clinch. He's so big and so strong [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4634.3s)]
*  He can just be imposing and lay on the guy and put a lot of [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4637.820000000001s)]
*  Fucking Francis was yanking him up throwing him around doing every wanted. Yeah, and shout out to Francis conditioning [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4641.5s)]
*  He was winded earlier and then phenomenal. You know, he was still came back. Yeah [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4649.14s)]
*  I thought about like the fifth round. I was like, okay, I think Tyson got it now [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4652.78s)]
*  He's gonna win every round and it was like the eighth round where Francis was like just gone [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4656.42s)]
*  Yeah, wow this I did not expect. Yeah. What about Deontay Wilder Francis? I think it'd be an amazing fight everybody watch it [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4660.1s)]
*  Francis injects interest and [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4667.379999999999s)]
*  Excitement into the heavyweight division Tyson had dominated so much that people stopped caring and now every fighter Anthony Joshua [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4670.459999999999s)]
*  Francis and Gatto would be huge. I would love to see that [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4678.259999999999s)]
*  Do you think that matchup will be more equal in a way like Deontay and Francis just cuz of power? [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4680.9s)]
*  Yeah, but here's the thing if Francis boxes as well. Here's the thing if [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4686.459999999999s)]
*  Tyson couldn't hurt Francis. Yeah Deontay is gonna test that chip [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4692.339999999999s)]
*  That's where I'm gonna do while there's knockouts and so savage. I'm like and hard to watch and Tyson landed [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4696.42s)]
*  That's my point. He lies in is a better boxer, but Deontay might be a harder opponent [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4703.62s)]
*  That's the thing and you're 100% right there because Tyson did land [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4708.06s)]
*  Francis could walk through it and that's problem. I don't think you can walk through Deontay [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4711.62s)]
*  I don't think there's a human on this planet that can walk through Deontay [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4715.78s)]
*  So Tyson might be a better fight for Francis, right? [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4718.06s)]
*  Anthony Joshua has a lot of pop [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4723.18s)]
*  Maybe that's a tougher fight [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4726.1s)]
*  but this specific one where was a guy whose power wasn't so dominant that he can't walk through it and [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4727.5s)]
*  His power is really effective. It might have been the perfect one [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4733.38s)]
*  But he's still in jet. He has one more massive boxing fight if you want. He has two more [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4737.22s)]
*  He has a rematch with Tyson whenever you want and we're all buying that in a fucking heartbeat [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4741.9400000000005s)]
*  If I'm him, I actually wait for that. Mm-hmm. I go fuck the I go [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4745.34s)]
*  I tell Tyson to say fuck the the usik fight hold off on the usik fight [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4749.34s)]
*  Let's do another fight for your belt [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4753.9s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4758.259999999999s)]
*  That's the fight I want to see that is the fight I want to see I want to see that rematch [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4760.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah, because that's what I want to see. I would love to see him fight Joshua to [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4763.9s)]
*  Joshua Deontay Wilder, I think would be the biggest money fight because I worry power power power and they're gonna land and [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4768.339999999999s)]
*  Deontay is gonna throw god and it's gonna be mayhem. It's gonna be absolute mayhem [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4776.46s)]
*  But yeah, like heavyweight boxing to me this excited one against each other who he put your money on [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4783.98s)]
*  Francis or Deontay I'd say wilder [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4788.66s)]
*  Yeah, just based off of in terms of winning probably Deontay really I think yeah [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4791.42s)]
*  I think for after what I saw from Francis, I think I could [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4796.78s)]
*  Dude, it's hard. He was boxing. He was boxing and he was defending and he saw the things coming [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4799.54s)]
*  Also like Tyson is way more difficult to prepare for than Deontay Deontay. You're watching one hand the whole fight [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4804.74s)]
*  Tyson you gotta watch everything movement faints the whole thing [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4810.9800000000005s)]
*  So with a guy whose IQ is as impressive as Francis's maybe he'll develop a game plan where he can [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4814.22s)]
*  You know handle that power and also that's the thing with Francis. It's like he's felt [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4820.58s)]
*  I'm not saying MMA guys MMA punchers punch as hard as boxers. Clearly they don't but he's had [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4825.74s)]
*  Four ounce gloves hit him in the face as hard as possible [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4832.74s)]
*  Yeah, the guys who have like boxing backgrounds like steep a I think was a golden gloves to like he's [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4835.42s)]
*  a box [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4840.34s)]
*  And he walked through it [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4841.38s)]
*  Once you walk through four ounces you put them pillows on your hands [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4843.66s)]
*  It's crazy. I [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4847.9800000000005s)]
*  Thought the fight was gonna have four ounce glove. That's what they initially were saying. Yeah [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4849.78s)]
*  Yeah, and when that didn't happen, I was like, well, this isn't even gonna be fun [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4853.3s)]
*  But if it if there's four ounce gloves Francis wins that fight in the third round. It's over [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4857.06s)]
*  Oh god, it's in the side of the head before I suppose it's over. Yeah, Tyson's out [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4861.66s)]
*  Yeah most shocking result any of us ever saw and to be honest [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4865.58s)]
*  I think he won the fight when that happened. I think we're all like, oh he won whatever happened [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4869.24s)]
*  He doesn't have to win the win. Oh, yeah, and that's the beauty of I think MMA has injected that into us [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4873.12s)]
*  We're just like sometimes you can win through losing or tying [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4878.2s)]
*  You know, it's [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4882.679999999999s)]
*  Presidents saying human also what a fucking story. I mean unbelievable [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4884.679999999999s)]
*  It this is kind of a sad thought but I was like man [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4888.719999999999s)]
*  Are there other Francis's that just couldn't make it here right make it to the thing like you are the goat [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4890.8s)]
*  There are these and we like to think most of them make it through but maybe not because Francis [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4896.16s)]
*  Overcame everything to get here and he might be the greatest fighter period of all time. Maybe bro [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4900.68s)]
*  I don't know fighting but if you can box like that [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4905.58s)]
*  Do you see like that like maybe the greatest fighter ever period? Yeah, so there's probably other Francis just we never said [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4907.48s)]
*  We're gonna a movie right now. They must right? I mean fuck a movie. I want a video game, bro [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4914.64s)]
*  I want to play his life on Xbox like you literally you start as a kid [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4917.96s)]
*  Do the mining shit get on a boat make to America fight a little bit the last of us and this is my family [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4922.44s)]
*  He's last of us but real life. Yes. I think what Francis as long as it's not a hypothetical for him fucking [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4928.28s)]
*  I get it. That's it. All right. So listen while we talk about some sports [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4941.5599999999995s)]
*  It's time to get them prize picks in them Akash locks. I actually heard the Akash locks came through [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4945.84s)]
*  Yo, I won last week and then this week I did it this is what's cool about price picks [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4950.2s)]
*  I did a six leg pick. Yeah during the second half you can do second half picks [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4954.76s)]
*  So I did six legs laws live stream in the cowboy game and I only got four of them still made money price picks still [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4959.84s)]
*  Paid me even though two missed which no other nobody else to do that. Normally you pick mad shit you lose and that's it [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4965.88s)]
*  That's it. You're done. Yeah, I'm gonna hit you some NBA picks right now. Okay, they got use of Nurgich [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4972.0s)]

*  Doing more okay, and then you get more rebounds than that and then Donovan Mitchell five rebounds [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4979.32s)]
*  Against the Knicks because it's a Knicks. I think there's gonna be a lot of missed shots [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4985.24s)]
*  I'm gonna go more there also, so I'm doing more and more on this one [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4988.84s)]
*  Let me know how it works out for you price picks also use a promo code Schultz [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=4992.4s)]

*  Legendary promo for only fans. Yeah [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5012.9s)]

*  $61 million during his time in the NBA was in the 90s in the 90s in early [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5053.740000000001s)]
*  61 million in today's dollar just like [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5058.179999999999s)]
*  200 million probably yeah, but if you live in that life you could go through that [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5061.54s)]
*  You gotta have a gambling addiction. Yeah, I mean like you gotta try to spend 61 you do it [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5065.3s)]
*  but it takes work like gambling or like [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5070.26s)]
*  vacations like [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5073.099999999999s)]
*  Spending 61 million having no assets left is fucking hard to do without gambling and again 61 million [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5074.98s)]
*  Then it's like probably probably like 200 million now, even if you buy a car, even if it's half the value you still get half back [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5080.66s)]
*  31 million you want 61 million cars you have 31 million dollars [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5087.74s)]
*  So maybe there's a Bitcoin speculator. Have you looked into that? Have you seen this? [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5091.42s)]
*  Are you guys in the same group chat you might have a little what's on an only fans [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5097.0199999999995s)]
*  Get my titties out there. I mean it is crazy though, but like if he didn't know there's no way that this guy's going [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5101.66s)]
*  Years without knowing what his wife is doing, right? No, they know it's all fucking put together a hundred percent [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5108.94s)]
*  Yeah at first my thought was I didn't watch the video but I was like, oh, there's no yeah [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5113.78s)]
*  This is crazy his wife of one and I was like, oh they probably are in on this together [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5117.9400000000005s)]

*  Kaisen that jail stream have you seen close from it? So I've never watched like a stream live [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5132.74s)]
*  But I don't I'm probably like most people I've watched tons of clips [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5137.58s)]
*  Yeah, like it's amazing like God bless the people that are clipping out these strips because they have to watch it [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5141.62s)]
*  They have to watch it and edit down to the fun shit for us to enjoy. Yeah, and [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5147.54s)]
*  I think Kai has been really transformative with the streaming where he like creates games out of it [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5151.9400000000005s)]
*  Mm-hmm [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5157.4400000000005s)]
*  and like I've seen certain people travel and certain people do these things and [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5158.02s)]
*  Everybody kind of repeats the same thing, you know, it's like I'm gonna go to Japan. That's like, okay [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5162.74s)]
*  Well now I'll go to Japan and then everybody goes to Japan and then blah blah blah and it's like [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5167.14s)]
*  No real nothing really unique but like at least this scenario he's creating is truly unique within the streaming space [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5172.06s)]
*  He's creating a game out of it. Yes, and [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5179.9800000000005s)]
*  This guy's great. He's reaping the rewards. It's a really smart way of going about content. Yeah free car, man [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5182.86s)]
*  Hold your head bro. You know, hold it down, bro. So what's the deal? Is this a set or did they rent out an old jail? [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5189.06s)]
*  I think they got an old prison. That's what it looks like an old prison or they got a movie set [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5194.86s)]
*  That was used like you know, I mean like I'm sure LA has a prison set [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5200.46s)]
*  Yeah, that is built in the exact same, you know structures whatever like a prison to shoot all the shows [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5206.26s)]
*  Like where did where was Oz shot? Yeah, you know, where was Shawshank shot? [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5212.26s)]
*  Yeah, probably there but it's great and then energy like injecting all of the different famous people as well into it [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5215.660000000001s)]
*  Bro, he makes prison look way too fun though. That's the problem. That's kind of a prison is [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5222.34s)]
*  Dude I talked to guy on my part a week ago that said if I could get laid in prison, I'd be there for the rest [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5230.18s)]

*  It's like the only thing is female contact. It's like it's the only thing. Yeah, there's no responsibility [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5242.620000000001s)]
*  Completely remove the anxiety of personal accountability. Yeah, I think if you gave them female contact things would be way more relaxed [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5247.660000000001s)]
*  Maybe one more a lot less violence in the prison. You got a milk of maybe you just milk them [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5254.38s)]
*  Yeah, you like line them up you line them up. I'm Lee line exactly. Yeah, I am down for that usage of AI [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5258.64s)]

*  But then what do you do with all of it [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5268.92s)]
*  Like all the samples that's actually a good point cuz you don't want to put it back out there in the world because then you're [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5271.52s)]
*  Just making more felons. Mm-hmm. So [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5275.76s)]

*  Maybe you can feed it to pigs or something [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5285.76s)]
*  Like weird stuff. Yeah, I bet you put it in the soil use a ball motherfucking beanstalk [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5288.64s)]

*  What's the feedback been with it positive? [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5307.68s)]
*  Haters, I mean always some people saying this is you know, the Stanford prison experiments are like this could go that way whatever this [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5310.200000000001s)]
*  Glorifies negative stereotypes blah blah blah, but the guy's making content. He's not trying to change the world. Yeah [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5316.92s)]

*  What were you wearing yesterday because you were six four yesterday [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5335.040000000001s)]
*  I would just stand it up straight cuz I had a tight shirt on so I can't slug [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5339.4800000000005s)]
*  I usually slouch. I have a tight shirt on I stand up straight. You were six for you. Swear to God [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5343.12s)]

*  There's another one that's more incriminating where they draw it out. It's a different way. He's sitting down [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5371.52s)]
*  That one. Yeah [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5378.4800000000005s)]
*  Yes, it's a little dark though. That's the only thing [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5381.040000000001s)]
*  It's a little sketch. Yeah, you need it to be lighter, but it is bad [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5385.68s)]
*  It's a little sketch. There's a diagram right here. I let that man live, bro [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5390.52s)]
*  Is that false advertising? What do you think? I mean have you seen him walk their politicians? [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5394.76s)]
*  He walks on in the Bill Maher show and it's very interesting. No a little wobbly. Let me see. All right [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5399.48s)]

*  Think that's what he did. No, I think he did Guantanamo stuff. I would look into seeing that [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5408.599999999999s)]
*  I thought he was a fighter pilot lost my vote [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5413.44s)]
*  They can get rough for me [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5417.2s)]
*  Because if he's a fighter pilot, he's sure to fly [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5420.2s)]
*  Why they're all struck you have to be to fit in the cockpit. Oh really small thing [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5422.799999999999s)]

*  Yeah, I don't know. I got so dark. Oh, come on, man. We got things up [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5451.32s)]

*  Did he pivot right? He's just I think he's more central my long like distant view or whatever [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5460.799999999999s)]
*  It seemed like he always hated religion, but liberals thought he was only talking about white religions and they were like, yeah [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5467.839999999999s)]
*  That's our guy and then he's like no all religions. I don't like Islam either [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5474.48s)]
*  Fuck you. You're a hate monger. You're not who I thought you were and then I asked a liberal about that [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5479.48s)]
*  He was like, well, I just don't think you should punch it down [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5484.52s)]
*  Which I thought was the most racist thing you could possibly say [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5486.52s)]
*  She's like well the Muslims are beneath us. You can't hit them. I thought back in the day used to be like [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5489.200000000001s)]
*  Far left he was like like super liberal back in the day [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5494.0s)]
*  That was like I smoke weed and it should be legalized being gay is okay. That should be legalized. They should get married and [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5498.040000000001s)]
*  Christianity's dumb that that was like a liberal and now [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5505.400000000001s)]
*  Being left has shifted more into [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5509.96s)]
*  The gender politics and I think that he's rejecting gender politics and then like woke ism [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5512.84s)]
*  So like you can't make offensive jokes or we have to be really sensitive about everything and I think that shift [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5518.639999999999s)]
*  he's pushed back on there's like a [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5523.639999999999s)]
*  It's really funny when we were in the Netherlands. I think we spoke about this on the pod, but like [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5525.88s)]
*  the Netherlands they don't have any like [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5530.12s)]
*  Religion doesn't play any role in the laws that they create. Yeah, right. We spoke right. Yeah, and [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5533.28s)]
*  and [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5539.04s)]
*  Because of that they can choose the lesser of two evils, right? [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5540.4s)]
*  Like they can decide both of these things are wrong, but we'll choose this lesser wrong thing. For example making prostitution [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5543.24s)]
*  Prostitution legal because that stops human sex trafficking. So like this will be wrong [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5551.679999999999s)]
*  But it's less wrong than this other thing and then we'll create laws around it and they're really struggling right now when it comes to woke shit [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5556.96s)]
*  And gender identity politics. They were the most progressive [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5563.5199999999995s)]
*  They were like [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5567.5199999999995s)]
*  Back in the day [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5569.12s)]
*  There's this massive gay parade that the whole city comes out for the whole town everybody celebrates it because in their very literal mind [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5570.0s)]
*  They're just going well, like well, yeah, if you're gay and you like someone else that's not hurting anybody [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5577.4s)]
*  There's no net negative on society. Like yeah, it's it's legal. Let's make it legal. That's fine [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5580.84s)]
*  There's and there's no God telling me that this is wrong [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5585.9s)]
*  So I'm just going off of the car facts and the car fax is this doesn't hurt anybody [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5588.68s)]
*  Everything's fine and now they're grappling with 70 different genders and they're like but this doesn't make sense [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5592.98s)]
*  So they've went from the most progressive [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5600.259999999999s)]
*  to seemingly [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5603.0599999999995s)]
*  Conservative about certain issues, but they were never progressive. They were just [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5605.66s)]
*  Mathematical practical. Yes, you know, I mean it was just they your logic [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5612.66s)]
*  It was pure logic and they didn't have a religious influence on the laws [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5617.28s)]
*  Yeah, so it's I think they're having a little identity crisis because they're like wait [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5621.1s)]
*  I thought we were the progressives and we're so forward-thinking and we're the most profound and advanced culture in Europe [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5625.14s)]
*  And now we're getting looking at as bigots because we don't believe in 70 different genders. It's kind of interesting how like [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5631.06s)]
*  Yeah gender politics can expose [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5638.620000000001s)]
*  What the real motivation for your laws is? [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5642.42s)]
*  Mm-hmm, and [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5644.54s)]
*  There's was never let's accept everybody there's were like this makes logical sense. Yeah, I [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5645.98s)]
*  Still like that better [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5652.0199999999995s)]
*  I think and I think that's probably where most people are with it if I'm being honest [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5652.98s)]
*  like I think most of us are like if you're not hurting anybody else, do you think do your thing and [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5657.48s)]
*  As long as it's logical, it makes complete sense that some people are attracted to the same sex [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5663.299999999999s)]
*  Like that's not a yeah thing to me. But when I've taught my whole life [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5668.74s)]
*  There's only two genders and now three okay cool when you get to I think there's like a hundred and eight is the most [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5671.6s)]
*  Reasonless I looked at it's like well now I'm not I'm a little confused. Yeah, it's still ain't hurt [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5677.360000000001s)]
*  Nobody do you think if you want to be a little plus be an octopus? Yes [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5681.240000000001s)]
*  Until you get into like the reassignment surgery when they're younger and that's where things start to the kind of spiral [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5685.68s)]
*  Like putting them on the puberty block puberty blockers or hormone blockers [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5691.92s)]
*  I think that's where people can potentially get hurt [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5696.04s)]
*  And I think that's where if you are a very literal state like the Netherlands you're going [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5699.94s)]
*  Okay, I think this could potentially hurt somebody so we have to legislate around it. Mm-hmm [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5704.98s)]
*  It also seems like parents are just afraid of like the social contagion [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5711.9s)]
*  Like is this something that my kid would want to be interested in? Yeah, even if they're not yeah [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5715.14s)]
*  I don't know if that fear is found. I don't know if there is like a social contagion [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5720.74s)]
*  So they're worried about them doing shit today genitals when they're young [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5723.7s)]
*  But they can snip their dick off when they're a baby and they don't care they don't get a say in that [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5727.78s)]
*  Not be talking. Okay. Now we talk. Oh, but I agree with you. Yeah, I think we should stop snips lips [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5732.98s)]
*  Yeah, I think I think that that's a I think there's a very [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5738.26s)]
*  Compelling argument for that and you can get yours restored [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5742.58s)]
*  There is a there's foreskin like first restoration surgeries work. Yep. Can you pick the coat? Yep. Yeah [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5745.9s)]

*  That episode of how to with John Wilson no at the end of one of the episodes [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5758.74s)]
*  He's the episode ends with him talking to a guy who is like big on [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5762.96s)]
*  Getting your foreskin back and lengthening it and he sells his product where you can clip it on your foreskin and it [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ORwrijSMs&t=5767.9800000000005s)]
