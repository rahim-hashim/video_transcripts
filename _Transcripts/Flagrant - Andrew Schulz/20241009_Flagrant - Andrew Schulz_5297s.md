*  Tampon Tim, it's hard to say. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=27.3s)]
*  There's some like Omrad Kamala. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=29.28s)]
*  It's a little hard to say. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=31.520000000000003s)]
*  She's not bad, but when you put the names together, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=32.72s)]
*  it's a little like, you got to be able to pew. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=35.52s)]

*  Trying to get at him. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=45.92s)]
*  How are we doing so far? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=48.24s)]

*  She lied about many things, and she's a liar. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=57.68s)]
*  I have a hard time doing it to them. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=59.68s)]
*  You know, I'm basically a truthful person. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=61.76s)]
*  Hello, everybody. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=69.84s)]
*  Welcome to Flagerant. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=70.56s)]
*  And today, this is the first time that we've been able to say [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=71.68s)]
*  is we are sitting down with Mr. President. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=74.72s)]

*  Thank you very much. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=78.72s)]
*  Thank you, fellas. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=79.52s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=80.32s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=80.88s)]
*  This is awesome. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=81.52s)]
*  We have a bunch of questions. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=82.4s)]
*  We're very, very grateful for your time. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=83.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  I just became a dad. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=86.08s)]
*  My buddy over there just became a dad, Mark. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=87.75999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=89.44s)]
*  That's good. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=89.94s)]
*  Okay, so here's his first question. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=90.44s)]
*  You have these children that are seemingly well-adjusted, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=93.44s)]
*  successful, and I think most importantly, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=99.28s)]
*  they appear to like you. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=103.91999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=104.88s)]
*  They're better. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=105.38s)]
*  I grew up in the city, and there's a lot of people who had [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=106.0s)]
*  very wealthy parents, and the kids kind of resent them. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=109.84s)]
*  They're almost waiting for them to die. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  And they end up in rehabs. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=115.52s)]
*  Doing drugs, God knows what. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=118.16s)]
*  How do you raise them in the public eye where they still [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  become ambitious and successful? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  So I do have good kids and five really wonderful children. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=126.64s)]
*  And different, very different. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=132.16s)]
*  They are so different. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=134.16s)]
*  But one thing that was in common that I did, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=135.44s)]
*  I always used to say when I was with them [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=137.44s)]
*  or when they were leaving a room, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=140.32s)]
*  I would drive them crazy. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=142.0s)]
*  No drugs, no alcohol, no cigarettes. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=143.83999999999997s)]
*  I would say that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  Did you say that to Don Jr.? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=147.44s)]
*  Yeah, Don's a little wild. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=149.2s)]
*  He can be a little tough. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  He told me a funny story. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=156.32s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=157.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=158.48s)]
*  I talked to a bunch of people I was trying to prepare for this interview. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=159.83999999999997s)]
*  He told me a funny story. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  And he said to me, he goes, once he asked if he could have [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  a couple of friends over for New Year's, was it New Year? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=167.6s)]
*  No, no, it was July 4th. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=171.04s)]
*  On top of Trump Tower. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=172.39999999999998s)]
*  Five friends. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=173.44s)]
*  He's like, I want five friends. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=174.0s)]
*  You're like, okay, I'm out of town. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=175.04s)]
*  Go for it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=176.16s)]
*  He brings 200 people over to Trump Tower. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=177.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=180.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=180.39999999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=181.04s)]
*  He says that you weren't supposed to be there. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=181.6s)]
*  You end up showing up. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=183.76s)]
*  You hear some noise upstairs. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=185.6s)]
*  You come up. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  You go, what the fuck is everybody doing here? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=189.04s)]
*  Get the hell out of my house. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=191.12s)]
*  He said he cleaned for the next 36 hours. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=192.64s)]
*  And he said, to this day, you have never brought up that it even happened. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=195.28s)]
*  And he said, I'm starting to believe it might not have happened. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=200.72s)]
*  Can you give him closure? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=207.44s)]
*  No, it happened. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=208.48s)]
*  No, I can never give closure. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=209.28s)]
*  You can never forget. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=212.96s)]
*  A lot of people like to forget things. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=215.76s)]
*  You can't know. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=217.44s)]
*  He's a good guy. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=218.08s)]
*  And he's taken a lot because he was always a good student. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=219.52s)]
*  He went to the Wharton School of Finance, which is great. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=223.44s)]
*  And he did well. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=226.56s)]
*  But he went into the world of politics not because he wanted to, but because I was there. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=227.6s)]
*  And I sort of automatically, you drag the family in. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=233.76s)]
*  And this guy, what he had to go through with Russia, Russia, Russia. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=238.0s)]
*  Because he said, Dad, they're asking me questions about Russia. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  I don't know anything about Russia. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=243.92s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=245.12s)]
*  And all of a sudden, he's in front of grand juries. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  He's in front of Congress. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  It was a hoax. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=250.24s)]
*  It was a total hoax. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=250.88s)]
*  This was made up hoax by crazy Nancy Pelosi and these maniacs. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=251.84s)]
*  Hillary Clinton, who's totally nuts. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=256.96s)]
*  And this went on for two years. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=259.91999999999996s)]
*  And he goes, Dad, I know nothing about this stuff. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=262.56s)]
*  And he goes before the grand jury. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=264.79999999999995s)]
*  And you have Comey, who's the worst, just a bad guy. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=266.4s)]
*  But he went through a lot. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=271.84s)]
*  And it actually made him tougher. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=274.32s)]
*  I don't know if that's good or bad. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=276.79999999999995s)]
*  But he's a tough cookie, that one. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=278.47999999999996s)]
*  And in his case, it made him tougher. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=280.56s)]
*  Ivanka did a great job. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=284.56s)]
*  She didn't want anything. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=285.84s)]
*  All she wanted to do was get people jobs. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=286.88s)]
*  I would have made her the ambassador to the U.N. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=289.28s)]
*  I wanted to do that. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=291.44s)]
*  I think she would have been incredible, the whole aura. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=292.24s)]
*  She would have been great. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=295.44s)]
*  But she didn't want that. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=296.24s)]
*  She didn't. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=297.12s)]
*  And that would have been a very glamorous position. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=297.68s)]
*  She would have been great there. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  All she did is go to see companies and hire people. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=302.0s)]
*  She wanted. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=305.12s)]
*  And she hired, I think it was like 10 million people, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=305.84s)]
*  some incredible amount of people. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=308.32s)]
*  She'd go to Walmart. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=310.32s)]
*  She'd go to Exxon. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=311.36s)]
*  She'd go to these big companies and see if she could get groups of people hired. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=312.32s)]
*  And she loved doing it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=317.04s)]
*  It was great. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=318.0s)]
*  And there was no glamour. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=318.64s)]
*  There was no anything. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=320.15999999999997s)]
*  But she got people jobs that made her. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=321.04s)]
*  So how do you instill the ambition in the kids? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=322.64s)]
*  I think a lot of kids that grow up with wealth, they kind of are lazy [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=324.8s)]
*  and they feel like they have no direction in life. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=329.2s)]
*  And a lot of times they turn to drugs and other shit. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=331.04s)]
*  How do you instill the ambition? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=333.12s)]
*  Well, you know, I've seen a lot of wealthy families [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=334.8s)]
*  where the kids are mostly don't work out too well. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=337.44s)]
*  Some don't turn out to be bad kids, but they end up hating the father [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=341.52s)]
*  or the father maybe wanted him in business. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=344.72s)]
*  I mean, I have one father that's very competitive with his son. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=347.36s)]
*  If the son were more successful than him, he would be unhappy. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=351.6s)]
*  I said, are you crazy? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=356.48s)]
*  It's supposed to be the other way around. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=357.68s)]
*  My father was so proud of me. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=359.76000000000005s)]
*  He was a successful guy. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=361.44000000000005s)]
*  But my father wanted me to be more successful. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=363.76000000000005s)]
*  I mean, he was so proud of all the things. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=366.96000000000004s)]
*  I wish he could have seen what happened because we did things. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=368.56s)]
*  But he was, you know, he's just a proud father. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=371.92s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=375.52000000000004s)]
*  And I think most fathers are that way. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=376.40000000000003s)]
*  I hope that. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=378.08000000000004s)]
*  But I've known many fathers that are very successful, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=378.64000000000004s)]
*  that didn't want their that broke up over their son's success. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=381.76s)]
*  If, you know, in the few cases where the son was more successful, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=384.8s)]
*  which was very seldom, actually, you know, it's very seldom. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=388.24s)]
*  You take people like in sports, because in sports you see it [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=392.40000000000003s)]
*  because it's a microcosm of life, but it's quicker. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=395.52000000000004s)]
*  And you'll take like the greatest golfers [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=399.04s)]
*  and they'll have a son and he'll be really good as a young. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=400.88s)]
*  But they never supersede almost. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=403.52s)]
*  I can't think of any. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=406.96s)]
*  They never supersede the father in terms of success. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=408.08s)]
*  And in sports, generally baseball, you can go to a lot of different sports. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=412.15999999999997s)]
*  And it really is a sort of a microcosm of life. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=416.24s)]
*  But with life, it takes a lot longer to find out the other. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=419.36s)]
*  It comes to fruition. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=422.24s)]
*  I'm sorry to interrupt you, but you said we said you're a great father up top. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=423.04s)]

*  Elon interviewed me on something. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=477.03999999999996s)]
*  And I think they said 275 million hits. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=479.84s)]

*  When I saw the rocket engines come back, I said, what is that? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=503.6s)]
*  Like a couple of years ago, you know, I've seen rockets go up and then they crash into the water. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=507.44s)]
*  And I see the engines are coming back and they're landing. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=511.6s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=515.12s)]

*  And they land right on the top of the spot. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=520.48s)]
*  And my wife can't parallel park. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=522.4000000000001s)]

*  His family was there. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=610.72s)]
*  And two other people that were very badly hurt were also celebrated. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=611.84s)]
*  They were very badly hurt. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=615.52s)]
*  They weren't actually expected to live. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=616.48s)]
*  And they live and they had incredible doctors. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=618.64s)]
*  Some of those country doctors are better than the big doctors [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=621.84s)]
*  that we spend a lot of money on and they don't do as good. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=624.48s)]
*  I will tell you right now. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=627.76s)]
*  I don't want to knock anybody, but those country doctors saved two people [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=628.88s)]
*  because I was told that three would be in trouble. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=632.08s)]
*  And three were going to now quarry immediately. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=638.4000000000001s)]
*  But the other two were so bad that they thought they would make it. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=640.96s)]
*  And those country doctors, they pulled them together. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=644.1600000000001s)]
*  They did a great job. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=647.9200000000001s)]
*  OK, so you're going back into this place where there was this assassination. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=648.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=652.32s)]
*  They hit you headshot. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=652.8000000000001s)]
*  You survived. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=654.72s)]
*  Yeah. It was not a good feeling. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=655.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=657.9200000000001s)]
*  Are you scared? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=659.2800000000001s)]
*  No, I'm not scared. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=660.0s)]
*  You know, I sort of I have an attitude suggesting it sort of it is what it is. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=663.36s)]
*  Does that make any sense to you guys? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=668.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=670.08s)]
*  You do what you have to do. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=670.64s)]
*  I felt it was important to go back. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=672.08s)]
*  A lot of people, I guess, agreed with me because it was over 100. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=674.8s)]
*  I think they said 108,000 people in the end. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=678.08s)]
*  That's a lot of people. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=680.72s)]
*  Several. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=681.76s)]
*  And I had no guitar. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=683.84s)]
*  You know, if you have a guitar, it's easy. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=685.44s)]
*  You don't have a guitar. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=687.44s)]
*  Those who said Qatar. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=688.1600000000001s)]
*  I have Qatar. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=690.4000000000001s)]
*  I do have that. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=692.48s)]
*  They like me very much. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=693.2s)]
*  But I don't have a guitar. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=696.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you have a guitar. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=697.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=698.96s)]
*  So anyway, but that was an amazing it was amazing. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=699.44s)]
*  No, I like it when somebody like Elon, who has a lot to lose, is willing to do what's right. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=703.0400000000001s)]
*  Some people know it's right to do. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=710.64s)]
*  And I'm not just talking about endorsements and all, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=712.8000000000001s)]
*  but they don't want to do things because they're. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=715.2s)]
*  They want to cause them opportunities. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=718.88s)]
*  They want to be politically correct. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=720.96s)]
*  And actually, they're doing a bad thing, I think, for themselves and for a lot of people. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=722.32s)]
*  They may represent. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=727.2s)]
*  Okay, opening line when you walk out there. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=727.92s)]
*  I was wondering what you were going to say. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=731.44s)]
*  And as a comedian, you can see the moment. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=733.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=736.4s)]
*  He was a hell of a comedian, by the way. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=737.36s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=739.12s)]
*  That's what the word is. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=739.6800000000001s)]
*  So I hear you go, I hear you know, I see the video and you go up there and you go, as I was saying. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=740.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=746.64s)]
*  Crowd goes fucking berserk or what? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=747.6s)]
*  They went, I would say crazy. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=751.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=753.84s)]
*  I wasn't sure. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=755.04s)]
*  Poppies experience. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=755.6800000000001s)]
*  I'll tell you how, you know, you have this as a comedian or even as a not as a comedian, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=756.8000000000001s)]
*  just when you make a speech or you make some very serious statement. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=760.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=763.84s)]
*  So we're at a very serious and somber event because we're celebrating a life that is no [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=764.72s)]
*  longer with us. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=769.92s)]
*  And I wasn't sure whether or not that thing, I had it in my mind for a long time. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=771.68s)]
*  Once I said, I'm going back, which I wanted to go back to me. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=777.04s)]
*  I wanted to actually finish my speech. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=780.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=782.4s)]
*  When I got up, I said, let me finish my speech. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=783.04s)]
*  But I'm surrounded by like eight very large men and a very wonderful woman. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=787.1999999999999s)]
*  You saw that. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=792.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=792.9599999999999s)]
*  But I'm surrounded by, I guess they said, sir, no way. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=794.16s)]
*  And I have blood pouring down. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=797.36s)]
*  But I wanted to, I really wanted to finish my speech. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=798.48s)]
*  I think I had like 50,000. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=801.6800000000001s)]
*  I had a lot of people there. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=803.2s)]
*  And, you know, when I went down, it was sort of like embarrassed. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=805.28s)]
*  I said, I went down in front of all these people. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=808.4s)]
*  You know, that was my first thing. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=811.04s)]
*  I said, I don't want to be embarrassed. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=812.32s)]
*  You were embarrassed that you went down after being shot. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=813.84s)]
*  Well, you weren't exactly sure what the hell was happening at first. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=816.48s)]
*  You know. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=819.12s)]
*  But also you came back up with a fist. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=819.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=821.2s)]
*  That's one of the hardest pictures. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=821.44s)]
*  But I was also, you know. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=822.64s)]
*  Did you hear them say he's down or were you just like, I'm going. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=823.84s)]
*  When I got hit, I assume that it's funny. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=826.88s)]
*  Is it? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=831.84s)]
*  When I was down there, it is sort of strange. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=832.32s)]
*  I guess now it's a little bit. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=834.96s)]
*  We can smile a little bit, but not really because the three guys, one killed, one, two very badly. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=836.32s)]
*  But when I went down, I had total realization it wasn't a surreal. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=841.76s)]
*  You know, they talked about a surreal. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=848.08s)]
*  That could be a surreal experience. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=849.84s)]
*  Like when somebody, something happens, some traumatic thing happens. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=851.28s)]
*  People are, they lose focus. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=854.64s)]
*  They have no idea where they are. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=856.48s)]
*  They, you know, I've heard many people where that happens. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=857.6800000000001s)]
*  Something really terrible happens. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=861.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=864.08s)]
*  It was just the opposite. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=865.04s)]
*  I knew exactly what had happened. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=866.16s)]
*  I got shot in the ear and Secret Service thought I may have been shot. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=867.84s)]
*  Actually, they're pretty sure that I was shot all over because there was a lot of blood. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=874.32s)]
*  Just a little fact. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=878.16s)]
*  If you get shot in the ear, it's the bloodiest place. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=879.04s)]
*  It bleeds more than anything else. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=881.2s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=882.72s)]
*  Now, it's good to be shot this way, not that way. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=883.36s)]
*  That way. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=887.6800000000001s)]
*  That's good. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=888.72s)]
*  So if I don't turn, I wouldn't be doing this right now. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=889.52s)]

*  Thank you so much. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=939.36s)]
*  Peace. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=940.64s)]
*  Let's get back to the show. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1000.8s)]
*  My son Don told me actually he's a great shooter. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1001.68s)]
*  So is Eric. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1004.08s)]
*  They're great shooters. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1004.64s)]
*  They're like better than scratch. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1005.52s)]
*  OK. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1007.6s)]
*  If you use it. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1007.92s)]
*  And they say it's amazing because it was 130 yards. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1009.6s)]
*  To me that sounds like far away but it's not. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1012.96s)]
*  For shooting it's not. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1015.84s)]
*  He said that would be like sinking a one foot putt [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1016.8s)]
*  for just a decent shooter. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1019.76s)]
*  Wow. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1021.12s)]
*  And I don't know if you guys are shooters but they said [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1021.84s)]
*  if you're a shooter it's almost impossible to miss. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1024.6399999999999s)]
*  It's that close. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1027.52s)]
*  It's really considered that close. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1028.16s)]
*  I mean three four or five hundred yards is very doable [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1030.48s)]
*  but this is supposed to be very close. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1033.6000000000001s)]
*  And so he said gee I think Don became more religious [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1036.4s)]
*  actually you want to know that had a big impact. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1040.16s)]
*  He said it's impossible. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1042.24s)]
*  The doctor actually when I got to the hospital [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1044.64s)]
*  they were fantastic. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1046.64s)]
*  Butler Hospital. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1047.92s)]
*  I get there and the doctor greeted me [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1049.44s)]
*  and looked at me and looked it over. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1052.16s)]
*  He said you are the luckiest man I've ever met. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1054.5600000000002s)]
*  He said you should immediately go out and buy a lotto ticket. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1060.32s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1063.92s)]
*  He's telling me to buy a lotto ticket. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1064.48s)]
*  There's blood all over the place. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1067.12s)]
*  And he said I've never he said I've been doing this [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1068.96s)]
*  for 25 years. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1071.68s)]
*  I said he said I've never seen a thing like this [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1072.72s)]
*  because it's just you know just whacked it. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1075.52s)]
*  But it was something that was you know relatively [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1078.32s)]
*  relatively not so bad compared to what could have happened. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1081.52s)]
*  So I feel very lucky. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1084.8s)]
*  It was an amazing experience a horrible experience [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1086.8s)]
*  in most ways. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1090.72s)]
*  In some ways it was beautiful because I was somehow [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1092.08s)]
*  hopefully Corey's protected too who's the firefighter [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1097.9199999999998s)]
*  and he's in a good place maybe a better place than we're in. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1101.4399999999998s)]
*  Because this world is a little bit on the tough side. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1104.9599999999998s)]
*  But it was it was an amazing experience. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1107.36s)]
*  Do you feel like an increase in your spirituality [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1109.76s)]
*  after something like this? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1114.6399999999999s)]
*  Especially when I'm hearing from people that do shoot [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1116.0800000000002s)]
*  and are good at it that it was almost impossible to miss [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1119.92s)]
*  from you know like a one foot putt. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1123.44s)]
*  You start to breathe. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1124.88s)]
*  You got to miss it. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1125.8400000000001s)]
*  That's a bad putt. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1126.64s)]
*  He equated it to a one foot putt. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1129.2s)]
*  When they say that I say wow that's so you're saying [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1131.6000000000001s)]
*  they said a bad shooter would hit you from that distance [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1135.04s)]
*  a hundred percent of the time. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1140.56s)]
*  That's pretty that's pretty good. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1142.4s)]
*  Here I am. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1144.24s)]
*  We're doing this wonderful interview with four geniuses [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1145.12s)]
*  that are hottest pistols. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1148.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1149.4399999999998s)]
*  Good hearing this guy. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1150.6399999999999s)]
*  Likewise. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1152.8s)]
*  Pretty good stuff you got. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1154.56s)]
*  So anyway so but here we are. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1156.48s)]
*  Who do you think tried to take you out? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1158.48s)]
*  So I'm going to give you some big breaking news. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1161.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1164.8s)]
*  Love that. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1165.36s)]
*  Because you're I know the kind of show and it's entertainment [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1165.9199999999998s)]
*  but it's also very serious. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1168.96s)]
*  I mean I get the whole picture. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1170.1599999999999s)]
*  And you know what if it was just funny stuff [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1172.0s)]
*  you wouldn't have the success you've got to be honest with you. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1173.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1176.24s)]
*  It's nice to intersperse it but I'll give you something. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1176.9599999999998s)]
*  So first of all I have great respect for the Secret Service [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1180.3999999999999s)]
*  and the guys that were with me I went down [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1183.6s)]
*  and I did a good job going down [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1186.24s)]
*  because those bullets were winging over my head. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1187.6s)]
*  If I would have been up for another couple of seconds [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1189.4399999999998s)]
*  I also wouldn't have been here. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1191.28s)]
*  But I didn't consider that as lucky as turning to the right [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1192.56s)]
*  at that one it was like one sixteenth of a second [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1196.3999999999999s)]
*  was the only time that I was safe essentially. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1199.76s)]
*  If I would have gone a little further I would have been hit. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1203.12s)]
*  If I would have gone not as far I would have been hit. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1205.2s)]
*  I mean I had like this little tiny moment [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1208.08s)]
*  and the amazing thing is the sign is always on my left [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1210.96s)]
*  and it's always at the end and I only use it 20 percent of the time [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1214.3999999999999s)]
*  maybe even less than that. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1218.48s)]
*  This was a chart. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1219.52s)]
*  This was a chart on immigration because I have the record. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1220.96s)]
*  I did a great job in immigration. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1223.76s)]
*  They are not doing too well right now. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1225.92s)]
*  Stay on the breaking news. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1228.72s)]
*  Stay on the breaking news. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1229.68s)]
*  So here's the breaking news. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1230.48s)]
*  So you have this shooter and you have another shooter right. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1232.3200000000002s)]
*  So this shooter had three or so cell phones. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1235.68s)]
*  The FBI has never gotten them opened. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1242.72s)]
*  The other shooter three apps they call them [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1246.0s)]
*  and I believe they were foreign based apps [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1248.88s)]
*  from what I understand. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1251.8400000000001s)]
*  They haven't opened them and they're foreign based [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1254.48s)]
*  and you know you hear all about Iran [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1256.96s)]
*  because I was rough with Iran but I want to see Iran do great. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1258.48s)]
*  I want to see Iran do great. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1261.68s)]
*  But I want to stop all the killing and all this [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1263.68s)]
*  and I was rough on Iran and they supposedly have a hit on me. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1267.1200000000001s)]
*  In fact I think it takes great courage for you people [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1271.1200000000001s)]
*  to be interviewing me because it could be now. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1273.6s)]
*  Well we didn't know that before we got in here. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1276.56s)]
*  No if you would have known that you might not have done this. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1278.0s)]
*  In fact this is a good way of me getting the interview to be short. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1281.6s)]
*  All of a sudden he's going to say you know okay that's it. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1285.92s)]
*  You go see my daughter. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1289.44s)]
*  They have three apps and foreign based two of them [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1291.1200000000001s)]
*  maybe three of them are foreign based. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1295.52s)]
*  They haven't opened them yet. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1296.8s)]
*  Why wouldn't you open them when you hear about Iran [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1298.96s)]
*  or when you hear about you know foreign. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1301.04s)]
*  Then the other one had six cell phones and they haven't opened. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1303.1200000000001s)]
*  Now you know it's very hard to open a cell phone. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1307.84s)]
*  Only Apple can do it in theory unless you have somebody. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1310.0s)]
*  But they had no problem getting the J6 people cell phones open. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1312.88s)]
*  They opened their cell phones very quickly. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1316.24s)]
*  You know we have two countries in a way. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1319.04s)]
*  What's happening here is very bad very dangerous. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1320.56s)]
*  We almost had one because I had the greatest economy [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1323.1200000000001s)]
*  in the history of our country and people were coming together. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1327.76s)]
*  We almost had one but we really do have two right now [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1331.28s)]
*  and it's a shame because I think we'll get them together. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1334.24s)]
*  Success will bring us together. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1336.64s)]
*  But they should get those phones opened. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1338.0s)]
*  And you know when there's an assassination attempt [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1340.88s)]
*  on a former president who's now I'm proud to say leading in all the polls [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1343.92s)]
*  against the Democrat. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1348.3200000000002s)]
*  I don't know which one is running. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1350.0800000000002s)]
*  You know you don't know what the hell's going on. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1351.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm the only one that I run against. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1352.88s)]
*  I run against two Democrats but this is a first. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1354.48s)]
*  We do we create a lot of firsts. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1357.92s)]
*  Usually you run against somebody here. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1359.3600000000001s)]
*  I run I had to invade. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1360.72s)]
*  I was way up on him. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1363.1200000000001s)]
*  And then they say oh let's put this is like with Dana White a fighter. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1364.96s)]
*  So you're fighting and the one guy's getting killed [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1368.3200000000002s)]
*  and they say oh that's okay let's put in another fight. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1371.1200000000001s)]
*  Put him in. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1373.52s)]
*  To finish it off. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1374.0s)]
*  Okay you're fighting. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1374.8s)]
*  Say hey wait a minute I have a brand new fighter in here. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1375.84s)]
*  WWE. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1377.6799999999998s)]
*  I spent 150 million dollars on beating Biden. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1378.32s)]
*  And then all of a sudden I hear that they're going to overthrow him. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1382.1599999999999s)]
*  It was it was a coup. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1384.72s)]
*  I mean it really was. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1385.76s)]
*  But I would like them to open up these apps and find out what's in there. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1387.6s)]
*  And so he had six cell phones. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1393.84s)]
*  Who has six cell phones? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1396.48s)]
*  Having six cell phones is weird. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1397.9199999999998s)]
*  I have cell phones. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1399.6s)]
*  If I ever have two it's like a lot. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1401.04s)]
*  He had six cell phones. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1403.4399999999998s)]
*  Why does he have them? [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1405.28s)]
*  And why haven't they opened up those cell phones? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1406.48s)]
*  So if you had to guess. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1408.56s)]
*  And it's different. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1409.6s)]
*  You know if you're a drug dealer I think it's terrible in many ways [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1410.24s)]
*  but I guess from another standpoint Apple the primary group [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1414.08s)]
*  people buy those ones because they will never open them for any reason. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1419.04s)]
*  But they got them open on J6. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1423.36s)]
*  You know they opened up their phones but they don't open. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1426.16s)]
*  And this is big stuff. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1429.12s)]
*  This is an assassination attempt and it could involve other countries. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1430.3999999999999s)]
*  There was that San Bernardino shooter that they hacked. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1435.12s)]
*  The FBI was able to hack into the phone. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1437.6799999999998s)]
*  Apple didn't give it up but they were able to hack in. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1439.52s)]
*  There are some people in the world very few that can that have an ability to sometimes be able to hack in. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1440.8799999999999s)]
*  Got it. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1447.9199999999998s)]
*  Very rarely actually. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1448.3999999999999s)]
*  It's an amazing thing when you think that with all the genius you almost can't do it. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1450.08s)]
*  But Apple has a key and the key is open. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1454.4799999999998s)]
*  I mean it just they can do it immediately. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1456.8799999999999s)]
*  But they don't do it and they don't do it. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1459.6s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons that like I hate to say it drug lords feel very confident that [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1461.6s)]
*  they'll never be exposed and they use their cell phones. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1467.1999999999998s)]
*  Their Apple phones and maybe it's that way with other companies. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1470.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1473.12s)]
*  They have Samsung. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1473.4399999999998s)]
*  They have other companies but it's very hard. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1474.32s)]
*  Apple is very strong in that. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1477.52s)]
*  But when it comes to the assassination of a president leading candidate, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1479.04s)]
*  former president all that I think the rules have to go out and they have to open those things. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1483.4399999999998s)]
*  Then they have to find out. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1487.9199999999998s)]
*  And in terms of national security, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1489.6000000000001s)]
*  some people would say you have to either punish Apple or you have to get somebody that can do it. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1491.3600000000001s)]
*  But in terms of national security, so the one guy has six phones, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1496.32s)]
*  lots of messages to people. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1499.92s)]
*  Who are those people he's calling when he's hiding behind a bush? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1501.68s)]
*  So if you had to guess, I'm sure you thought obviously you thought about this a lot. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1504.32s)]
*  It's an assassination attempt. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1507.2s)]
*  If you had to guess who do you think is responsible? [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1508.32s)]
*  These are great questions. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1511.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't get these questions from the fake news. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1515.44s)]
*  Yeah, Rosie O'Donnell. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1517.52s)]
*  Let's ask him. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1518.56s)]
*  Like deface the nation. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1519.04s)]
*  They have the woman of Brennan. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1520.16s)]
*  She's on deface the nation. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1522.08s)]
*  She was terrible with the way she handled J.D. Vance who did a great job the other night. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1523.36s)]
*  But I don't get questions like that. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1529.84s)]
*  Did you ever hear of the show? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1531.6s)]
*  Deface, ladies and gentlemen, it's Donald Trump on deface the nation. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1532.8s)]
*  It's called face the nation. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1537.2s)]
*  They spend millions of dollars. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1540.8799999999999s)]
*  I was like, did we name a show that? [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1541.92s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1544.16s)]
*  You didn't hear of it. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1545.6s)]
*  That's good. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1546.32s)]
*  They spend millions of dollars on the name CBS. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1546.96s)]
*  And then I come along and I say deface the nation. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1550.64s)]
*  Or meet the fake press. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1555.2s)]
*  I say meet the fake press. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1558.08s)]
*  And they spend all this money and then I say it once and it goes to millions of people. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1559.8400000000001s)]
*  But no, they are fake. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1563.8400000000001s)]
*  But some of these questions are much better. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1565.04s)]
*  Well, thank you. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1568.24s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1568.8s)]
*  I'm honored. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1569.44s)]
*  Much better. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1569.8400000000001s)]
*  You still haven't answered them. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1570.4s)]
*  That was the best answer to the question. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1571.6000000000001s)]
*  That's your second best answer. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1574.72s)]
*  You know what I'm trying to do? [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1575.92s)]
*  You almost shone us out of it. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1576.56s)]
*  Trying to get out of it. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1577.84s)]
*  Well, look, if you look at assassinations or attempts, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1581.44s)]
*  first of all, you realize I'm in a very dangerous business. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1586.0s)]
*  Because one one tenth, think of this, one tenth of one percent of auto racers die. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1590.16s)]
*  Bull riders, I think that's pretty dangerous, right? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1599.52s)]
*  I don't know much about it, but I think it's... [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1602.0s)]
*  I wouldn't want to be on one of those suckers. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1604.24s)]
*  I see them flying off and the hoof is like an inch from the eye. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1606.32s)]
*  And when it hits the eye, you're gone. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1609.68s)]
*  Right? [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1611.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1611.52s)]
*  They are very... [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1611.92s)]
*  Well, it's about the same. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1612.96s)]
*  One tenth of one percent. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1614.72s)]
*  And other things, it's never much more than that. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1617.28s)]
*  That's sort of maxed out, I think. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1619.52s)]
*  You know, race car drivers, bull riders, I think that's pretty much tough. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1620.96s)]
*  UFC fighters, it's none. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1625.2s)]
*  You know, I don't think anyone's ever actually... [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1628.48s)]
*  On UFC, MMA or boxing. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1630.16s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1632.32s)]
*  It must be. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1632.8s)]
*  It was always tragic events. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1633.2s)]
*  Amazingly, boxers die a lot. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1634.24s)]
*  But UFC, Dana tells me it's a safe sport. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1637.1200000000001s)]
*  I say to me, it's much rougher. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1639.3600000000001s)]
*  But you know, it's pretty amazing. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1641.28s)]
*  They've never... [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1642.72s)]
*  In UFC, they've never lost. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1643.28s)]
*  And they run a great operation. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1644.72s)]
*  They've never... [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1646.4s)]
*  Nobody's died. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1647.2s)]
*  But with presidents, it's like a substantial percentage. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1648.48s)]
*  Way higher than we realize. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1651.92s)]
*  You look at Lincoln and Kennedy and this and that. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1652.88s)]
*  At temps, Reagan. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1656.4s)]
*  You go through McKinley. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1656.72s)]
*  Yep. Garfield. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1659.52s)]
*  You look at a lot of people. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1660.8s)]
*  I'm in a very dangerous... [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1662.64s)]
*  Dangerous business. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1664.5600000000002s)]
*  Profession. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1665.8400000000001s)]
*  I call it a profession. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1667.2s)]
*  Dangerous profession. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1669.0400000000002s)]
*  I like that. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1670.0s)]
*  I'm sitting with you guys. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1670.48s)]
*  You have a very nice safe life. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1671.44s)]
*  Me? [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1673.0400000000002s)]
*  So no, if you said 5%. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1673.76s)]
*  I think he called us soft. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1675.0400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, but think of it. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1676.5600000000002s)]
*  5%. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1679.0400000000002s)]
*  That's a lot. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1680.5600000000002s)]
*  That's high. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1681.1200000000001s)]
*  That's a lot. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1681.68s)]
*  And yeah, I think even the attempts is something like 25%. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1682.3200000000002s)]
*  Attempts is getting into a really crazy number. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1685.2800000000002s)]
*  So people don't think of that. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1688.64s)]
*  You run and you see and then you win and you're down Pennsylvania. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1691.28s)]
*  You're looking at everything. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1694.4s)]
*  So you're a dangerous guy. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1695.2s)]
*  So it's one of those things. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1700.08s)]
*  I was saying before though that I do a thing called a weave. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1701.04s)]
*  And there were those that are fair that say this guy is so genius. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1704.72s)]
*  And then others would say, oh, he rambled. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1709.92s)]
*  I don't ramble. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1711.8400000000001s)]
*  I weave. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1712.8s)]
*  If I saw the story, what you do is you weave things and you do it. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1713.1200000000001s)]
*  You have to have certain things. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1718.08s)]
*  You need an extraordinary memory because you have to come back to where you started. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1719.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1722.96s)]
*  You always a weave is only good if you come back. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1723.2s)]
*  They would give you credit for that. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1724.8s)]
*  You could go all the way over here and then get back. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1726.48s)]
*  I can go so far here or there. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1728.08s)]
*  And I can come back to exactly where I started. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1731.6s)]
*  Now, someday when you don't come back to where you started. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1734.24s)]
*  You're Biden. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1737.52s)]
*  But the weave is the way when you're telling like a story. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1740.96s)]
*  I was telling a story at a rally the other day in front of thousands of people. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1743.36s)]
*  And I started off and then. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1747.52s)]
*  Something in the story. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1749.44s)]
*  I actually mentioned Air Force One. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1750.8799999999999s)]
*  It was Air Force One was there. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1754.1599999999999s)]
*  So I mentioned Air Force One and then I said how I got one point six billion dollars off [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1755.68s)]
*  the price of Air Force One. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1760.08s)]
*  So but then you have to come back to the story. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1761.6s)]
*  Where was Air Force One taking you? [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1763.44s)]
*  As I was. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1764.96s)]
*  I do a weave. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1765.76s)]
*  I call it the weave. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1766.8799999999999s)]
*  And some people think it's so genius, but the bad people, what they say is, you know, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1768.32s)]
*  he was rambling. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1774.24s)]
*  It's not a rambling. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1775.84s)]
*  There's no rambling. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1776.56s)]
*  This is a weave. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1777.2s)]
*  This is a weave. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1777.84s)]
*  I go with the weave. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1778.48s)]
*  Good name. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1779.6s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1780.08s)]
*  That's another name. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1780.48s)]
*  We had fake news. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1781.1999999999998s)]
*  We came up with lots of names. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1781.9199999999998s)]
*  But the weave is I think we should make the weave a part of that stable. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1784.0s)]
*  Yeah, you really weaned away answering my question twice. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1787.6s)]
*  You really weaned away. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1790.1599999999999s)]
*  Brilliant. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1791.12s)]
*  So I don't even want to know the answer anymore. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1791.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I lost interest. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1793.84s)]
*  We'll weave back. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1796.1599999999999s)]
*  Let's weave back to his question. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1797.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1798.32s)]
*  This is where it started. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1800.48s)]
*  We'll weave back to it. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1801.9199999999998s)]
*  So I sort of hate answering it because I don't want to give any false identities. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1803.68s)]
*  I don't want to do anything having to do with creating something that isn't there. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1813.44s)]
*  You would look at Iran. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1818.48s)]
*  Iran has an open threat out for me. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1819.7600000000002s)]
*  That's bad. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1822.0s)]
*  And Biden, if he were a real president, if he were the kind of guy he should be, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1823.0400000000002s)]
*  should say if anybody shoots a former president who's now the leading candidate, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1828.0800000000002s)]
*  even though he's leading against Democrats, we will bomb that country into oblivion. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1833.76s)]
*  And it would stop. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1843.44s)]
*  And that's been said before with some people. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1845.1200000000001s)]
*  You know, there have been people, I won't go into it, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1847.1200000000001s)]
*  but there have been people that have been threatened in another party even. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1849.1200000000001s)]
*  In the same party, it makes sense and probably happens pretty quickly. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1854.56s)]
*  But in another party, you know, it's hard for them to want to protect me, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1857.76s)]
*  but it shouldn't be hard. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1862.56s)]
*  Other people have protected other people. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1864.56s)]
*  And what you have to inform those people is if they do it, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1866.8s)]
*  the country will be blown to smithereens. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1870.7199999999998s)]
*  The entire country will be blown to smithereens. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1872.8s)]
*  And those threats go away because that's a really bad threat for a country. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1876.6399999999999s)]
*  Forget about me. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1879.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm an individual. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1880.7199999999998s)]
*  But I represent something very important. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1881.76s)]
*  That's true. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1883.6s)]
*  That's a really terrible threat. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1883.92s)]
*  So I mean, there are others that could be in that category. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1886.24s)]
*  Look, I took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1889.52s)]
*  at a level that no president took in anything. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1893.52s)]
*  I had tariffs on China, took in hundreds of billions of dollars. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1897.12s)]
*  They're still there. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1900.72s)]
*  That without me, they wouldn't have those tariffs on. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1902.0s)]
*  So you could say, but no, I think Iran would be the one. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1904.48s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a break for a second, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1909.44s)]
*  because we got to shout out the greatest law firm in America. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1911.12s)]
*  Morgan and Morgan, America's largest personal injury law firm. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1915.84s)]
*  For over 35 years, they've been fighting and winning for the people [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1920.3999999999999s)]
*  just like you and me. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1924.7199999999998s)]
*  They've won so much that they've racked up more than $20 billion [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1927.76s)]
*  in recoveries for their clients. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1931.1999999999998s)]
*  That's right, billion with a B. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1932.9599999999998s)]
*  So when life tries to slam you with an injury, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1934.32s)]
*  it might be time to tap in to Morgan and Morgan. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1936.9599999999998s)]
*  And because they've got your back, I'm excited to announce [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1940.24s)]

*  Now, entering to win is easy. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=1950.8s)]

*  Let's get back to the show. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2018.8799999999999s)]
*  I was tough with other countries, but I got along very well with them. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2019.84s)]
*  But you know, we were like a pussycat. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2022.48s)]
*  We were ripped off by every nation in the world, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2025.44s)]
*  and some of the worst grippers were our so-called allies, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2028.24s)]
*  people that countries that we supposedly get along with us with. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2031.68s)]
*  But they're the ones that took advantage of us on trade at a level like, you know, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2036.48s)]
*  I mean, I ended some of the dumbest trade deals I've ever seen [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2040.8s)]
*  and made them much better for the country. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2043.8400000000001s)]
*  I mean, what difference does it make? [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2045.44s)]
*  I made I made I took a terrible trade deal would make it a good trade deal. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2046.64s)]
*  But like Japan, I redid the trade deal. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2050.96s)]
*  South Korea, I did the trade. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2052.88s)]
*  The deals I went to Abbe of Japan. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2054.64s)]
*  I said, Shinzo, he was assassinated. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2058.16s)]
*  He was he was as you probably know, he's incredible. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2060.88s)]
*  Great man. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2063.68s)]
*  He was a great leader for the people. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2064.48s)]
*  They loved him. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2065.92s)]
*  I said, Shinzo, look, we can't do this. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2067.04s)]
*  The trade deal is so bad. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2070.08s)]
*  We're friends, but I have to renegotiate the trade deal. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2071.6s)]
*  And he said to me, I knew that would happen. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2074.88s)]
*  I said, why did you know? [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2078.88s)]
*  Because you're right. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2080.7999999999997s)]
*  It's so one sided. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2081.6s)]
*  Wow. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2082.72s)]
*  He said, I knew you'd catch us. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2084.08s)]
*  But they went through many presidents where Japan was as an example, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2086.0s)]
*  they'll send us millions of cars. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2089.7599999999998s)]
*  We're not allowed to send them any. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2091.44s)]
*  They send us their their farm product. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2093.36s)]
*  We were sending them practically nothing. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2097.04s)]
*  It was like a one way. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2098.96s)]
*  Everything was one way. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2100.3199999999997s)]
*  And by the way, virtually every China was the worst, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2101.52s)]
*  but there were many countries almost as bad. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2105.2s)]
*  The European Union was almost as bad in my opinion. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2107.84s)]
*  You know, it sounds nice. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2110.56s)]
*  Oh, the European Union is so nice. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2111.52s)]
*  They were ruthless in their trading. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2113.84s)]
*  And I said to Angela Merkel, how many Chevrolets do we have in the middle of Berlin? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2115.6800000000003s)]
*  Why? [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2121.52s)]
*  I don't believe any. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2121.92s)]
*  I said, you're right. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2123.04s)]
*  And yet we take in the, you know, all of that. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2124.6400000000003s)]
*  We take in Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and we take in all of this Volkswagen. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2127.04s)]
*  We're taking in all of these millions and millions of cars. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2133.04s)]
*  I say, how many American cars are in the middle of Munich or Berlin? [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2136.4s)]
*  And the answer is none. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2141.52s)]
*  And I had things change around. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2143.12s)]
*  So, you know, you could say, I think that the answer would be at this moment, Iran. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2144.88s)]
*  And I think they could catch him. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2151.6s)]
*  And if we had a real president, which we don't, we don't have a real president. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2153.12s)]
*  We have a man that is grossly inept. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2157.3599999999997s)]
*  And it's very dangerous because these guys are all at the top of their game. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2161.2s)]
*  When you talk about President Xi and you talk about any one of the leaders in the world, [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2165.12s)]
*  Macron, and he's a smart guy. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2169.12s)]
*  He's all for France. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2172.0s)]
*  I mean, he would take the shirt off your back if you didn't know what you were doing. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2173.2s)]
*  So when you're with these guys, are these guys all sharks? [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2179.04s)]
*  And you can sense the energy immediately? [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2183.44s)]
*  Yeah, not all of them, but some of them aren't sharks in terms of- [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2185.6s)]
*  How are you assessing personality when you meet them? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2189.44s)]
*  Well, I can tell you, like Modi, India. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2191.04s)]
*  He's a friend of mine. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2197.2799999999997s)]
*  He's great. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2198.08s)]
*  He's the nicest India. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2199.3599999999997s)]
*  This is for you. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2200.88s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you, do you like him or not? [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2201.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2203.04s)]
*  Do you like him? [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2203.52s)]
*  I have family on both sides. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2204.08s)]
*  I have family that loves everything in family. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2205.7599999999998s)]
*  I'll just tell you though. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2207.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, they had, you know, before him, they had, they were replacing him every year. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2209.92s)]
*  It was very unstable. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2213.68s)]
*  He came along. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2215.2s)]
*  He's in a lot of trouble. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2215.68s)]
*  He's great. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2216.4s)]
*  He's a friend of mine. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2217.04s)]
*  But on the outside, he looks like he's your father. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2218.48s)]
*  He's the nicest total killer. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2220.88s)]
*  Because I asked him. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2225.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2226.56s)]
*  We're talking. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2228.02s)]
*  I did, they did a thing called Howdy Modi in Houston, Texas. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2228.74s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2232.5s)]
*  And they filled up the stadium. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2233.06s)]
*  It was me and him. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2234.42s)]
*  We filled up the stadium. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2235.54s)]
*  It was beautiful. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2236.5s)]
*  Like 80,000 people was going crazy. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2237.7s)]
*  Then we're walking around today. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2240.42s)]
*  Maybe I wouldn't be as, maybe you wouldn't do that. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2241.94s)]
*  We're walking in the middle, waving to everybody. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2245.2999999999997s)]
*  Anyway, but we have a very good relationship. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2248.58s)]
*  He's the nicest human being. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2251.7799999999997s)]
*  But we had a couple of occasions where somebody was threatening India. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2254.02s)]
*  I said, let me help. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2259.78s)]
*  I'm very good with those people. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2261.3s)]
*  Let me help. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2262.66s)]
*  I will do it. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2263.94s)]
*  I will do it. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2265.2200000000003s)]
*  Then I will do anything necessary. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2267.3s)]
*  We've defeated them for hundreds of years. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2269.46s)]
*  He was talking about a certain country. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2272.66s)]
*  You can probably guess. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2274.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2275.54s)]
*  I can't fathom which. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2276.66s)]
*  You know the country. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2277.2200000000003s)]
*  But I said, whoa, what happened there? [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2279.38s)]
*  They're all tough and they're all smart. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2284.9s)]
*  Some are very good people. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2287.62s)]
*  He's a good person. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2288.5s)]
*  There's some good people and some aren't good people. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2289.38s)]
*  They're all at the top of their game. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2291.94s)]
*  We have her who is now more important than him, I guess. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2294.7400000000002s)]
*  Although he's still president of this country. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2298.34s)]
*  We're talking about nuclear war. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2300.42s)]
*  He doesn't even know what it is. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2303.14s)]
*  He said yesterday when they talked about, should they hit Iran's nuclear? [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2304.7400000000002s)]
*  No, no, you shouldn't do that. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2310.82s)]
*  I said, no, it's sort of just the opposite. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2312.02s)]
*  Because the nuclear is the biggest threat we have in the world today. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2315.46s)]
*  It's not global warming where the oceans are rising one eighth of an inch in the next 500 years. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2319.86s)]
*  The threat that we have, the biggest threat is nuclear war. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2326.1s)]
*  You seem concerned about that. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2330.82s)]
*  I am because it only takes one. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2332.18s)]
*  I am. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2335.38s)]
*  They have five countries now that have capability. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2336.18s)]
*  And soon they'll have more. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2339.7s)]
*  And we shouldn't let there be more. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2341.62s)]
*  And I was at a point, very good, despite the Russia Russia Russia hoax, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2343.7799999999997s)]
*  it was a total hoax. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2347.46s)]
*  So we were totally exonerated and everything else. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2348.34s)]
*  I could have told them that the first day. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2350.58s)]
*  But that causes a lot of problems, a lot of problems. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2353.2999999999997s)]
*  And they're a big nuclear power. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2357.06s)]
*  We were close to a deal for getting rid of nuclear weapons. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2358.98s)]
*  It would be so good. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2364.1s)]
*  For all countries or just Russia? [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2365.62s)]
*  We were talking about Russia, ourselves and China. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2367.46s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2370.58s)]
*  And we would then bring everyone else into it. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2371.7s)]
*  So you all would get rid of your nuclear capabilities? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2374.98s)]
*  De-nuclearize, yes. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2379.14s)]
*  We were going to get totally denuclearized because it's too powerful. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2380.9s)]
*  It's too much. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2385.86s)]
*  You know, my uncle, Dr. John Trump was the country doctor. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2387.38s)]
*  Dr. John Trump. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2393.38s)]

*  someday it's very dangerous. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2409.8599999999997s)]
*  Somebody will be able to carry a small briefcase into a building in New York [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2412.02s)]

*  That will never happen. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2421.06s)]
*  He was like a really brilliant guy. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2423.06s)]
*  He was there for, I think, 41 years. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2424.66s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2450.18s)]
*  And she was great. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2450.42s)]
*  Is that where you get your humor from? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2452.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you what. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2453.7s)]
*  England at the time, they fought them for a thousand years trying to get them under [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2455.38s)]
*  toe. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2460.18s)]
*  They couldn't do it. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2460.5s)]
*  Couldn't do it. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2461.14s)]
*  They're very tough. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2461.7799999999997s)]
*  That reminds me of my mother. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2462.58s)]
*  Come to think of it. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2463.86s)]
*  My mother was great. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2466.58s)]
*  She was Stornoway, the Hebrides. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2467.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2470.34s)]
*  That's, you know, that's really serious Scottish. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2470.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2473.38s)]
*  But she was great. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2473.86s)]
*  But it is true when you see Braveheart. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2475.54s)]
*  That was one of many times, you know, for hundreds of years. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2478.34s)]
*  Did you watch that with your mom by any chance? [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2480.9s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2482.42s)]
*  I didn't get to. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2482.98s)]
*  I'll tell you, I saw Braveheart. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2483.86s)]
*  I think Mel Gibson is a very good guy. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2486.1800000000003s)]
*  I've met him a number of times. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2489.1400000000003s)]
*  Good guy. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2491.6200000000003s)]
*  But out there, that was super Mel Gibson in his prime. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2491.94s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2494.82s)]
*  So and I was on a plane and there was absolutely nothing to do. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2495.46s)]
*  It was one of these planes that you couldn't make calls. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2500.26s)]
*  You couldn't do it. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2502.82s)]
*  And they had tapes. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2503.94s)]
*  That's all planes for us. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2504.9s)]
*  And they showed me like they showed me. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2505.86s)]
*  They showed me, sir, we have 20 tapes. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2509.06s)]
*  I looked at the tapes and this was like 20 years after it was made. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2511.46s)]
*  This was probably six years ago. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2516.34s)]
*  I never saw Braveheart. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2519.2200000000003s)]
*  OK. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2520.5s)]
*  And they showed me a tape. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2520.98s)]
*  I say, all right, let's put that one on. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2523.3s)]
*  And within about four minutes, I said, this may be the greatest movie. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2525.62s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2528.7400000000002s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2530.42s)]
*  Within four minutes. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2531.14s)]
*  No, I'm a Braveheart fan. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2532.02s)]
*  But you've seen it. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2533.78s)]
*  Oh, I saw it with my mom. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2535.06s)]
*  She was emotional for like a week. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2536.66s)]
*  I wish I saw it with my mother. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2538.02s)]
*  But it was good. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2539.78s)]
*  Was that your Braveheart moment? [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2540.9s)]
*  Like after getting shot when you stood up? [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2542.02s)]
*  No, no. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2543.54s)]
*  Freedom. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2544.34s)]
*  You don't think of that in those moments. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2545.2200000000003s)]
*  You do what you do. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2546.98s)]
*  Thank God you weren't thinking about Mel Gibson. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2547.94s)]
*  No, but he's he's good. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2551.06s)]
*  But he was when he in prime time, he was unbelievable. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2552.26s)]
*  I mean, at that, you know, his look, his way, his and you couldn't have had a better guy playing it. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2555.54s)]
*  But it was that was a great movie. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2561.46s)]
*  So but it is to England and, you know, at the time, for a thousand years, [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2562.9s)]
*  they'd have and they'd have the battles with thousands or once a thousand. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2568.8999999999996s)]
*  And they run at each other. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2573.46s)]
*  Tell me that. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2574.58s)]
*  I think that takes guts. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2575.22s)]
*  They run at each other. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2577.22s)]
*  I think so. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2578.3399999999997s)]
*  Knowing they're going to pretty much die. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2578.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2580.5s)]
*  The Roman army built walls to keep out the scottish when they were up in England. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2580.74s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, they were afraid of the scottish. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2584.42s)]
*  They're afraid. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2586.18s)]
*  The scottish people, they're tough people. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2586.8999999999996s)]
*  They're good people. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2588.58s)]
*  Actually, they're very great people. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2589.46s)]
*  But they're good fighters. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2591.94s)]
*  But your mom was funny. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2592.8199999999997s)]

*  You know, they were married for polar opposites, though. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2600.98s)]
*  Yeah, my father was German. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2605.14s)]
*  Serious, serious, but good. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2608.02s)]
*  He was a tough guy, but he had a good heart. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2610.58s)]
*  When he walked down the street and they'll say we could walk down the street. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2613.46s)]
*  He would always give something to if there was somebody that had problems. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2617.3s)]
*  They used to have the can and a pencil. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2621.3s)]
*  You know, the can. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2623.2999999999997s)]

*  It was firm. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2636.8999999999996s)]
*  My mother was a woman. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2638.5s)]
*  And I don't know how your mother felt, but she loved the queen. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2639.62s)]
*  Don't forget the queen was, you know, the queen was great. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2642.8999999999996s)]
*  Oh, would she have liked because the queen honored me before she died. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2646.02s)]
*  She honored me as the president in Buckingham Palace. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2650.02s)]
*  And there's nobody that does it like the English. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2654.82s)]
*  There's nobody that has, you know, the pomp and ceremony. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2656.74s)]
*  But my mother would love that. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2660.5s)]
*  Your mother, so did she feel strongly about like the royalty? [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2663.94s)]
*  I think they're obsessed with the royal family out there, like in general. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2668.2599999999998s)]
*  Your mother would have been. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2671.86s)]
*  She was really into all the pageantry for sure. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2672.9s)]
*  My mother was. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2675.22s)]
*  My mother thought the queen was great. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2676.58s)]
*  Yeah, she thought the queen was so wonderful. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2678.34s)]
*  Some of my family hates the English, though. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2681.2200000000003s)]
*  I know. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2683.3s)]
*  There's some history there. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2683.94s)]
*  I know. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2684.9s)]

*  You know, they tried to break up Scotland from from the rest of the empire, so to speak. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2689.6200000000003s)]
*  Because they got some oil. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2694.34s)]
*  And it made it by about like a half a point. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2695.46s)]
*  Yeah, they kept it together. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2699.1400000000003s)]
*  So I hope it stays together. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2700.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it always stays together. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2702.34s)]
*  But England, as they say, because it used to be England. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2703.6200000000003s)]
*  But England never could they just and they were bigger. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2707.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2711.38s)]
*  And they had more people. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2711.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2712.9s)]
*  They could never finish it off by capturing Scotland. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2713.2200000000003s)]
*  So it's really sort of. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2716.98s)]
*  They ended up having to marry together. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2717.94s)]
*  They married. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2719.54s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2791.2200000000003s)]
*  But in my business, in what I do, if you don't have humor, you won't even survive. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2791.7s)]
*  Wait, why is that? [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2796.8199999999997s)]

*  I see political things that are hard. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2805.54s)]
*  We have a lot of corrupt people in this country and I see it. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2807.14s)]
*  And horrible, corrupt people. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2810.2599999999998s)]
*  We have people that, you know, I really do. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2812.66s)]
*  We have from the inside, we have really bad people and outside we do. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2815.7s)]
*  But I think the outside is, I think it's easier to handle China. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2820.34s)]
*  If you have a smart president who knows, you know, some things, if you had a who knows [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2823.7000000000003s)]
*  how to deal, let's say, you're not going to have a problem with Russia. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2829.94s)]
*  You're like Russia would have never attacked Ukraine if I were president. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2833.86s)]
*  I used to talk to Putin about it. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2837.3s)]
*  I got along great with him. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2839.46s)]
*  They would have never, ever done it. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2841.3s)]
*  I ended his pipeline. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2843.06s)]
*  You know, I ended the pipeline called Nord Stream 2. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2844.1000000000004s)]
*  Nobody ever heard of Nord Stream 2. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2847.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2848.98s)]
*  I said, are you building a pipeline going to Europe? [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2850.34s)]
*  I said, I don't think so. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2853.2200000000003s)]
*  And I told, you know, I got them together. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2854.98s)]
*  I said, you mean, we're defending you from Russia and you're paying them billions of [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2857.46s)]
*  dollars a month for oil. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2861.54s)]
*  It's not going to work that way. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2863.46s)]
*  And I ended it. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2864.7400000000002s)]
*  And then when Biden came in, he gave it back. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2865.86s)]
*  The biggest project they ever had, right? [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2868.6600000000003s)]
*  He gave it back. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2870.7400000000002s)]
*  And then everyone said, Trump is friends with Putin. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2871.54s)]
*  And so Putin would say, if you're my friend, I'd hate like hell to see you as my enemy. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2875.46s)]
*  Think of it. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2879.62s)]
*  And I put a lot of sanctions on. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2880.5s)]
*  But I got along with Russia. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2882.1s)]
*  I get along with pretty much everybody. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2883.2999999999997s)]
*  Actually, the tougher they were, the better I did with them. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2885.54s)]
*  That's a good thing, not a bad thing, because the other ones are easier to handle. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2890.18s)]
*  But the ones that I got along with, and they're also the bigger threats. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2893.7799999999997s)]
*  I got along very well with President Xi of China. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2897.7s)]
*  But when COVID came, I was not happy with him because it came out of the labs. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2900.66s)]
*  They released it from accidentally, I believe. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2906.34s)]
*  A lot of people would say it wasn't an accident, but they got hit very hard. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2909.06s)]
*  They got hit as hard as anybody in the world. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2913.1400000000003s)]
*  It was late. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2916.1s)]
*  It was belated. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2916.82s)]
*  It was a late hit. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2917.7000000000003s)]
*  But when COVID came, I made an unbelievable trade deal with China. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2919.38s)]
*  They have to buy $50 billion of our product every year. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2925.54s)]
*  Nobody could believe I got that deal done. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2930.34s)]
*  I don't even talk about it because of COVID. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2931.94s)]
*  I don't even talk about it. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2934.42s)]
*  That deal is unbelievable. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2935.7000000000003s)]
*  And what's happened now, our farmers have been hit because Biden hasn't [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2937.54s)]
*  pressed them to honor the deal. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2942.1800000000003s)]
*  I used to, every day I'd get up, how much did China buy today? [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2943.94s)]
*  I'd call them up and say, you're behind. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2948.98s)]
*  You have to buy $50 billion. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2950.98s)]
*  Do you think Biden does that? [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2952.7400000000002s)]
*  Biden's sleeping. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2953.94s)]
*  But over the last week, I have, we talk about funny or sad. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2956.02s)]
*  I think it's more sad than funny. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2960.34s)]
*  He has one ability I don't have. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2962.42s)]
*  He sleeps. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2965.14s)]
*  He can sleep. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2966.34s)]
*  This guy goes on a beat and he lays down on one of those, you know, six ounce, [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2967.86s)]

*  No, they're meant for children, young people, and old people to lift. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2978.7400000000002s)]
*  Aluminum, you know, hollowed aluminum. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2986.26s)]
*  They weigh very little and he can't lift. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2988.34s)]
*  And somebody convinced him he looks good in a bathing suit. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2990.7400000000002s)]
*  And when you're 82, typically bathing suits aren't going to make you look great, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2993.38s)]
*  you're not going to be enhanced. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2998.34s)]
*  All right? [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=2999.86s)]
*  It's just one of those things. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3000.1800000000003s)]
*  I can't be sure about that, but typically you don't. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3001.62s)]
*  Depends what he's packing. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3004.42s)]
*  He could. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3005.3s)]
*  I don't know what the hell he's packing, but I don't want to know either. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3005.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3009.78s)]
*  But he has an ability to fall asleep while on camera. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3010.9s)]
*  He can lie down on one of those things. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3015.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3017.46s)]
*  And in minutes, he's stone cold out. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3017.94s)]
*  How does he do it? [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3021.06s)]
*  He's got cameras on because he's the president, so they have cameras on him. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3021.8599999999997s)]
*  And then they show him sleeping on the beach. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3025.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3027.22s)]
*  You'll never see me sleeping in front of camera. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3028.2599999999998s)]
*  How do we get you better at that? [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3030.02s)]
*  What can we do? [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3031.7s)]
*  How do we work on that as a country? [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3032.4199999999996s)]
*  As a country? [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3035.06s)]
*  We're going to save our country. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3037.54s)]
*  We are a nation in decline, whether you like it or not. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3041.22s)]
*  I hate hearing that. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3044.8999999999996s)]
*  I know. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3045.8599999999997s)]
*  That hurts me. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3046.66s)]
*  That hurts me. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3047.14s)]
*  As a proud American, I... [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3047.7s)]
*  Well, what you like, though, is but we're going to be greater than ever before. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3049.7s)]
*  So that's, I think, the messaging that I think. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3053.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3055.62s)]
*  I think that's really nice to hear. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3055.8599999999997s)]
*  Well, that's my ultimate message. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3056.74s)]
*  But you can't avoid the fact that we've allowed 21 million people into our country in the last [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3058.18s)]
*  three and a half years. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3064.58s)]
*  And I don't know your persuasion. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3065.54s)]
*  I don't know if you guys are liberal or what, but nobody can be happy with 21 million people [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3067.3799999999997s)]
*  openly walking into our place. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3071.7799999999997s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3073.14s)]
*  And it was released last week that 13,000 of those people are murderers. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3073.8599999999997s)]
*  13,099. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3079.7s)]
*  13,000 of those people are in prison. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3081.7799999999997s)]
*  They're incarcerated for murder and they let them out. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3085.14s)]
*  I think you have support on this, though. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3088.2599999999998s)]
*  I think everybody... [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3089.7s)]
*  Tremendous support. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3090.18s)]
*  Regardless... [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3091.14s)]
*  I think I'll let you know on November 6th if I have support. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3091.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3096.58s)]
*  But I don't think... [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3096.98s)]
*  The day after the election. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3097.22s)]
*  November 5th. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3098.3399999999997s)]
*  The most important day. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3099.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3100.66s)]
*  I think people are agreeing they want a strong border. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3101.06s)]
*  And I think... [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3103.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't think that's an issue that's like tearing the country apart. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3103.9399999999996s)]
*  But I do think that there is something that... [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3106.58s)]
*  There are some people that want open and they're either... [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3108.34s)]
*  But they're like politicians that are getting some sort of reinforcement through this. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3111.38s)]
*  The average American, I don't think, is going, we need an open border. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3114.82s)]
*  I think only a person that hates our country, actually, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3118.82s)]
*  maybe it's a down deep hatred, can want open borders. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3121.94s)]
*  So we took in more than 21 million people in the last three and a half years. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3126.5s)]
*  And we have no idea where they even come from. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3130.82s)]
*  They're terrorists, they're drug dealers. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3133.1400000000003s)]
*  You know, in Venezuela, and it's not just South America, [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3135.3s)]
*  particularly Venezuela. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3137.7799999999997s)]
*  They've taken their criminals off the streets of Caracas, [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3139.06s)]
*  which was a very dangerous city. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3141.9399999999996s)]
*  You couldn't walk across the street in Caracas and get a loaf of bread. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3143.7799999999997s)]
*  Right now, it's a safe city. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3148.5s)]
*  Their crime is down 72%. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3150.2599999999998s)]
*  They've taken all of their criminals, almost all of them, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3152.2599999999998s)]
*  and they brought them into the United States and dumped them. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3155.46s)]
*  That's not ending well. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3158.58s)]
*  You know, where some of them went to Aurora in Colorado. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3159.7799999999997s)]
*  And they took over the town. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3163.62s)]
*  They took it over... [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3165.3799999999997s)]
*  The whole town? [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3166.1s)]
*  Pretty much, yeah. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3167.46s)]
*  You know how they took it over with guns? [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3168.9s)]
*  They went into the real estate business like me. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3170.82s)]
*  I had to go to a bank and borrow. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3172.9s)]
*  They went in with MK-47. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3174.98s)]
*  So they went in with weapons like nobody's ever seen before. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3177.54s)]
*  They went in with military style weapons. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3185.2200000000003s)]
*  They've taken it over. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3187.06s)]
*  I think most people are on board with deporting any illegal that has committed a crime. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3188.1800000000003s)]
*  I think there is bipartisan support of that. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3193.94s)]
*  I think the tricky thing comes, and honestly, I have empathy. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3196.02s)]
*  You're a business owner. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3198.42s)]
*  There's been people... [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3199.22s)]
*  I'm not trying to out you, but there's been people, I'm sure, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3200.98s)]
*  that might not have had legal citizenship that have maybe worked in various businesses. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3203.06s)]
*  I've definitely been taken care of as a kid by people that weren't legal, babysitters and stuff. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3208.98s)]
*  So there are people that maybe would like a path to citizenship that I have a lot of empathy for. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3212.58s)]
*  You have to start with the criminals. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3217.54s)]
*  Agreed. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3218.98s)]
*  Okay. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3219.46s)]
*  It's very tough. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3222.2599999999998s)]
*  Maybe we can open our hearts a little bit to the people who are trying to be good hardworking Americans. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3222.98s)]
*  You know what's going to happen? [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3227.3s)]
*  You're going to be in the midst of this. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3228.18s)]
*  Dwight Eisenhower was sort of a moderate, General Eisenhower. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3229.94s)]
*  Did you know that they had 8% generals, president of the United States, [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3233.22s)]
*  8% were generals, 92% were politicians, and then you had Trump? [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3239.06s)]
*  See, that's a wave. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3245.3s)]
*  We go off into the streets. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3246.42s)]
*  Because now I'm like, where are we weaving to? [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3248.26s)]
*  I'm into this. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3249.78s)]
*  No, no, think of it. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3250.5s)]
*  Because we're talking about generals and then you get back onto the general. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3251.3s)]
*  There you go. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3254.42s)]
*  Because what I was going to say is that Eisenhower is a moderate. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3254.9s)]
*  I like to play by play for the weak. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3258.42s)]
*  No, it's good though. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3260.1800000000003s)]
*  Isn't it great? [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3260.7400000000002s)]
*  We're going to mention Eisenhower and then I say he was a general, 8% generals, 92% and now you go back. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3261.2200000000003s)]
*  Okay, it's part of the weave. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3268.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3269.86s)]
*  Then you go back. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3270.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3271.0600000000004s)]
*  You got to keep it all together. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3271.6200000000003s)]
*  You got to be sharp. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3273.3s)]
*  If you're not sharp, you're dead. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3274.5s)]
*  Think of it. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3277.54s)]
*  No, but think of it. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3278.5s)]
*  So we have 92% and 8%. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3279.7s)]
*  No admirals and no business people until me. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3283.06s)]
*  So now we have me. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3285.62s)]
*  I'm one. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3286.3399999999997s)]
*  And then maybe things change after that. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3288.2599999999998s)]

*  There'll never be another business person that ever does this. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3292.58s)]
*  Okay, here's the question. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3295.14s)]
*  Because I've been treated so badly that I think that no person of success, [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3295.8599999999997s)]
*  don't forget my whole life was deals, deals, deals, deals, deals, deals. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3299.9399999999996s)]

*  There's no deal. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3307.06s)]
*  There's no nothing. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3307.7799999999997s)]
*  You can't get yourself in trouble much. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3308.5s)]
*  You can be a crooked politician, some are. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3310.66s)]
*  But basically, I do so many deals. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3313.22s)]
*  I do hundreds of thousands of pages of documents a year, [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3315.22s)]
*  you know, when I'm really in the mood, right? [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3319.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3322.02s)]
*  They find one page. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3322.98s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3326.42s)]
*  Okay, look at it. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3326.82s)]
*  They went after me for years on taxes. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3328.02s)]
*  Years. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3331.22s)]
*  They went to the United States Supreme Court. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3332.1s)]
*  I gave them tens of thousands of pages. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3334.26s)]
*  And you never heard about it again. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3338.34s)]
*  Well, that is what often happens, [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3340.1800000000003s)]
*  which is probably incredibly frustrating, [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3341.46s)]
*  which is lobbying an allegation. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3343.1400000000003s)]
*  And then when it's proven to be false, they just move on. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3345.3s)]
*  Oh, they don't even write about it. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3349.1400000000003s)]
*  I called the New York Times on something. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3350.5s)]
*  I was right. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3352.1800000000003s)]

*  It was wild. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3354.26s)]
*  Yeah, the Russian hooks. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3354.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3355.86s)]
*  Well, I'm suing Pulitzer. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3356.34s)]
*  You don't know this. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3358.02s)]
*  They got a Pulitzer Prize for their New York Times. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3359.86s)]
*  For the hooks? [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3362.42s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3363.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, for the hooks. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3363.86s)]
*  They got the Pulitzer Prize. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3365.1400000000003s)]
*  So the writers got Pulitzer Prizes for their brilliant coverage [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3366.6600000000003s)]
*  of the Russia, Russia, Russia hooks. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3370.7400000000002s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3372.34s)]
*  It turned out to be right. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3372.98s)]
*  So we wrote a letter to the Pulitzer Prize, right? [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3374.0200000000004s)]
*  You know, the committee, it's a big foundation. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3377.5400000000004s)]
*  And we said, it's a lawsuit that's going on right now. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3380.1000000000004s)]
*  And we said, we demanded you take back the Pulitzer Prizes. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3383.3s)]
*  We demand an apology. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3386.0200000000004s)]
*  Because you're actually, by leaving them, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3388.26s)]
*  you're sort of saying it happened. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3389.78s)]
*  And it didn't have everybody now is giving it up. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3391.78s)]
*  Yeah, you're rewarding the lie. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3393.3s)]
*  So I sued them. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3395.2200000000003s)]
*  They said, well, we did what we did. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3396.98s)]
*  We're not, OK, that's OK. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3399.78s)]
*  That's all right. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3400.82s)]
*  So I sued them. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3401.54s)]
*  And they've got themselves a big problem now. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3402.7400000000002s)]
*  And this suit's moving along. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3404.82s)]
*  And I think we're going to win that suit easily. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3406.26s)]
*  Because they gave people Pulitzer Prizes that were wrong. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3408.34s)]
*  You know, as you get the Pulitzer Prizes, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3412.1000000000004s)]
*  equivalent, if you could, guys like Sean Hannity, guys like, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3413.7000000000003s)]
*  there were numerous of them. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3417.7000000000003s)]
*  That, I mean, not as many as the fake news, [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3419.06s)]
*  as the very liberal media. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3422.26s)]
*  But we had tremendous John Solomon. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3424.2599999999998s)]
*  He's a great writer. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3426.74s)]
*  So many people knew that that was a hoax. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3427.94s)]
*  They should get prizes. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3431.46s)]
*  I don't know, Pulitzer Prize, because you don't give [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3432.66s)]
*  Pulitzer Prizes to a guy on television. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3434.18s)]
*  You can't get, in theory, a Pulitzer Prize. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3436.2599999999998s)]
*  But you had a lot of people that got that right. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3438.2599999999998s)]
*  They got nothing. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3440.2599999999998s)]
*  So we sued Pulitzer on the basis that they should [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3441.3799999999997s)]
*  absolutely take that prize back. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3444.74s)]
*  And I said, by not taking it back, [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3447.7s)]
*  you're trying to say that it actually happened, you know, [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3449.22s)]
*  in a way. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3451.3799999999997s)]
*  I'm saying you're defaming me because by you not taking [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3452.42s)]

*  I asked Alex. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3647.62s)]
*  He's an influencer. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3648.42s)]
*  You know, he's a very- [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3649.2999999999997s)]
*  He's a big name influencer. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3650.8199999999997s)]
*  I don't know if he's in this league. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3652.58s)]
*  I don't know who the hell is. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3653.8599999999997s)]
*  But I said to him, knowing nothing about influencers, I said, [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3655.46s)]
*  who is the biggest of all the influencers, sir? [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3659.62s)]
*  That's the easiest question you've ever asked me. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3662.1s)]
*  Who is it? [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3664.5s)]
*  You, sir. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3665.54s)]
*  That's true. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3666.1s)]
*  Wow. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3666.8199999999997s)]
*  I said, no. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3667.06s)]
*  I never thought of it. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3668.02s)]
*  He said, you're the biggest. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3669.46s)]
*  You have hundreds of millions of people. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3670.58s)]
*  You have more people than anybody else by far. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3673.2999999999997s)]
*  You know, before they took away- [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3675.2999999999997s)]
*  I went from having 280 million on Facebook and Twitter and Instagram, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3676.58s)]
*  the three of them combined, 280, I think I was number one, [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3684.2599999999998s)]
*  because Zuckerberg told me that. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3687.46s)]
*  He came to the White House. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3688.66s)]
*  He said, congratulations, you're number one on Facebook. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3690.2599999999998s)]
*  So I went from that to having nobody. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3693.22s)]
*  That was like cold turkey, right? [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3698.8199999999997s)]
*  You'd call that cold turkey. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3700.74s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3701.94s)]
*  That would be like if we didn't do business with China. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3702.42s)]
*  One day I said, no more business with China. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3704.42s)]
*  You go cold turkey, right? [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3706.98s)]
*  And I went and I said, boy, but I had a lot to say. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3708.82s)]
*  This was after the presidency, of course. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3712.98s)]
*  They do it after the presidency. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3714.9s)]
*  During the presidency, they're a little bit- [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3716.66s)]
*  They're very nice. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3718.1s)]
*  But anyway, I went totally, totally off. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3718.58s)]
*  I had nobody and I had all these ideas. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3723.46s)]
*  And I couldn't get the word out and I had some good thoughts [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3726.66s)]
*  and people wanted to hear my thoughts. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3730.5s)]
*  And I did a thing called Save America. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3732.34s)]
*  And essentially it was like the old fashioned- [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3736.02s)]
*  You guys are far too young. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3738.1000000000004s)]
*  In the old days, what we did, we didn't have tweeting [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3739.5400000000004s)]
*  or we didn't have truth. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3742.1000000000004s)]
*  Truth is doing great, by the way. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3743.2200000000003s)]
*  Would you please use truth? [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3744.42s)]
*  I love truth. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3745.5400000000004s)]
*  Use truth, everybody. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3746.26s)]
*  It's my voice. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3747.2200000000003s)]
*  But I also use X. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3748.42s)]
*  I also use X. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3750.1800000000003s)]
*  But I went from having all these people [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3751.46s)]
*  and I did an old fashioned press release. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3754.82s)]
*  It's called- [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3757.6200000000003s)]
*  We used to go to press releases. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3758.1000000000004s)]
*  And somebody would write up something. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3759.94s)]
*  And send it to all the- [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3762.9s)]
*  I started doing it, Save America. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3764.02s)]
*  And they got longer and better and longer. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3766.5800000000004s)]
*  And I started doing it. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3769.0600000000004s)]
*  And man, I had millions of people. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3770.1800000000003s)]
*  Now, nobody else could do that because if somebody puts out [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3773.38s)]
*  a press release, it just doesn't work out too well. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3775.94s)]
*  But I did it and it did well. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3778.6600000000003s)]
*  And then I did truth. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3780.82s)]
*  And I'm very good friends with Elon. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3783.0600000000004s)]
*  And we owe Elon a lot for what he's done with X. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3784.6600000000003s)]
*  And I use X, too. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3787.94s)]
*  I use X, too. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3788.74s)]
*  But my voice is on truth. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3790.58s)]
*  And it's done really well. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3792.9799999999996s)]
*  I mean, if I want to get something out, [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3794.2599999999998s)]
*  I put it on truth and everybody picks it up. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3796.5s)]
*  You know, everybody picks it up. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3798.74s)]
*  You put it there and then you see other people- [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3799.54s)]
*  No, it's picked up all over the place. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3800.9799999999996s)]
*  It's picked up. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3802.2599999999998s)]
*  I could be on anything I want. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3803.14s)]
*  But I put it out on truth and it just gets picked up [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3804.9799999999996s)]
*  all over the place. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3808.2599999999998s)]
*  So it's been very good. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3808.9799999999996s)]
*  But he said I was the number one influencer. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3810.58s)]
*  See? [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3812.74s)]
*  The weave. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3813.54s)]
*  The weave is great. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3814.1s)]
*  Okay, question, question. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3814.9799999999996s)]
*  Okay, you've got your son, Barron. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3815.8599999999997s)]
*  Do you think I'm the number one influencer? [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3818.18s)]
*  I think it's Rogan. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3819.7799999999997s)]
*  I think it's Rogan, you and Kim Kardashian. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3822.8199999999997s)]
*  Like, Kim Kardashian influences the shape of women's bodies and faces. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3826.98s)]
*  Like, you see so many, like, their literal shape of human beings. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3831.54s)]
*  Do they want to look like her? [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3835.22s)]
*  They want to look like her. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3836.8999999999996s)]
*  So once we start seeing dudes want to look like you. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3838.1s)]
*  And I see young Jack over there. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3841.94s)]
*  I think he's trying to do it. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3843.2999999999997s)]

*  You know, this is a little new world. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3849.46s)]
*  I call him, his name is Jack. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3850.98s)]
*  I call him TikTok Jack. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3852.4199999999996s)]
*  I'm good with names, you know. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3853.7799999999997s)]
*  You are. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3854.8199999999997s)]
*  You're very good. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3855.3799999999997s)]
*  You are. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3856.18s)]
*  Pocahontas. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3856.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3857.46s)]
*  We have names. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3858.4199999999996s)]
*  What about, and there was, you, Tampon Tim was good. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3859.22s)]
*  What about, is that? [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3862.02s)]
*  The problem with Tampon Tim, it's hard to say. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3862.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3864.98s)]
*  In other words. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3865.3799999999997s)]
*  It's a mouthful. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3865.9399999999996s)]
*  It's a lot. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3866.8999999999996s)]
*  And you can't stutter it through when you follow it. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3868.58s)]
*  It's really a lousy word to say. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3872.3399999999997s)]
*  But it's quite accurate, right? [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3875.06s)]
*  There are some like Comrade Kamala. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3877.3799999999997s)]
*  It's a little hard to say. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3882.4199999999996s)]
*  She's Comrade because she's obviously a communist. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3883.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3885.9399999999996s)]
*  She's horrible. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3886.4199999999996s)]
*  So I call her Comrade. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3887.7s)]
*  And it's not bad. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3889.4599999999996s)]
*  But when you put the names together, it's a little, [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3891.06s)]
*  you got to be able to pew. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3894.1s)]
*  Well, you got to be able to put it out there. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3897.62s)]
*  But we have a lot of good ones. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3900.4199999999996s)]
*  A lot of them I can't go into with you because some of my best ones. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3901.62s)]
*  Give me some. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3905.14s)]
*  Some of my best ones are from the Republican primaries. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3905.62s)]
*  They're all friends of mine now. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3909.94s)]
*  What about Mike Pence? [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3913.14s)]
*  You got anything for Mike Pence? [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3913.8599999999997s)]
*  Well, it's a shame because he and I had a very good relationship. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3914.9s)]
*  He couldn't cross the line of doing what was right, in my opinion. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3920.98s)]
*  Some people would disagree with that. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3924.5s)]
*  But he had the right to go and put them before the legislatures and have them [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3926.5s)]
*  reassess because they found out a lot of bad things. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3931.94s)]
*  And he had a lawyer that said he didn't have that right, but he did have that right. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3934.18s)]
*  And you know why we found out that that was true? [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3937.54s)]
*  Because they changed the law after the election so that he couldn't do what I said he could do. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3939.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3944.3399999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3944.74s)]
*  They changed the law so that a vice president could no longer do what I said he could do. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3945.22s)]
*  So in other words, I turned out to be right. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3951.7s)]
*  But it's a shame. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3954.02s)]
*  We had a very good relationship for 99.9% of the thing. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3955.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3959.7799999999997s)]
*  And you know, I think he's a good man. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3960.3399999999997s)]
*  I mean, I think he's a good man. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3962.1s)]
*  I wish he would have had the stamina, maybe courage, maybe both to go further because we have to have [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3963.38s)]
*  honest elections in our country. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3973.0600000000004s)]
*  And if we're afraid to challenge an election, we're in big trouble. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3974.7400000000002s)]
*  You know, they say if you tell they've challenged elections to Democrats. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3978.1800000000003s)]
*  Look at Maxine Waters. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3982.98s)]
*  How dare that? [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3984.1800000000003s)]
*  You know, they've challenged Stacey Abrams almost all the time. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3985.1400000000003s)]
*  Stacey Abrams. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3990.2599999999998s)]
*  Almost all of the Democrats challenge. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3992.58s)]
*  But when we challenge, they say he's a threat to democracy. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3994.8999999999996s)]
*  These are con artists and they're very bad for our country. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=3998.5s)]
*  So I'm going to weed them out. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4001.7799999999997s)]
*  I'm going to weed them out. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4003.14s)]
*  I'll do it in honor of you. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4004.02s)]
*  Okay. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4005.46s)]
*  So tell me this. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4006.02s)]
*  So tell me this situation. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4006.98s)]
*  Okay. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4008.74s)]
*  Barron is 18. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4010.02s)]
*  He's handsome. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4010.98s)]
*  He's tall. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4011.7799999999997s)]
*  He's rich. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4012.8999999999996s)]
*  He's got the whole ball. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4013.62s)]
*  He's unleashed in New York City. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4014.98s)]
*  Are you sure you want to reverse Roe v. Wade now? [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4017.8599999999997s)]
*  I mean, maybe give him a few years. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4022.66s)]
*  It's up to the states now. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4025.22s)]
*  It's up to the states because I have and I believe in exceptions and all of the different things. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4026.58s)]
*  You've been vocal about that. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4030.8199999999997s)]
*  I've been very well. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4031.9399999999996s)]
*  Would you try to influence? [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4032.5s)]
*  I think a lot of people agree with me. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4033.54s)]
*  I was very, very strong, very, very tough. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4036.4199999999996s)]
*  And Republicans were going to lose a lot of elections having to do with a lot of other [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4040.4199999999996s)]
*  things too because there are many issues. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4044.4199999999996s)]
*  We have the border. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4045.8599999999997s)]
*  We have this. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4046.5s)]
*  We have wars. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4047.14s)]
*  We have everything. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4047.78s)]
*  And Roe v. Wade was always about getting it back to the states. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4049.54s)]
*  And then people started talking about the number of weeks and this, that all these. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4053.78s)]
*  But nobody wanted no legal scholar, no Democrat, no Republican, liberal, conservative. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4057.22s)]
*  Nobody wanted it in the federal government. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4062.42s)]
*  It shouldn't be in the federal government. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4064.74s)]
*  And the legal scholars, it was a parent. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4066.26s)]
*  They didn't want it and they didn't want it in the federal government. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4069.3s)]
*  No. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4072.82s)]
*  And it was in the federal government. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4073.14s)]
*  I know you said this. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4074.34s)]
*  What we did is what we did is we moved it back to the states and a vote of the people. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4075.14s)]
*  And now they're voting. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4081.22s)]
*  Ohio voted a very liberal, you know, Ohio. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4082.1s)]
*  I won Ohio by a lot, but they, they voted and it's up to them. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4085.22s)]
*  Okay. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4090.18s)]
*  I do believe in exceptions. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4091.06s)]
*  Life of the mother and incest. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4093.22s)]
*  If your daughter's by somebody, let's say he's from a prison someplace and he's killed people [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4096.26s)]
*  and everything else. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4103.22s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4104.9800000000005s)]
*  You have to be able to do. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4105.780000000001s)]
*  There are some people and I think that group is smaller and smaller when they realize what's [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4107.7s)]
*  going on. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4112.1s)]
*  But there are some people that under no circumstances can you do. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4113.06s)]
*  I don't happen to agree. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4118.5s)]
*  Ronald Reagan didn't agree. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4119.38s)]
*  But what has happened is it's now back in the states where it belongs and the states [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4120.900000000001s)]
*  are moving along and they're approving things. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4125.860000000001s)]
*  Some conservative and some liberal. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4129.62s)]
*  There's a, there's a, there are some places, my wife and I had a baby with through IVF [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4131.14s)]
*  and you've been very supportive of IVF. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4137.14s)]

*  When the government. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4144.900000000001s)]
*  But I actually said we want babies in our country. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4146.02s)]
*  And we do. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4148.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4149.46s)]
*  But there are some people using that reversal of Roe v Wade to kind of attack the legality [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4149.860000000001s)]
*  of IVF. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4157.46s)]
*  And to me, it's like that's heartbreaking. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4158.34s)]
*  These are crooked politicians. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4160.18s)]
*  These are politicians. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4161.9400000000005s)]
*  Now I'll give you an example. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4163.700000000001s)]
*  I came out when it first came up and it started in Alabama where a judge ruled that you couldn't [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4165.14s)]
*  do IVF and all clinics and all over Alabama was going to shut down. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4171.780000000001s)]
*  We're going to be shut down. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4175.54s)]
*  And I wasn't an expert on IVF, but I have common sense, you know, with a party of common sense. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4177.62s)]
*  And some women called me and actually Katie Britt called me the senator from Alabama was [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4183.62s)]
*  really a young, good politician, smart, great husband. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4187.94s)]
*  It was a football player, great family. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4191.46s)]
*  She called me up. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4193.54s)]
*  She said, sir, women have come to me and almost attacked me and then my best friends [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4194.179999999999s)]
*  that the judge shut down IVF. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4201.54s)]
*  He's a very conservative judge and he shut down IVF. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4203.78s)]
*  And I said, let's explain it. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4208.5s)]
*  Tell me. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4210.339999999999s)]
*  And she told me, I said, no, it's a great thing. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4211.299999999999s)]
*  It's helping women have babies. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4214.74s)]
*  And she didn't know her friends were all going through IVF. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4217.38s)]
*  It's so much more common than people realize. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4220.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4222.66s)]
*  But they don't talk about it. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4223.219999999999s)]
*  Let's say somebody's doing it. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4224.42s)]
*  I understand. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4225.62s)]
*  I never had big discussions. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4226.58s)]
*  I know this. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4228.26s)]
*  If you're a woman and you're not going to be telling Katie Britt and you're not going [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4229.3s)]
*  to be telling your friends, hey, I'm going through IVF. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4233.139999999999s)]
*  Some will and some won't. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4236.0199999999995s)]
*  But she didn't know anything about her friends and they were good friends of hers. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4237.86s)]
*  She said, they're literally attacking me. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4240.9s)]
*  I said, well, what is it? [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4243.7s)]
*  After about five minutes, I'm a quick study. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4245.7s)]
*  I said, that's a great thing. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4248.0199999999995s)]
*  And I came out within 45 minutes of the decision. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4250.34s)]
*  I came out strongly in favor on behalf of the Republican Party. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4254.9s)]
*  And I have calls from senators saying, thank you, sir. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4259.86s)]
*  You saved my political career. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4262.74s)]
*  Wow. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4264.179999999999s)]
*  Because they might have come out. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4264.66s)]
*  Saving their family, too. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4266.42s)]
*  But here's what does happen, which is really we get calls that just the other day [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4267.54s)]
*  that this total lying politician that's running that ruined San Francisco, [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4274.26s)]
*  she destroyed San Francisco with her very liberal policies and she destroyed the state. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4279.38s)]
*  Gavin Newsom? [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4284.5s)]
*  No, it's her. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4285.38s)]
*  But Gavin Newsom, I call him Gavin Newscom. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4286.82s)]
*  That's a good one. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4290.34s)]
*  No, he's a terrible. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4291.14s)]
*  He was terrible. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4292.02s)]
*  That was Pheum. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4292.5s)]
*  He doesn't like that. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4297.06s)]
*  But he is. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4298.34s)]
*  Good hair, though. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4298.9800000000005s)]
*  Gavin, he probably does. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4299.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4301.62s)]
*  Yeah, he is nice. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4302.12s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4302.74s)]
*  You is? [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4303.38s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4304.179999999999s)]
*  So good. I don't know. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4304.679999999999s)]
*  Pretty good. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4305.46s)]
*  You're well something. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4306.099999999999s)]
*  Don't take your hat off, people. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4306.82s)]
*  You never know. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4309.62s)]
*  Sometimes the guy will take his hat off, he has good hair, he'll say boy you are. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4310.26s)]
*  And usually it's Paul. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4314.42s)]
*  95% of the time. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4316.34s)]
*  There's always a reason. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4317.86s)]
*  Usually a reason, and that's OK, too. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4320.0199999999995s)]
*  But what I do, I get a call and they say that she, Kamala, said that I'm against [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4324.5s)]
*  IVF, OK, that I'm against it. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4332.34s)]
*  They know it's untrue. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4334.34s)]
*  But all of the lies are fake. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4336.26s)]
*  So many different things. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4338.66s)]
*  The bloodbath. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4340.74s)]
*  That was about the auto industry, but the word is a tough word. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4342.82s)]
*  China is going to take all our auto business if we go all electric and all this stuff. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4346.1s)]
*  And the head of the union, I said, is a fool. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4349.54s)]
*  He sold the union down. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4352.18s)]
*  I'm doing great with it. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4353.3s)]
*  You notice where the teamsters like me and they all like me. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4354.18s)]
*  The workers like me because I'm going to preach. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4356.82s)]
*  It seems to be that way. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4358.74s)]
*  Yeah, it seems to be. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4359.62s)]
*  Even unions that have never been with a Republican before are endorsing me. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4361.06s)]
*  I mean, it's incredible. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4366.34s)]
*  The teamsters voted 61% in favor of Trump. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4367.38s)]
*  Think of that. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4370.74s)]
*  I'll tell you, the FBI would be in favor. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4373.14s)]
*  Almost everybody, I think almost everybody would be in favor. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4374.9s)]
*  But they lie and they say, and they know it's a lie. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4378.18s)]
*  Charlottesville. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4382.34s)]
*  The Charlottesville statement was perfect. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4383.46s)]
*  If they take the next sentence that I gave, I made a statement on it. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4386.18s)]
*  It was a perfect statement. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4389.54s)]
*  And if you take, but they never take the next sentence. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4391.38s)]
*  They cut it off. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4393.38s)]
*  And then there's no accountability. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4394.0199999999995s)]
*  Even the other one, peacefully and patriotically. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4394.5s)]
*  In my speech, I talked about peacefully and patriotically. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4399.54s)]
*  They never show that. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4405.38s)]
*  They never talk about it. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4407.06s)]
*  To show you how dishonest they are, the J6 committee, I call it the unselect. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4408.66s)]
*  You know, they call it the select committee. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4413.94s)]
*  I call it the unselect committee of political acts and thugs. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4415.54s)]
*  They never talk about my speech because it was a good speech. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4420.74s)]
*  It was a patriotic speech. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4423.86s)]
*  Are you numb to this now or does it still bother you? [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4425.62s)]
*  No, it bothers me. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4428.9s)]
*  I'll tell you what bothers me. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4429.94s)]
*  Kamala the other day said, he is against IVF. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4431.46s)]
*  And everybody knows that that's false. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4436.18s)]
*  When I came out, people were a little surprised actually, because you know, in theory. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4439.22s)]
*  But I came out strongly in favor of IVF. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4443.780000000001s)]
*  She is an add-on that I'm against IVF. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4447.06s)]
*  She knows it's untrue. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4449.860000000001s)]
*  She is an add-on that bloodbathed. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4450.820000000001s)]
*  Bloodbath means like blood. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4453.38s)]
*  And that's not what I was talking about. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4454.58s)]
*  The automobile industry. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4456.9800000000005s)]
*  It's going to be a bloodbath in the automobile. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4458.18s)]
*  We're going to lose all our business. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4460.02s)]
*  That's what she's referring to. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4462.18s)]
*  When they do things, and they do a lot, but I always refer them back to the simplicity of McDonald's. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4463.9400000000005s)]
*  She lied about McDonald's. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4469.22s)]
*  She lied about many things. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4470.5s)]
*  And she's a liar. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4472.58s)]
*  There should be some kind of a rule when they know it's a lie, you can't do a commercial on it. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4474.26s)]
*  But this is a thing that's going to end in 29 days so they can say what they want. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4480.0199999999995s)]
*  I have a hard time doing it to them because I'm basically a truthful person. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4484.5s)]
*  She's given me so much ammunition. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4496.66s)]
*  I don't really have to. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4498.26s)]
*  She's a radical left lunatic. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4499.9400000000005s)]
*  Who will destroy our nation other than that? [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4502.42s)]
*  But she will destroy our nation. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4505.14s)]
*  So when you take a look at it, and I think that just getting back to your original thought on [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4506.740000000001s)]
*  having it back in the states, the people are now voting on it. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4514.02s)]
*  And we're going to put an end to a 52-year ordeal. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4517.14s)]
*  This has been going on for 52 years. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4521.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4523.38s)]
*  It's back with the states and it's a vote of the people. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4524.18s)]
*  And that's where everybody wanted it to be. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4528.34s)]
*  And I think that issue is largely quelled because of that. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4530.74s)]
*  You've said like Arizona, you think went a little bit too far. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4534.26s)]
*  If you feel a state goes a little bit too far, will you use a little influence and say, [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4536.98s)]
*  hey, maybe we can make exceptions? [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4540.34s)]
*  Oh, no, I won't back it. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4542.26s)]
*  I think that's important for moderates to hear. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4545.78s)]
*  That's what I want to give you that. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4547.3s)]
*  I won't back it. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4548.179999999999s)]
*  Some states say no wings. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4549.0599999999995s)]
*  But they're all changing because the people in the state won't stand for that. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4551.22s)]
*  There are some states that say under no circumstances you have a daughter and she's [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4555.86s)]
*  by the worst, most violent criminal in the country and you cannot get her. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4562.42s)]
*  You cannot take her answer. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4569.299999999999s)]
*  She has to live with that for the rest of her life. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4570.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4572.179999999999s)]
*  She's got to live with this. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4572.58s)]
*  And the father is a monster. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4574.099999999999s)]
*  He's from an insane asylum because he killed 50 people. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4576.98s)]
*  And you're going to have that baby. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4581.139999999999s)]
*  And I can't believe. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4582.98s)]
*  You have to have empathy for that. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4583.78s)]
*  No, no, I can't believe that people are forced to do that. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4584.9s)]
*  And you have a tiny, you know, right now it was it used to be a much bigger segment. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4588.82s)]
*  No, I think I've done a good job in a lot of ways because I've convinced people that [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4594.74s)]
*  you just can't do that. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4597.94s)]
*  That's important. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4598.9s)]
*  It's always been complex. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4599.46s)]
*  It's always been tough. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4600.66s)]
*  But we've come a long way with that issue. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4601.94s)]
*  But just in a nutshell, bringing it back to the states and giving a vote of the people [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4604.42s)]
*  is where they wanted it 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4610.34s)]
*  And then they got a little complex. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4616.58s)]
*  They talked about the length and the, you know, the number with protections, [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4618.02s)]
*  with protections for women. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4621.38s)]
*  To me, you have to Ronald Reagan a long time ago was with the same three protections. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4623.54s)]
*  He said he wanted, you know, for incest and the life of the mother. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4627.9400000000005s)]
*  And that was a long time ago. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4634.18s)]
*  OK, you have a very busy day. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4636.34s)]
*  Before you go, what would you like your legacy to be? [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4637.54s)]
*  And what do you think it will be? [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4644.26s)]
*  So and thank you very much for taking two very different questions, actually, I think. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4646.9s)]
*  But what would you like it to be? [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4650.42s)]
*  I took over a country that was very troubled. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4652.74s)]
*  This country was broken up and tremendous dissension. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4654.98s)]
*  And Barack Obama started it. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4660.82s)]
*  And if you take a look, it was very, very badly broken. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4663.14s)]
*  And I think now with with Biden, you know, let's forget her for a second. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4667.22s)]
*  But with Biden and her part of it, big part of it. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4671.22s)]
*  But with Biden, there's tremendous dissension. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4674.820000000001s)]
*  The country is a broken up mess. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4677.62s)]
*  And it's broken in a lot of ways. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4682.34s)]
*  But what I would like my legacy to be is the same as the term MAGA, [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4684.34s)]
*  make America great again. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4690.740000000001s)]
*  I'm going to make this country great again. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4692.58s)]
*  It's not a great country right now. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4694.18s)]
*  It's loaded up. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4695.78s)]
*  It's always a great country. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4696.42s)]
*  It's a great. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4697.38s)]
*  See, that's always a great country. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4697.94s)]
*  OK, but I say it has the potential and it was a great country. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4699.46s)]
*  I think now there's so much hatred and there's so much dissension. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4704.0199999999995s)]
*  I think when you have people that can't walk down Fifth Avenue, [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4708.42s)]
*  when you have people that can't walk down a street, it ceases to be. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4711.86s)]
*  We can always be better. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4715.3s)]
*  We can always be better. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4716.66s)]
*  Yeah, but you can't blindfold yourself to say. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4717.46s)]
*  I'm honest about it. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4720.179999999999s)]
*  But to me, I'm really proud of America because I think that [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4721.46s)]
*  I don't I think I can be the best version of myself here. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4725.06s)]
*  You know, I think that Donald Trump can only happen in America. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4727.860000000001s)]
*  Your life, what has happened to you? [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4731.7s)]
*  This is an American story. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4733.7s)]
*  My mom's life is an American story. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4736.1s)]
*  Like my mom's from Scotland. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4738.1s)]
*  She comes here and has all the success. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4739.14s)]
*  She's so grateful of what America is. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4740.74s)]
*  That doesn't mean that we can't make it better. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4742.5s)]
*  I like the idea of making it better every single time, [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4744.5s)]
*  fixing these things when there's leaks in the ship. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4747.54s)]
*  But the idea of America and becoming the greatest version of yourself [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4749.9400000000005s)]
*  is something I'll always be proud of. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4753.94s)]
*  I understand what you're saying. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4756.5s)]
*  When I was president, we had no wars in the whole world because of me. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4758.179999999999s)]
*  I stopped a lot of wars from happening. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4763.299999999999s)]
*  That makes me proud. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4764.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4766.259999999999s)]
*  But it's just not happening now. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4766.66s)]
*  Right now, people are dying in Ukraine because we had an incompetent president. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4768.099999999999s)]
*  If we had a president that knew what the hell he was doing, [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4772.82s)]
*  Ukraine would have never happened. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4775.78s)]
*  Israel would have never happened. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4777.62s)]
*  All those people that are dying on both sides, that would have never happened. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4779.139999999999s)]
*  Afghanistan, people falling off airplanes from 3,500 feet above the ground, [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4784.179999999999s)]
*  three times the height of the Empire State Building, off the side of the airplane. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4792.259999999999s)]
*  All of this horrible stuff would have never happened. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4796.98s)]
*  Inflation would have never happened because that was caused by energy and the stupid energy. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4799.78s)]
*  So, look, we love our country and it's had moments of greatness, [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4804.259999999999s)]
*  but I think it's a very, it's a declining, it's so sad what's happened. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4810.1s)]
*  We're a nation in decline and we can't let it be declined. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4816.58s)]
*  I'll give you an example. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4820.74s)]
*  We're going to lose our monetary base very soon because, you know, [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4821.7s)]
*  countries are going off the dollar. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4824.9s)]
*  I'm going to get them back on the dollar. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4827.54s)]
*  I'm going to say, you got to go back on though. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4829.14s)]
*  You're not going to do any business with, you know, you got to do it. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4830.74s)]
*  But I do think this, where I really agree with you, [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4834.82s)]
*  we have tremendous potential and I say it, make America great again. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4838.02s)]
*  And I just want to, I would like to have it. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4844.42s)]
*  I used to have something, I was going to use it and I didn't use it [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4847.06s)]
*  because the country started to do badly, CAG, not MAGA, CAG. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4849.46s)]
*  I never liked the word CAG, but it was keep America great. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4854.1s)]
*  You like that, Fred? [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4858.02s)]
*  I like this. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4858.580000000001s)]
*  But see, I couldn't use it because we had so many problems. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4859.540000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it sounds like that other word. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4864.18s)]
*  It doesn't work as well. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4866.1s)]
*  There's never going to be another MAGA. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4868.42s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4870.34s)]
*  I came up with a phrase that just turned out to be a MAGA. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4870.900000000001s)]
*  No, it's the greatest movement, political movement in the history of our country. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4873.780000000001s)]
*  And these are people that really love our country and they want it to be great. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4878.26s)]
*  And we're going to make it great again. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4881.620000000001s)]
*  That was what I would like to do is make this country so great, [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4883.3s)]
*  better than what you're even thinking. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4888.9800000000005s)]
*  And you are. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4890.580000000001s)]
*  I mean, I love your attitude because I think that's the way you should be. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4891.14s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4895.14s)]
*  There is one thing I want to give you a rumor I'd like to give you a chance to dispel. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4895.54s)]
*  And one question, if you have time, I'd like to ask selfishly. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4898.74s)]
*  Rumor, the far left, I think, says this thing that, [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4901.06s)]
*  oh, if Donald Trump wins, he's never going to cede power. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4904.0199999999995s)]
*  Then they have some clip of you saying, [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4907.54s)]
*  just vote for me one time, you won't have to vote again. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4909.78s)]
*  I don't believe this is true. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4911.78s)]
*  I want to give you a chance to publicly say that's nonsense. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4912.82s)]
*  Just so you can publicly speak to any moderates out there. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4915.3s)]
*  So what I said, yeah, Christians tend to vote at a very low percentage for some reason. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4917.38s)]
*  And so do gun owners. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4923.7s)]
*  Would you believe it? [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4924.74s)]
*  The NRA gun owners tend not to vote. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4925.38s)]
*  Maybe it's a rebellious thing. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4927.86s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4929.139999999999s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4929.54s)]
*  I said, look, our country's in big trouble. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4930.66s)]
*  Really big trouble with the border, with all the problems. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4933.7s)]
*  We can solve the problem. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4936.26s)]
*  But vote this one time. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4937.78s)]
*  After that, we're not going to need it. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4939.78s)]
*  This is the most important election in the history of our country. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4942.9s)]
*  Vote for this most important election. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4946.42s)]
*  And then if you don't want to vote, we're going to have elections, [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4948.74s)]
*  but you don't have to vote because it's going to go along swimmingly. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4950.98s)]
*  That's how I interpreted it. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4953.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4954.9s)]
*  That's how everybody interprets it. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4955.38s)]
*  That's how they interpret it too. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4957.22s)]
*  Yes. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4958.9s)]
*  They know what you're saying. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4959.3s)]
*  You got to vote this time because we don't have, we can't wait four years. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4960.0199999999995s)]
*  Because you know what? [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4964.179999999999s)]
*  In another four years, like we've just had with this clown that's a president, [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4964.9s)]
*  that's just a clown, a foolish man. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4968.42s)]
*  Don't forget, he was a stupid man 25 years ago. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4970.82s)]
*  He was never a smart man. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4973.86s)]
*  He's run many times. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4975.54s)]
*  Isn't it amazing? [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4977.86s)]
*  He's run many times and he gets it when he's in serious decline. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4978.9s)]
*  But anyway, so everybody knows that. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4983.62s)]
*  And that's what I meant by it. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4986.9s)]
*  It means we got to fix it. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4989.459999999999s)]
*  And then it's going to work beautifully. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4991.459999999999s)]
*  It's going to run beautiful. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4993.54s)]
*  We're going to have elections every two years and every four years. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4994.5s)]
*  It's going to be good. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4996.9s)]
*  I just want to give you a chance to say that. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4997.54s)]
*  And if I could ask one question. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=4998.66s)]
*  Everybody I speak to, every race, creed, whatever, they don't just like you, they love you. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5001.299999999999s)]
*  And I talk to people on both sides about your policies. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5005.86s)]
*  And a lot of people like your policies. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5008.339999999999s)]
*  The China tariff that's still in place right now is an example of policy that people love. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5010.9s)]
*  I think sometimes what we love about you as comedians is you shoot from the hip. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5015.219999999999s)]
*  But then that gets twisted into this rhetoric that adds gasoline onto everything. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5019.3s)]
*  So the one thing I would like as I think a moderate person is maybe if you get elected, [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5024.58s)]
*  would you be a little bit more mindful of how powerful your words are for better and for worse? [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5028.98s)]
*  I will. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5032.66s)]
*  And I'm going to think of you every time. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5033.139999999999s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5036.5s)]
*  I might actually vote. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5037.46s)]
*  I don't think I'm going to think of you. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5038.98s)]
*  No, no, it's true. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5040.18s)]
*  I mean, I understand that. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5041.14s)]
*  Sometimes they say, well, could you be a little bit more, [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5043.06s)]
*  but you're doing a lot of things and you're solving a lot of problems. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5045.22s)]
*  I stopped wars that nobody will ever know about. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5048.58s)]
*  They won't know about. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5051.78s)]
*  But countries that were fighting each other and didn't affect us much, [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5052.74s)]
*  but they did business with us. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5055.7s)]
*  I called up two countries that have fought themselves, fought for thousands of years, [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5057.62s)]
*  killing each other for years. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5061.94s)]
*  And I said, you guys are at it again. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5064.1s)]
*  I heard it was going to start up. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5066.9s)]
*  I stopped it when I first came in. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5068.5s)]
*  And I said, listen, here's the story. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5070.5s)]
*  If you go to war with each other, I can give you the details, [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5072.5s)]
*  but I don't even want to bother because it's nice now. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5075.3s)]
*  I said, you're not going to do any more business with the United States. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5078.66s)]
*  I'm going to cut you off 100%. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5082.66s)]
*  And if you do get through, I'm going to charge you 200% tariffs. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5084.98s)]
*  You won't be able to survive. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5087.86s)]
*  So work it out. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5090.02s)]
*  Work it out. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5091.86s)]
*  You know, it was a country that split and then they've been fighting for years, [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5092.82s)]
*  the two halves of the house. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5096.66s)]
*  I think like thousands. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5098.02s)]
*  I get a call and I forget about it, but I had a rough call with them. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5099.860000000001s)]
*  And I said, I'm going to charge you tariffs and I'm going to, [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5103.46s)]
*  you're not going to do, you're going to be cut off. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5106.1s)]
*  No more business. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5107.700000000001s)]
*  And if they don't have the United States, it's a problem. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5108.660000000001s)]
*  And we have to keep it that way. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5111.22s)]
*  We have to keep our country strong so we can do this. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5112.660000000001s)]
*  I mean, if our country is weak, we don't have that. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5115.14s)]
*  You know, if we keep getting weaker and weaker, which is happening, [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5117.22s)]
*  we're not going to let that happen. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5120.660000000001s)]
*  So I get a call two weeks later, two days later. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5121.780000000001s)]
*  Sir, we've worked it all out. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5126.18s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5128.58s)]
*  And I go about my business. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5129.46s)]
*  I save thousands of lives, hundreds of thousands of them. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5130.900000000001s)]
*  They've been killing each other for years, for centuries. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5134.18s)]
*  And I save thousands of lives and nobody writes about it. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5138.5s)]
*  Many people don't even know that's the reason, you know, things are good. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5143.780000000001s)]
*  And I had it out with them. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5148.18s)]
*  I said, you guys are crazy. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5149.22s)]
*  You do that. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5151.38s)]
*  No more doing business with the United States. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5152.26s)]
*  You cut off 100 percent. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5154.58s)]
*  You're dead. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5156.58s)]
*  You're not going to do 10 cents worth of business. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5157.38s)]
*  And I even said the tariff thing, but the first was actually even more powerful. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5160.66s)]
*  And that's it. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5165.54s)]
*  I forget about it. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5166.26s)]
*  I go about doing my business. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5167.22s)]
*  Two days later, I said, congratulations. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5168.58s)]
*  So what on what? [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5170.26s)]
*  So and so and so and so. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5171.62s)]
*  They're not going to have a word. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5172.9s)]
*  They made peace. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5173.78s)]
*  I've done so many things like that. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5175.0599999999995s)]
*  And none of them hit the news. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5177.3s)]
*  Most of them are. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5179.3s)]
*  None of them are known. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5180.0199999999995s)]
*  Most of them aren't really known. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5180.98s)]
*  You know, I've made I've made countries do things for us because they were treating us unfairly. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5182.82s)]
*  And I've gotten things for our country that nobody else I really think nobody else could have done. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5188.179999999999s)]
*  But I enjoy doing it for our country. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5192.82s)]
*  And, you know, just to get back to where you originally started, I want to make America great again. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5195.78s)]
*  I want to make it so great that people won't question it so that people can say what you just said. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5200.58s)]
*  No, no, it's great. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5206.82s)]
*  I don't want to have a question. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5207.94s)]
*  Why should I or anybody else say, no, it's not great anymore? [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5209.0599999999995s)]
*  I don't want to be in that position. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5213.139999999999s)]
*  I think I want to make it so that when you ask a question, we can say, well, it's a great, great country. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5214.58s)]
*  We love our country, but we can do a couple of little things. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5221.46s)]
*  I think we need that. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c&t=5223.86s)]
