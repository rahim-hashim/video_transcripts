*  You could bet on top sports and political events and use the promo code flagrant for your welcome bonus [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2105.16s)]
*  So just know that when you're betting on the World Series [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2110.08s)]
*  Obviously for the Yankees not for the ops not for the bad guys [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2112.64s)]
*  Okay, when you're betting for the Yankees, you know that the Yankees have no immigrants on our team [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2116.3199999999997s)]

*  All right, we're back I need to bring up something [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2233.56s)]
*  I think the best [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2236.84s)]
*  Documentarian alive right now is a guy named Chris Smith [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2239.6800000000003s)]
*  He has he's the guy who did the Vince McMahon doc that's out right now [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2243.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah fire Jim and Andy. He did Tiger King Tiger King. He did 100 foot wave [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2246.64s)]
*  I don't know if you guys saw that one was fucking incredible. I didn't see on 100 foot wave is like [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2253.3199999999997s)]
*  Tackle it [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2257.3999999999996s)]
*  So these guys are seeking to ride a hundred foot wave, right? [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2259.16s)]
*  And they're these big wave surfers. They get towed in you should probably see it and there's this wave in Portugal Nazare [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2261.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm probably mispronouncing it but [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2267.3199999999997s)]
*  Since what happens is because of the way like Nazare Bay is [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2269.7200000000003s)]
*  Created over millions of years these two swells come together [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2274.1600000000003s)]
*  They create these gigantic peaks and you can serve the biggest waves in the world there. Anyway [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2277.48s)]
*  This guy [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2282.44s)]
*  Okay, this is what's so impressive about like documentaries that are fantastic [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2284.44s)]
*  You have to create a story that you cannot control [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2289.96s)]
*  You can control to a certain extent but like you're using what people are telling you, right? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2293.6400000000003s)]
*  Right, right. You can't change their words and [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2297.96s)]
*  I'm watching this Vince McMahon doc [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2302.52s)]
*  And I went into it as someone who like I watched wrestling when I was young [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2305.5600000000004s)]
*  But I wasn't like the biggest wrestling fan like I got caught up a little bit with the Rock or whatever [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2308.96s)]
*  Like when I was younger, you know, maybe Hogan and what is it? The Ultimate Warrior or whatever? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2312.84s)]
*  Obviously always loved the Undertaker the Undertaker is just like iconic to me. It's almost like bigger than wrestling. Yeah, but [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2318.52s)]
*  I'm watching this documentary and I [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2323.92s)]
*  First of all one episode in it's the best documentary on TV right now. Please everybody go watch this fucking thing. It's absolutely amazing. I [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2326.32s)]
*  wish I watched wrestling [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2333.6800000000003s)]
*  Because it is such a beautiful [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2336.2400000000002s)]
*  Distillation of whatever is happening in American culture at the time [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2340.64s)]
*  Yeah, because it's a mirror on purpose [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2344.64s)]
*  They're reflecting the trends that are happening and then showcasing them in a little bit of a way [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2347.2000000000003s)]
*  And showcasing them in a little bit more cartoonish way, obviously through the wrestling [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2352.24s)]
*  I always looked I was like is this like an athletic thing? Is this um [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2357.04s)]
*  People believe it's real at least when I was younger, but then it's not or whatever [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2361.9199999999996s)]
*  It has nothing to do whether it's real or not. It's these storylines that they put together and literally turning it [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2366.3199999999997s)]
*  There's this saying everything is wrestling. I didn't even understand until I was watching this documentary [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2373.12s)]
*  Doing the most [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2378.8799999999997s)]
*  Uh, it sometimes is salacious sometimes it is the most [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2381.84s)]
*  seductive sometimes the most evil sometimes it's the most heroic thing at the time and [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2385.6s)]
*  Long-term thinking you have to set up a wrestlemania [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2392.0s)]
*  Months prior. Yeah and watching the way that they would reflect culture understand what the people wanted and knowing [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2395.44s)]
*  That if people are upset [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2402.7200000000003s)]
*  Vocally, it's just as good as if they're happy. Well, if they're cheering or booing [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2404.6400000000003s)]
*  It's the same [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2409.92s)]
*  soap operas for men [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2411.44s)]
*  Yeah, because you have to keep the story going you have to keep them engaged [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2412.88s)]
*  You have to have your peaks and your hoes and Vince is willing to do anything. He is willing to do anything [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2415.92s)]
*  There's a great there's a great line in it where he says somebody says about him [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2421.6000000000004s)]
*  They're like the only person that Vince has been [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2425.84s)]
*  Loyal to his entire life is the business. Yeah, he doesn't own the business the business owns him [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2429.2000000000003s)]
*  I [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2435.12s)]
*  Compel you all to go watch this documentary [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2440.0s)]
*  Yeah, give it one episode and tell me that you do not tee up that second one [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2442.24s)]
*  I know that you guys have seen I don't know if you've finished it yet. Yeah, you finished it you just first episode [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2446.16s)]
*  Yeah, okay. What are your takes so far? What are things you didn't know about wrestling? [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2450.96s)]
*  Like what I've been looking for a doc like this for like two years [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2454.88s)]
*  I was like googling like wrestling docs and watching like wrestling docs on youtube like that people put together [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2458.16s)]
*  I didn't realize that this was like in production [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2462.7999999999997s)]
*  And then the I love that it explains the history of wrestling in all the arcs like it's not just about Vince [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2464.7999999999997s)]
*  It's the entirety of wwf slash ww through the like viewpoint of the guy the creator of it [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2469.84s)]
*  Yeah, uh, I kind of goes back to the adage like great men are hardly ever good men [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2476.16s)]
*  Because he is simultaneously both he's like an absolute genius and like probably the greatest promoter of all time ever and also like [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2481.04s)]
*  A true addict to like his proclivities and like he becomes the character and he talks about that [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2488.24s)]
*  About other I don't want to give up too much [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2495.04s)]
*  But like there's a moment where he talks about how sometimes other wrestlers will start to believe that they are the character [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2496.56s)]
*  And not realizing that he became it and what I thought was so good about this guy who does the doc chris smith is that? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2503.7599999999998s)]
*  You know how in wrestle it's like the doc almost mirrors wrestling in wrestling [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2513.12s)]
*  There'll be these heels that sometimes will turn [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2518.72s)]
*  Baby face or face faces like good guy heel is bad guy [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2522.08s)]
*  He does that with the wrestlers in the doc [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2525.52s)]
*  You're rooting for Vince [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2529.2799999999997s)]
*  Then he's the heel you're rooting against him. Then he switches it makes you [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2531.84s)]
*  And like and i'm watching it [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2536.24s)]
*  Like assessing my emotional connection to the different characters [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2538.24s)]
*  and you get honest shit in this like [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2542.64s)]
*  Hulk Hogan admits to snitching on all the other wrestlers when they were trying to unionize against Vince [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2545.68s)]
*  And he goes, yeah, I went and told Vince they were all trying to unionize [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2551.12s)]
*  And then he later turns on Vince and sells him out goes to wcw and then comes back [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2554.48s)]
*  And Vince knows that's the best thing if he comes back [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2559.6s)]
*  That was actually an interesting point that Vince doesn't look betrayal in return [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2563.52s)]
*  As him like giving in he sees it as a power thing [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2567.52s)]
*  Yeah, that no matter what you say about me you always come back [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2571.12s)]
*  And that's so interesting because I never saw that was like the ultimate victory. Yeah, you came [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2574.32s)]
*  Crawling back, whatever it is. That's the ultimate sign of of power and dominance [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2578.64s)]
*  And he looks at just what's good for business. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter one of the chicks [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2583.36s)]
*  Suit them. They paid out and then they hired her back just because now she got ratings [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2588.64s)]
*  That is nuts. I mean the storylines with this family would hold it [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2594.8s)]
*  Unbelievable like the fact that he's like, okay, i'm gonna put my daughter in she's now a wrestler and like she's a part of the storylines and [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2597.84s)]
*  They're all calling her a slut [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2603.52s)]
*  Thousands of people in this arena and then he looks over and just goes [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2605.84s)]
*  Right. There's a guy perfect. Sorry go alcohol [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2609.44s)]
*  piggybacking off that like [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2613.28s)]
*  I thought he was already off [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2615.36s)]
*  like you see it happening throughout the doc, but when one of the storylines was [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2617.36s)]
*  He was going to say that he slept with his daughter [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2622.6400000000003s)]
*  He impregnated her impregnated daughter for a storyline. I'm like yo this guy's next level. Yeah, he's great [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2625.2s)]
*  I loved it because I was a bit more of a wrestling guy [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2632.56s)]
*  Like I probably had like maybe a five to ten year period where I was like in it [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2635.9199999999996s)]
*  I had like a two year run when I was like really in it and then when you said male soap opera [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2639.52s)]
*  I remember I missed like two episodes and then I didn't care anymore and I was like, oh, it's a male soap opera [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2643.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, i'm good [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2648.48s)]
*  But the way they tell and my brother when he broke down the cody roads getting the belt from roman reign [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2649.7599999999998s)]
*  It was like a multi-year arc and then it paid off in a way that everybody was so fucking thrilled about it's like wow [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2655.12s)]
*  That is I mean perfect storytelling. It's perfect. I'm like having undertaker undefeated for every wrestlemania [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2661.92s)]
*  And then the first time he lost that was like traumatic [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2668.2400000000002s)]
*  That was like I can't believe what's happening right now. Oh, you remember going through that [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2672.08s)]
*  Like that was nuts. I'm like, no this can't happen like I was [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2675.92s)]
*  Flustered i'm like that shit works. They're good. He's good [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2680.2200000000003s)]
*  He understands how to evoke that motion emotion and reflect what the people are feeling like when he becomes [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2683.52s)]
*  The big bad billionaire owner [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2689.84s)]
*  It's at a time when american workers were really starting to resent these successful people who are holding them down [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2691.92s)]
*  And they didn't feel the confidence in the american dream that they might have felt a decade prior [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2699.6000000000004s)]
*  A decade prior they might have felt maybe I could be fucking hulk hogan [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2704.32s)]
*  I can go out there rip my shirt off like I wonder if there's some of this reflects american economy and opportunity [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2707.84s)]
*  but like to be able to [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2713.36s)]
*  Understand that and go oh [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2715.1200000000003s)]
*  They hate me because i'm the boss that makes these horrible decisions [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2717.52s)]
*  And I don't care about the working man or the people that love stone cold [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2720.8s)]
*  I didn't realize the rejection of the authority. Yeah, I didn't realize this like growing up [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2724.0s)]
*  Everyone had awesome 316 like bumper stickers and shirts. You just see it everywhere like where I grew up in florida [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2728.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and now that i'm understanding what he represented. Yeah, I get it so much more if i'm not mistaken [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2732.6400000000003s)]
*  It was around the period where it was like the one percent ninety nine percent. They were doing all those uh, those uh, [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2737.52s)]
*  March protests or whatever protests. Yeah, so it's like he like you said [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2742.8s)]
*  This is going on in reality and he just amplifies it and he didn't mind being the absolute boogie man [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2746.48s)]
*  He's like i'll take it. He I will take the heat. You can hate me all you fucking want [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2751.6s)]
*  And most people can't check that ego someone even said this to us about uh fighters entering the ring [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2755.6800000000003s)]
*  Like it's very hard for a fighter to be a heel something i've always credited jake about [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2760.96s)]
*  Jake chael might have said this jails probably he's like these fighters come to the ring and we want to be cheered [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2765.2000000000003s)]
*  It's hard to be booed [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2770.3199999999997s)]
*  But if you are booed like crazy you can make crazy money [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2772.0s)]
*  But it is emotionally too much weight for the fighter to hold [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2776.72s)]
*  I think that's something that you got to give jake credit for like he can be hated [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2780.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's a superpower. Yeah, that was an interesting moment seeing how the rock turned his entry into [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2784.24s)]
*  Like praise like by ultimately addressing and sort of confronting the ridicule and the booze [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2790.4s)]
*  Like it's just a good lesson like yeah, they're getting he's getting shoved down the throat to the fans [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2796.4s)]
*  They hate it [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2800.7200000000003s)]
*  They hate that he's some legacy guy that everything was given to him because it looks like nepotism exactly it's handed to him [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2801.36s)]
*  And then he acknowledges it and calls like a respect thing and then kind of turns heel shut your candy ass up [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2806.08s)]
*  And they like it they love and they and they love it. It's like just such a good lesson [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2811.84s)]
*  Like oh if you're in that position [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2815.76s)]
*  Like there's you can look at wrestling as kind of a template for like how to deal with the criticism [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2817.84s)]
*  You can look at wrestling for a template for entertainment in general [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2822.0s)]
*  And some people just end up doing it authentically like it just it is so pure to them. I think uh [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2825.8399999999997s)]
*  like the the fighting version of [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2831.12s)]
*  Stone cold this is going to seem a little bit derivative but like a nate dies [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2835.2s)]
*  I do whatever I want. I'm gonna you know, i'm gonna also nate and shawb are beefing right now [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2840.7999999999997s)]
*  Which is wild to see if that turns out. Yeah, but like [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2845.6s)]
*  But I mean imagine they actually fight [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2848.96s)]
*  Shawb is a big boy fire. Yeah, that's yeah [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2851.52s)]
*  But this idea that like nate has always been beloved because he's always been rebellious [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2854.3199999999997s)]
*  I do what I want. I'll smoke fucking weed. Fuck you. I'm going out there. I'm choking you out [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2860.08s)]
*  I don't give a fuck. Yeah, and he hasn't presented to us as some [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2864.56s)]
*  Multi-billionaire who's made all this money fighting and now we resent his life and his success. Yeah [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2869.74s)]
*  anyway, I [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2875.9199999999996s)]
*  I would go watch this [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2877.52s)]
*  There's there's one question. Sorry, does he become the character or was he always a character? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2879.52s)]
*  And we're being a little sympathetic saying he's so I think he becomes I thought about this. I think what happens is [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2884.3999999999996s)]
*  I think what happens is like the character is always like a part of you [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2893.6s)]
*  And it might be like a quiet part of your personality that you can tap into right and then the positive [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2898.3199999999997s)]
*  Reinforcement gives you more confidence in leaning into that part of you that I think even just that question is more profound than you know [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2905.58s)]
*  Because he modeled the character after his father [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2913.2s)]
*  So [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2917.6s)]
*  Was it an inevitability that he would just always end up like his father? [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2918.56s)]
*  And him creating that character was that just a faster pipeline to becoming that or is that ultimately why he did it because he became [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2923.2799999999997s)]
*  The character that he modeled after his dad also like crazy a lot of eerie [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2929.04s)]
*  Similarities with trump like he has a son that's always just wanted love from him that he never gave love [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2933.82s)]
*  Yeah, like just a lot of similar thing getting yes dad just he's just getting the shit beaten out of him every day [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2939.7599999999998s)]
*  But I step dad and his dad never acknowledged. Yeah, just kind of pats him on the back when he meets him [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2946.16s)]
*  Everybody I mean there's I mean, yeah, there's some awesome moments. We're like his yeah, you gotta watch it. It is [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2950.56s)]
*  And wrestling fans are listening this being like duh [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2957.44s)]
*  We understand that we're late and I want to talk to some wrestlers actually about this [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2960.48s)]
*  Like there's a guy on it cody roads that you see in it and you had spoken you've done this like great breakdown [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2964.72s)]
*  Like what his arc had been? Yeah, but [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2970.8799999999997s)]
*  He's really fascinating because his father was also a wrestler, but he seems to have this um [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2974.3199999999997s)]
*  It's almost like a bird's eye view of it all like he's almost kind of fluent in wrestling because he grew up in it [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2981.8399999999997s)]
*  Just like vince did like this his dad was a promoter. I had no fucking clue. He took over the business [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2986.7999999999997s)]
*  He bought it. He bought his dad out. Oh wow [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2990.72s)]
*  so [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2993.6800000000003s)]
*  Knowing that kind of like what oh, this is how it works [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2995.04s)]
*  This is the business. How do you succeed within the business? [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=2998.32s)]
*  Like I want to know what the fuck cody did politically to sell vince on him winning [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3001.6s)]
*  That's also like you got to know on the come up. What do I need to do in order to get that belt? [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3007.84s)]
*  I need the fans to either not want me to have it at all [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3013.04s)]
*  Or be really rooting for me because vince's decision ain't about oh, I like him [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3017.28s)]
*  He's sweet. He's talented. It's what does that fucking audience want? Yeah, well, what would they hate the most? Yeah [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3022.16s)]
*  Done hooking he hooked his daughter out with triple h that was just supposed to be a storyline and that became [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3029.7599999999998s)]
*  Real life like kind of forced the marriage because they needed a marriage storyline for the show [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3036.08s)]
*  Wow, it's crazy [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3042.64s)]
*  It's really crazy and a great thing about this doc is that they started it before the shit came out about vince [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3044.48s)]
*  And then the last two episodes it's after the show that came out about vince [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3051.6s)]
*  And so it's like wow you see all the stuff that people were saying like no he's [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3056.56s)]
*  Like everybody except vince was saying no, that's kind of him [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3060.56s)]
*  Like he vince is in denial and then you hear all the stuff that happens like oh shit. That really was also credit the wrestlers on it [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3064.6400000000003s)]
*  They are [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3070.8s)]
*  Brutally honest. Yeah, and so good. I mean you get why they're the greatest you see why vince was like [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3072.32s)]
*  Yeah, you're gonna run the ring. Every one of them is cutting a promo promo while they're talking [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3077.92s)]
*  It's not like some awkward nervous person in a documentary like oh my god. What will the world say what I have to they are soaking it up [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3082.32s)]

*  He's so such a run, you know, it's funny is it uh [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3103.92s)]
*  My folks had a small business right they taught dance lessons [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3107.44s)]
*  But I think that that frames your view of the world a little bit where it's like I [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3111.44s)]
*  I didn't care for stone cold rebelling against the business owner [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3116.88s)]
*  You know what? So I was like, oh, I guess he's like a texas guy drinking the beers and do like but it wasn't [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3121.04s)]

*  This is like the my brother watched like a wrestlemania on tape and it was one [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3130.72s)]
*  I think they decided to turn stone cold face [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3133.68s)]
*  Return stone cold face. Yeah, and so I the thing that got it was like a submission match and that guy breathed [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3135.68s)]
*  The hitman hard who would like never lost submission match, whatever so stone cold is like bleeding [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3140.7999999999997s)]
*  He must cut his head open. He's bleeding refuses to quit quit refuses to quit and that's when people are like [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3144.48s)]

*  Yeah, now I love all the other stuff because I get that guy at his heart [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3162.08s)]
*  It's like a save the cat moment where like at that guy at his heart [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3165.52s)]
*  Is a he's a guy who will never quit he will never give in [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3169.12s)]

*  uh, just [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3176.0s)]
*  there's there's these moments where [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3177.28s)]
*  He has this line. He talks about uh [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3179.36s)]
*  He goes he talks about the belt. He goes they don't the belt isn't theirs meaning the champions. Yes, it's my belt [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3181.76s)]
*  And sometimes the champions don't want to give up the belt so he needs to devise situations where unbeknownst to them [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3189.12s)]
*  They lose that fucking belt because it's not theirs. Yeah, but he can't just strip them because then the audience will be furious [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3196.7200000000003s)]
*  You know [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3203.52s)]
*  You gotta gotta watch this thing. I also love seeing vince's failures [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3204.88s)]
*  I think that's like really helpful xfl like see like this restaurant and times square like all these different ventures that he does [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3208.88s)]
*  That don't work and he's like, yeah, it's fine. Just wake up the next day [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3214.8s)]
*  I'm moving on to the next thing by the time this thing is going [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3218.1600000000003s)]

*  Like he's just so locked in on the process and loves the process. He does not dwell on any failure [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3222.48s)]
*  I mean there's a whole episode where wcw comes out and this guy eric bischoff is the guy who runs it and [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3226.8s)]
*  It starts to dominate. Yeah, I remember that and 83 weeks [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3232.88s)]
*  Yeah, 83 weeks. Yeah, and it's like [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3236.48s)]
*  They talk about what's going on and you start to really sympathize and empathize for vince [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3239.36s)]
*  Like what the fuck is going on and the adjustments that wcw made to be successful the adjustments that um, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3243.92s)]
*  wwe made like [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3251.74s)]

*  Uh, yeah, but anyway masterful storytelling and the most brutally honest like these wrestlers [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3271.28s)]
*  I think outside of the undertaker it almost felt like none of them [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3278.7200000000003s)]
*  were uh [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3283.1200000000003s)]
*  You know, sometimes people like won't speak because they feel guilty talking about a friend or something like that. Yeah [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3285.6000000000004s)]
*  Did you get that sense from anybody on the fucking triple ages his son-in-law and he's like he's like being honest [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3292.96s)]

*  I know dude. I keep again. I keep seeing like people say if you look at the electoral map [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3390.48s)]
*  She's not she's gonna win trump's not gonna win [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3394.0s)]
*  He she's gonna run away with it. I think uh fa or caseta sent us a link and it all kind of [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3396.72s)]
*  Yeah, fa sent us a link of a guy saying like he broke it down. Yeah [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3401.52s)]
*  But it seems like the energy is completely with trump cuban hit me up and he's like young dudes don't get out there and vote [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3405.68s)]
*  She's gonna win easily [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3411.8399999999997s)]
*  But then you see the energy [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3413.6s)]
*  Online and you're like, whoa [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3416.08s)]
*  There's been a resurgence [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3419.12s)]
*  And he's had some good moments this week like the mcdonald's shit was yeah, that shit was great. I mean great [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3421.12s)]
*  I I was initially was that great? [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3427.12s)]
*  Just the visual of a president [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3429.7599999999998s)]
*  Serving fries and mcdonald's and also like anything he does he reacts purely to you know how like [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3432.56s)]
*  Like one of the great things about stand-up is like you can give you can act hopefully you do it authentically and if you can't [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3439.52s)]
*  You can try your best to recreate that authenticity with how you would react in the moment to these stories that you're telling or these things [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3446.7999999999997s)]
*  Right. Yeah, very few people react in the moment to stuff how they feel because there's a concern or the cost of it [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3453.12s)]
*  And I think the the reason why trump is so entertaining is because he is genuinely reacting in the moment to how he feels [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3460.64s)]
*  Every single time he approaches stimulus. Yeah, so when he did that roast thing if the joke was bad [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3468.16s)]
*  He's like that was a nasty joke like that [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3474.24s)]
*  He's not going oh if it bombs i'm gonna say this. Yeah, he is reacting in the moment [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3477.36s)]
*  He's in the middle of a setup someone interrupts him and he addresses it and he's like, oh, yeah. Yeah, anyway back to the joke [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3481.52s)]
*  Like he's like completely aware of everything that's happening at all times [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3487.36s)]
*  Yeah [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3490.08s)]
*  and and yeah [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3490.56s)]
*  So it's like you can't not watch and then when you see somebody who's trying to like [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3491.36s)]
*  Orchestrate the perfect version of an interview it comes across a little bit authentic or just boring. Yeah [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3495.52s)]
*  Okay now that can be horrible because you can say horrible things [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3502.08s)]
*  Because some of us have horrible reactions to shit. This podcast is an example of it [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3506.32s)]
*  We constantly react in the moment to things and then go. Whoa, that was a little wild [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3511.36s)]
*  And he's also reacted to things in the moment a little wild. Yeah. Yeah. Haiti's a shit whole country [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3515.44s)]
*  Like all right. Well, that's that's a little crazy to say. I mean, it's a very authentic reaction [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3519.44s)]
*  You nailed it but it is a little crazy [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3522.88s)]
*  It's authentic [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3527.2000000000003s)]
*  It's not right, but you can feel it's how he felt [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3528.96s)]
*  So why is this good? Watch to me? This is like stage bullshit, but watching him in the environment [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3532.0s)]
*  So I didn't like that. They shut down the first of all, this is crazy. This is where my wife grew up [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3538.32s)]
*  I've been to that like the shopping center where this mcdonald's is feasterville. Yeah, it's like five minutes from her dad's house hilarious, but uh, [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3542.5600000000004s)]
*  They shut it down which I was initially critical of but then fa brought up a good point which is as many assassination attempts of their as [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3549.6s)]
*  There have been you can't have you can't have just a fucking open drive-through and anybody [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3554.96s)]
*  In philly made complete sense. Yeah [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3559.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, there's no way. Okay [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3562.4s)]
*  They shut down whole golf courses for any president to golf ever like you'll lose your bro [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3565.36s)]
*  We were doing shows in cincinnati this weekend and jd vance was in town [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3571.2799999999997s)]
*  Because he lives over there and they shut down the whole highway for jd vance [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3575.2799999999997s)]
*  We're not even talking about the guy who they're actually trying to kill. Yeah, so shutting down the mcdonald's is not that crazy idea [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3580.0s)]
*  Okay, let's just see the the react [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3585.2799999999997s)]
*  They ask him what his favorite thing on the menu is. Yeah, what's your favorite thing to order on mcdonald's? [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3588.0s)]
*  I like it all [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3593.12s)]
*  I like every ounce of it everything but I do like the french fries who i'll be working [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3595.84s)]
*  Look at them [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3602.08s)]
*  Is it just a cartoon character everything he does is funny [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3606.0s)]
*  Look at this [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3618.0s)]
*  Perfect looking person that is great [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3627.04s)]
*  Great [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3629.3s)]
*  Yeah, no compliments for the mom [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3634.6600000000003s)]
*  None [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3637.78s)]
*  I think he's tired. I think he's kind of tired and just doesn't give a shit anymore. Yo, that's kind of that's kind of my feeling [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3639.3s)]
*  And it's more attractive and it's gonna work way better for not giving a shit about the most important job in the world [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3645.0600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I think he's kind of tired. I think he's he's old and it's been a lot and it's been a long time [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3651.7000000000003s)]
*  He's been fighting his ego is so tied up into it that he feels like he has to keep going [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3655.86s)]
*  But there's a little part of him that's like I just want to golf with my granddaughter [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3659.3s)]
*  I don't feel like fighting every single day [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3662.5s)]
*  I don't see like answering the same stupid questions every single day [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3664.5800000000004s)]
*  But if he doesn't win then he might face legal troubles in the last, you know, 10 15 years of his life [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3667.5400000000004s)]
*  And that's gonna suck now you're talking but i'm saying that would be shitty for him. So he's like, okay [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3672.26s)]
*  I've win I can kind of ameliorate some of those problems I lose [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3676.82s)]
*  And my ego takes a hit but I can just go golf. I also think he does want to win [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3680.02s)]
*  Like yeah, because he's a winner. He has a winner mentality, but I think that he's [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3683.7799999999997s)]
*  I think he's just bored [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3687.94s)]
*  Of the process. Yeah, so he's at the point where he said he's done so many interviews and they ask him the same thing every [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3690.2599999999998s)]
*  single time and it's so predictable that he's just like [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3695.38s)]
*  Can we have some fun? Can I just serve some fries at a mcdonald's? That makes sense. Yeah, can we [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3700.02s)]
*  Can we just listen to some music on stage bring some other people on stage? [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3704.9s)]
*  Let's like have them talk and we'll chop it up about them the al smith dinner [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3707.8599999999997s)]
*  He's like palling it up with chuck schumer who's supposed to be his mortal enemy [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3711.22s)]
*  He's not literally like I think they've been friends for decades, but chuck is like the leader of the democratic party, right? [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3715.4599999999996s)]
*  And he's palling up. He's I lay he's a good guy. I shouldn't say hey, I gave him his first check [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3721.14s)]
*  He's a good guy. I should never say this but I like this guy [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3725.62s)]
*  if [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3730.3399999999997s)]
*  I would say that he had a few glasses of wine [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3731.7799999999997s)]
*  If I didn't know that he doesn't drink [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3734.5s)]
*  It was that kind of looseness about being president is just rare [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3736.58s)]
*  You know, okay [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3741.8599999999997s)]
*  So this is he did it. I could see it. He did it because comal said that she worked at mcdonald's and he just flat out [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3743.22s)]
*  Was like I don't believe you. He's like i'm gonna work at mcdonald's longer than you say you did. Yeah [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3748.8199999999997s)]
*  You actually have worked at mcdonald's now versus now. I have worked at mcdonald's. I've now worked for 15 minutes more than [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3753.4599999999996s)]
*  So [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3760.3399999999997s)]
*  Why would she lie about something like that look they put on your resume I worked at mcdonald's why would she lie about that? [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3763.22s)]
*  Why did because she's lying [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3770.58s)]
*  That's alleged [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3774.98s)]
*  That's alleged. Anyway, he's got some others you want to watch some of the else we got kamala was [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3776.42s)]
*  Skipping the al smith dinner. I'd really hope that she would come because we [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3781.78s)]
*  Can't get enough of hearing her beautiful laugh. She laughs like crazy [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3786.02s)]
*  We would recognize it any place in this room and all polls are indicating i'm leading big with the catholic vote [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3790.5s)]
*  as I should be [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3798.02s)]
*  As I should be [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3799.86s)]
*  But I don't think kamala has given up yet. She hasn't instead of attending tonight [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3802.1000000000004s)]
*  She's in michigan receiving communion from gretchen whitmer. Why is that funny? I don't get that [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3807.0600000000004s)]
*  I don't really get it. I thought I thought it was gonna be like her laugh is she sounds like a fucking [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3813.5400000000004s)]

*  very glum [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3841.38s)]
*  But look on the bright side chuck considering how woke [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3848.5s)]
*  Your party has become [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3852.18s)]
*  If kamala loses you still have a chance to become the first woman president [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3854.1s)]
*  Just called you a bitch right to your face is crazy [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3862.02s)]
*  That is bro, I love that they do this i'm actually bummed kamala didn't do it. Yeah [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3866.18s)]

*  It's just such a great tradition. Obviously we're biased because we're comedians [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3875.46s)]
*  But to see the most powerful people in your country get humbled [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3878.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, publicly. Yeah, it's a pretty awesome tradition. Yeah [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3883.06s)]
*  But i'm you know, they're running and I think she wants to use every minute to try to be like [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3887.86s)]
*  Foot on the ground talking with the people. Yeah, I I I get the decision [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3893.22s)]
*  But also this has been historic like people have gone and done this the the the people running for president have gone done this [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3897.22s)]
*  Don't I feel like this gets seen by so many people if you do a good job. Yeah [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3903.06s)]
*  Obama I remember having some bangers in his and it's like yeah, this gets seen by millions and millions of people [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3908.02s)]
*  Yeah, but I guess they're being really targeted. I agree with you [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3913.54s)]
*  I would go for what everybody's gonna end up seeing but I think their strategy is we need [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3916.02s)]
*  5,000 people in this district of wisconsin to come out and if I go to that [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3921.68s)]
*  Target and speak at that target then maybe they will also allegedly she was pissed that her campaign manager said not to go [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3926.66s)]
*  Yeah, oh really? This is like behind the scenes. I don't know if any of this is true [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3933.94s)]
*  This is just like insider leaks or whatever that her campaign manager was like, yeah, don't go to that instead [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3937.46s)]
*  Go to this other thing because it'll be more beneficial yada yada [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3942.18s)]
*  And she like freaked out flipped out on the campaign manager was like if I lose this election [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3944.34s)]
*  It's your fucking fault and like went off. It's like that. That's fire [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3948.18s)]
*  Apparently that's what happened. But I think this might be the funniest Trump thing is when you talk about Arnold Palmer [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3952.82s)]
*  Yeah, this is great. Awesome. This is at a rally. It's just talking about vote for trump [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3957.7s)]

*  This man was strong and tough [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3976.98s)]
*  and I refused to say it but when [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3980.1800000000003s)]
*  He took showers with the other pros. They came out of there. They said oh my god [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=3983.1400000000003s)]

*  like because he'll [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4418.74s)]
*  He'll push [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4420.1s)]
*  Yeah, like he pushes that fox news interview the fox thing, but I think she did really well on that [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4421.46s)]
*  Yeah, yeah with brett brett bear. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4427.38s)]
*  Yeah [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4430.42s)]
*  She was forced to show herself like be herself it wasn't just queued up prepared answers it was like oh shit [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4433.3s)]
*  I'm on defense. So I have to fight back and that's when her authentic self came out or what I think is [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4439.7s)]
*  Yeah, I just feel like [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4446.26s)]
*  And I say this [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4448.9800000000005s)]
*  with this is pure uh feelings no facts [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4450.5s)]
*  But I just feel like the republican party is a star based party and the democrat party is an institution based party [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4454.099999999999s)]
*  meaning [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4462.26s)]
*  Trump had so much star power that he took over the party and the party just fell in line [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4463.7s)]
*  They're like, okay, we're gonna go along with whatever starts like you are our leader. You're our [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4468.0199999999995s)]
*  Dictator you're whatever it is. We're following you and I think the democrats are like [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4473.04s)]
*  The party is the star and we will place different people in to be the figurehead for the party [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4478.9s)]
*  But the party is the star and if you're like fucking bernie you try to go a little bit outside of the party and do your [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4485.139999999999s)]
*  Own thing we'll remind you very quickly that the party is the star [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4490.339999999999s)]
*  I guess yeah, but obama had star quality. He had star power, but he still operated within the party [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4493.7s)]
*  And he's still to this day operating within the party. He's doing what he does [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4499.219999999999s)]
*  He's not stepping out republicans would hey we'll fall in line with trump [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4503.14s)]
*  He's not gonna say what republicans want a lot of time [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4506.9800000000005s)]
*  Remember how much they hated him when he first ran in 2016 in the primary? [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4509.9400000000005s)]
*  None of them liked him. They didn't really want to win this time and as soon as he wins [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4513.3s)]
*  Whatever he says, let's go but obamacare was like ultra progressive at the time and they all fell in line because it was actually [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4517.22s)]
*  Democrats, yeah, it was causing democrats to lose a lot of elections because they passed obamacare [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4524.18s)]
*  So that was him like pushing the envelope and then they all fell in line fair fair [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4530.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm not saying obama's not a star because he is a fucking superstar [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4533.54s)]
*  They just got lucky that they got a superstar that was willing to be part of the party [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4536.26s)]
*  And I think that that is like the culture of the democratic party like aoc was blabbering non-stop [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4540.82s)]
*  The party said hey, can you just tone it down a little bit? [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4546.98s)]
*  You don't hear every once in a while [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4549.38s)]
*  Maybe some gaza thing that she talks about but this girl was like every day hammering the fucking tweets [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4551.14s)]
*  Engaging with everybody and she is silence [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4557.700000000001s)]
*  My assumption is they told her how things work and they might have promised her something and they got the lever in place [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4560.5s)]
*  In the primary if they don't want you to win the super delegates is all that really matters [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4565.46s)]
*  And that's how you keep everyone in line [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4568.5s)]
*  Yeah, if if you're running as a democrat and you know, you cannot go against the machine. Yeah you [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4569.700000000001s)]
*  At a very early stage of your political career. You start realizing. Okay. Well, I need to work with the machine [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4576.26s)]
*  now [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4582.02s)]
*  in 2016 trump was [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4583.62s)]
*  Anti-machine i'm not taking your money. I'm gonna fund my own shit. So he was able to just fuck the machine [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4585.86s)]
*  Yeah, now there's no super delegates in that primary. So if he wins the primary he wins [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4591.22s)]
*  Bernie should have probably won in 2016, but they just had it like now this hillary's the horse they were picking [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4595.94s)]
*  That's what it is. All the super delegates are there. Good luck and he's admitted. So yeah. Yeah, so it's like [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4600.74s)]
*  He said it on theos podcast. Yeah crazy low key. I feel like aoc is just like [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4607.14s)]
*  Waiting by the side like she's gonna go for presidency one day that and I [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4611.700000000001s)]
*  Nothing makes me more confident that she will do that. Then the fact is she barely tweets anymore [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4617.860000000001s)]
*  She's she's going hey [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4624.9800000000005s)]
*  I actually want to take this serious and I think I can actually do it and i'm going to prove to you guys [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4626.5s)]
*  That I can kind of play ball. She'll be good into base and shit, too [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4631.22s)]
*  She'll like she'll have her moments. I don't i'm not the biggest fan, but she'll be good [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4634.34s)]
*  She'll be good as a candidate [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4638.18s)]
*  But it's just interesting to see how politics really works and we know we're just scratching the surface [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4639.54s)]
*  We don't really know the inner workings, right but to see [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4644.82s)]
*  Like how a party if you become part of the party how you need to operate within that party [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4648.5s)]
*  You can be a complete outsider if you're enough of a superstar and republican party and they will get behind whatever the fuck you say [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4653.3s)]
*  Like yeah, it's kind of wild trump lost that election and republicans won't even admit that [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4661.46s)]
*  Yeah, right fucking no, and the second nut he no longer has power of the republican party [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4668.099999999999s)]
*  If whoever has power says trump lost the election all those people would say guys he lost the election [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4676.42s)]
*  Like can we just move forward? [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4682.26s)]
*  But they want a [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4684.18s)]
*  As weird as it is in a democracy. It's almost like the party [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4686.18s)]
*  wants a dictator [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4690.099999999999s)]
*  Because directly after january 6 a lot of republicans were denouncing trump [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4692.5s)]
*  Yeah, because they even got a lot. Yeah, they thought it was like over for him [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4698.26s)]
*  And so they started turning on him and then it was like, oh shit. He still has following [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4701.54s)]
*  Let me switch that up real quick. I wonder if it's like just the nature of conservative [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4705.46s)]
*  Conservatism versus progressivism talk to me like if you were a progressive and you exist within a progressive [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4709.12s)]
*  Like party your job is to then outlie policy and so you have to push policy forward [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4715.3s)]
*  Whereas if you're a conservative, you can just be like, let's just keep this shit the same [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4720.099999999999s)]
*  so as a result it sort of like up up lifts like sort of [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4722.74s)]
*  Like demagogues like people that have like this cult of personality [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4727.7s)]
*  Whereas the policy people have to be more policy focused and so it necessitates less of a personality driven party [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4730.58s)]
*  Interesting. I don't know. But like that's just I wonder if that's the [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4736.4s)]
*  I wonder if that like contributes to it [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4740.18s)]
*  But I don't know if that exists like around I mean it kind of does like I feel like in argentina [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4741.94s)]
*  Like the right-wing faction is like much more personality driven and then the liberal faction is like much more policy driven [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4745.62s)]
*  Right-wing fashion in argentina right now is malay. Yeah [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4750.74s)]
*  And like he's like again, there's obviously policy not to say it's not policy [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4755.14s)]
*  But the policy is generally like hey, let's just kind of keep shit more or less how it is [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4757.86s)]
*  Yeah, well, it seems like he's switching it up malay. Well trying to go back to the way things were I guess make argentina great again [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4762.5s)]
*  Yeah, but I don't know. This is just my yeah, I like that [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4768.9s)]
*  Yeah, there's something interesting [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4772.5s)]
*  with that [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4774.74s)]
*  But yeah, I think it's definitely true though. I think conservatives like [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4776.1s)]
*  A strong figurehead which is why like you see a lot of them being like yo, putin is fucking awesome [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4779.54s)]
*  And you're like wait what? [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4784.98s)]
*  And you're like, yeah, he's just a beast. He's manly like it's less policy. They don't know what any of his policy is [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4786.58s)]
*  They're just like yeah, he's like a cool guy [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4790.98s)]
*  Whereas I think liberals are more like what are the facts and what's the data and that's why it gets lost on so many people [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4793.379999999999s)]
*  But they're like well technically this year the energy emissions have been this amount everyone's like well before you talk about [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4798.5s)]
*  But I think people that are into policy are like no that actually makes way more and why are liberals more concerned about that? [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4803.139999999999s)]
*  I don't know. I think jonathan height is research where he's like some people are just like [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4807.94s)]
*  Have an aptitude for change and progress and other people have an aptitude where they're resistant to change [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4811.54s)]
*  And like he literally just defines it as like there's what I think [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4815.94s)]
*  Genetic traits that split generally 50 50 and they kind of shift during culture [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4819.46s)]
*  I mean he wrote about in one of his books. I forget which one [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4823.22s)]
*  But that's what he says that is interesting because I always wonder i'm like [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4825.94s)]
*  Why are people so like they push back when they hear someone's a progressive and i'm like don't you want to progress? [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4829.22s)]
*  Don't you want to try to improve on things? I think the word progress or progressive or tolerance [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4835.3s)]
*  or accepting [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4842.18s)]
*  Has different definitions for different people [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4843.94s)]
*  So I think we all want progress [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4847.22s)]
*  to a certain extent [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4850.0199999999995s)]
*  But progress to some people might be in like shooting kids up with you know gender [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4851.78s)]
*  Affirming hormones without the permission of the parents [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4856.72s)]
*  But they might with their best intentions be like we need to help these kids I I think it might be pure altruism [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4859.9400000000005s)]
*  There might be some like special interest groups that [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4866.820000000001s)]
*  You know no longer can make money off of gay rights [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4869.38s)]
*  So they have to find another thing to make money off of [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4871.62s)]
*  And that's another thing that I don't think people talk about is like if you're like a special interest group [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4874.1s)]
*  And you built your company and it's lobbying to to get rights for black people or gay people once they have rights [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4878.42s)]
*  You don't take the company and dissolve it [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4885.38s)]
*  You have employees [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4888.74s)]
*  You need to find another cause and that's why the republicans fucked up with roe v wade [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4890.58s)]
*  Because all those anti-abortion uh lobbies [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4896.419999999999s)]
*  liked raising money against roe v wade [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4900.419999999999s)]
*  now [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4904.179999999999s)]
*  What do they have to do? [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4905.379999999999s)]
*  We gotta come federally [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4906.9s)]
*  We gotta come for ivf. We got it [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4909.46s)]
*  It was it was actually perfect before [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4912.099999999999s)]
*  Because if if we're talking about the greed people are trying to make money off these guys [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4914.66s)]
*  People exactly they have the boogeyman. They get to push back against a boogeyman. They got rid of the boogeyman now [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4918.42s)]
*  They're like, uh, what else can we now? We got to create a booty bus shitty your boogeyman. Yeah ivf facilities. Yeah [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4923.54s)]
*  Get rid of them, which most modern people are like what the fuck? [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4929.54s)]
*  Yeah [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4932.74s)]
*  So there are there are people who are genuine and authentic about these causes and they really want to you know [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4933.38s)]
*  Expand rights and tolerance for trans people and there are people who are no longer raising money on gay rights [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4938.42s)]
*  And they're like, well, we got to find someone else to fucking raise money on. This is what I do for a living [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4944.18s)]
*  I can't let that salary go away [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4947.46s)]
*  Yeah [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4949.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah, theoretically like an aclu which is I can't you I imagine worth hundreds of millions or whatever [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4950.42s)]
*  They in the 60s if they're formed, there's plenty of real black people have equal rights at all [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4956.02s)]
*  Fast order 2024 for the most part people have rights. There is for sure systemic things [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4960.42s)]
*  Whatever whatever and we can kind of fight against that but it's not really [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4965.14s)]
*  Eh, oh trans issues. Oh these issues. Oh those issues and then you just keep finding new boogeymen [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4968.5s)]
*  I wonder if this is like a function of [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4973.78s)]
*  higher education too [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4976.179999999999s)]
*  like you're part of these institutions and [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4978.26s)]
*  As an educator at these institutions, you're also, you know writing thesis [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4981.62s)]
*  Thesis ease. Yeah, right and like [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4986.4s)]
*  You're just kind of waxing poetic on these ideas. You're not going. Hey, this is the 100% fact, but what if you know, uh, [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4989.7s)]
*  Privilege is intersectional and all these things could affect it. Yada yada yada and these ideas [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=4996.639999999999s)]
*  That are meant to be more I don't want to say hyperbolic but uh, [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5002.740000000001s)]
*  Meant to be more almost like frivolous. It's just food for thought like we're just throwing the bouncing these things around [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5006.820000000001s)]
*  they get taken very seriously by a [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5012.58s)]
*  Uh a group of people who are still seeking out identity and understanding like what their beliefs in the world are like [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5016.5s)]

*  We're not built for no stress. I agree [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5258.419999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like any human beings that have figured out how to not be stressed. They're in a really bad situation [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5260.58s)]

*  Yeah, actually I realized now I need to start taking sleep medication because it's just so bad so that's helped wait [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5298.82s)]
*  Are you taking sleep? Yeah, it's gone up. My last three days been solid six hours. No [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5303.78s)]
*  Tresa don't melatonin child's play. Oh, you're taking anti-psychotic [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5308.72s)]
*  I think it's an anti-depressant. So yeah, I guess no anti-psychotic. Tresa don'ts an antidepressant [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5313.54s)]
*  Pretty sure it's an anti-psychotic might be so it's like an ssri. It's a serotonin receptor antagonist [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5318.26s)]
*  So it's not like an antidepressant nigga you got [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5324.26s)]
*  The fuck you working so maybe i've been depressed. I know this whole time. I thought I was happy [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5327.62s)]

*  Inhibitory re-uptake inhibitor. This is a serotonin antagonist and re-uptake. Yes. It just antagonizes [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5337.46s)]
*  That does make sense. I thought that's what wives do [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5344.179999999999s)]
*  I need two negatives to make it a positive [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5348.82s)]
*  I think you need a grounding man, bro [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5353.62s)]
*  You gotta plug into the earth. I'm sleeping though. No, just don't listen to your wife and do whatever the fuck you want [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5356.82s)]

*  I'm straight. Really? Yeah [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5405.7s)]
*  And is it possible you're just a human being that needs less sleep some human beings need less water [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5407.139999999999s)]
*  I'm kind of retarded. So you never know. I thought you slept a lot [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5412.5s)]
*  No, it's whenever it's like whenever I feel like I want to sleep [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5415.94s)]
*  So like some nights some nights is five some nights is 10 [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5420.099999999999s)]

*  You know freud had his all this stuff with dreams and what dreams mean and like they did all this research on it [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5652.98s)]
*  They're like, yeah, there's nothing to do with that kind of shit. So but he still threw it out there [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5657.38s)]
*  It was still published. It's still being published now. You can still read it [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5661.78s)]
*  So some of the theories that we have are going to be right and some of them aren't but when it becomes [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5665.54s)]
*  like a when it's being educated to young impressionable individuals without [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5670.34s)]
*  The confirmation that this is fact and this is how the world works and [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5677.46s)]
*  they're [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5681.94s)]
*  They're teaching it as if it is [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5683.06s)]
*  What else are they supposed to believe they're not going? Hey, this might be a theory [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5685.38s)]
*  They're going this is how the world works. Don't you agree if you don't agree you might be racist [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5688.82s)]
*  You know what I mean, that's a theory [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5696.66s)]
*  That's how I was educated in my Santa Barbara party school [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5699.14s)]
*  I don't think there's no critical race area in my school at all. I took a black studies class from a white guy [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5703.22s)]
*  That shit was fire. I remember he walked in he was like nothing here [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5709.78s)]
*  Everybody gets an a you know, I did take a black studies from a white dude though, but that's funny [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5717.62s)]
*  Yeah, I remember chappelle show did a sketch genuinely chappelle show did a sketch about like [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5722.26s)]
*  I literally went in there with all these like California like Santa Barbara kids [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5727.7s)]
*  They're like never met a black person and I remember walking that room like god [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5731.62s)]
*  It was it was like when the Spanish kid goes in Spanish class. That's how I felt [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5735.54s)]
*  Let me be a tutor I got you [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5741.62s)]
*  Know [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5743.7s)]
*  Were you in that class with me though [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5752.9s)]
*  No, no, we just took dance together. Yeah, we took history of dance together and econ music label management just basically the same thing. Yeah [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5755.7s)]
*  Okay, go we were saying that chappelle show had the sketch where he did like how well do you know black people and it was [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5764.26s)]
*  Like a black barber a black whatever and then there was a white guy who did black like african-american studies [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5768.34s)]
*  This guy bodied every question was so funny like they asked him about the term chicken head [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5772.66s)]
*  And then he had like some very high level but very accurate definition of what chicken head was [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5776.9s)]
*  So I said to say white black studies teacher works out sometimes right because he what is that? [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5781.7s)]
*  There's another chappelle joke also. He was he got to work extra hard to get the respect [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5786.82s)]
*  If you know what that white dude did to get the black dude's respect [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5791.54s)]
*  You know if you were a studies professor, yeah of a race you are not you're getting grilled you go harsh [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5794.66s)]
*  Yeah, you need an outsider sometimes [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5800.5s)]
*  Because who has the best takes about white people? It's always a black guy facts [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5802.82s)]
*  I was like, you know, does white people say skedaddle. I'm sorry. I do say skedaddle [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5805.7s)]
*  How did he know that? How did he know that about me? That is true. Yeah, best observers are like slightly outside their culture [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5809.54s)]
*  Yeah, so this is the new critical race theory. The only people that are allowed to make black jokes are non-blacks [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5815.9400000000005s)]
*  I like that. I love that but we can't make white jokes only you guys can and other non-whites [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5820.42s)]
*  I mean, we've been doing that already. So there we go. We have a deal and then we can all make asian jokes [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5825.22s)]
*  Is that the idea behind this except asians you hear an asian even utter an asian joke? You got a snack [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5829.7s)]
*  What about when they talk that feels like a similar joke to the way I make it but it's about the delivery. Okay, they do deliver [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5834.42s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. That's what they're talking about when they deliver. Yeah [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5842.34s)]
*  Oh man, those silly asians [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5846.9s)]
*  Oh, they're so silly [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5850.099999999999s)]
*  Hispanics really took over the fucking delivery service. Yeah [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5852.34s)]
*  Yeah, I don't see any more asians delivering shit because y'all were robbing them too much [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5856.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you were yeah, you punch them in the subway. Also, they're like me that's working in office. Yeah, it wasn't us [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5859.78s)]
*  No, you really were you were really bad. You're really bad. They're wearing your uniform. You're wearing your jerseys [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5864.5s)]
*  Somebody would order chinese food and then they knew the order was coming so they would rob the guy [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5871.299999999999s)]
*  That was delivering the food [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5877.38s)]
*  Reigned it all the time, but that was a very common occurrence [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5880.58s)]
*  It wasn't that common. It was very common. Stop with this critical race [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5884.0199999999995s)]
*  Very common. Do you ever feel like we need a new race? [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5888.179999999999s)]
*  Oh, i've been trying to do this for so long. We need a new one and then we just get rid of one that we didn't [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5890.9s)]
*  No, that's not what I was saying. No, no, we don't [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5896.5s)]
*  We just replace one that we all like and everybody's kind of like no, we just add a new one and then [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5898.9s)]
*  Oh, I think we should add a new one. Oh just a completely different one. We all started as black [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5903.78s)]
*  and then I think asians kind of came in and then I think we got like [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5908.58s)]
*  Like central american dark kind of mexican vibe then we got europeans and shit. I don't I don't believe that I don't buy this at all [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5912.26s)]
*  We started out as white. You watching graham hanker? We started out as white [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5918.42s)]
*  No, I can believe we all started off as black [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5923.46s)]
*  But then the detour into asian and then not looking at any asian ever again. The asians are from somewhere else [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5925.14s)]
*  Or it's a concurrent timeline. We the asians do not come from africa enunaki [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5930.26s)]
*  They it might be enunaki before two meteors hit the i almost called the world the united states of america [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5934.58s)]
*  I almost called it the united states of america [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5942.58s)]
*  You will make the world united states of america every now you see a globe that doesn't have america in the middle [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5946.98s)]
*  You go what the fuck is that? I don't get it. What is that planet? I don't get it. I've never seen that planet in my life [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5951.46s)]
*  But what elon should look into [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5956.0199999999995s)]
*  From this episode of nation apocalypse hit the united states of america at the same time or the world as some people call it [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5957.86s)]
*  And in different parts two meteors hit struck each other at the same exact time. Yeah [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5963.86s)]
*  One created those big dick dark skinned people [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5970.9s)]
*  The other one created [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=5975.9400000000005s)]

*  Of all of the alien species [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6006.66s)]

*  The elections you gotta say it four times [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6308.46s)]
*  The election special [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6310.54s)]
*  I bought a pecan queens my my my vanilla sweet cream queens. Yeah, you just say different food [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6312.62s)]
*  My funnel can't queen my queen mexicans [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6319.1s)]
*  Okay, um [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6326.46s)]
*  What else we got y'all? Oh, you're not giving out bread, but we can't get none [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6327.9800000000005s)]
*  Uh, yeah [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6331.66s)]
*  Yeah, what is this? I looked into a little bit because it's going on in all the battleground states and my family lives in [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6332.54s)]
*  Pennsylvania so i'm like yo i'll go get that money. Yeah [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6338.6s)]
*  Same i told my wife. Oh really? Yeah, that's funny. Whoa, she votes in philly. Yeah. Okay, but um [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6342.62s)]
*  So is it legal? Is it not legal? That's what's being discussed. You can't pay for people to register to vote [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6348.78s)]
*  But he's doing a referral program [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6355.18s)]
*  So if you refer somebody you get paid, I think forty seven dollars [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6358.46s)]
*  To refer somebody to go register to vote. That's how he's getting around the legal loophole of things [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6363.0199999999995s)]
*  So how do they prove that that person has registered? [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6367.34s)]
*  That they're probably just taking their word for it or something like that or saying hey this person registered to vote [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6371.900000000001s)]
*  And now if that person now is on the registry they can confirm it that way and then the money gets sent [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6376.78s)]
*  Yeah, so that's one way they're giving out money [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6381.5s)]
*  They're also giving out a hundred dollars to any birth person to sign the petition [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6383.26s)]
*  That just says I believe in the first and second amendment. That's all it is. But why is that important? [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6388.78s)]
*  they [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6395.26s)]
*  The only people that qualify are people who are registered to vote. Oh [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6396.62s)]
*  God, so I also understand what that does like walk me down what that means what that does [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6399.82s)]
*  Involved it gets them to register to vote. They're incentivizing registration. Yes, but they can't say that they're [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6405.34s)]
*  Incentivizing or paying for registration. So it's like hey, i'm paying you to just sign this position petition [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6411.56s)]
*  But in order to sign the petition you have to be registered vote [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6416.7s)]
*  So that's why this shit is a little it's just that's still easier than voting and like mailing something [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6419.9s)]
*  I just gotta go online. I think the idea is like increasing registrations will increase attendance [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6423.9s)]
*  Yes, because a lot of people get to the point where they want to vote and they're like, oh wait [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6429.339999999999s)]
*  I had to register tomorrow and I missed it [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6432.62s)]
*  Like it's crazy like I usually pretend I want to vote and I do all that stuff only like 50 to 60 percent of [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6435.179999999999s)]
*  American vote [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6440.7s)]
*  Mm-hmm. Yeah, we have the lowest voter turnout in like any western country. You're fucking horrible [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6441.82s)]
*  Are you voting have you decided who you're voting for? Yeah [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6448.94s)]
*  You already know he's very reluctant he's not happy about voting for you study for this [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6452.14s)]
*  Yeah, i'm voting on bone jump guys bone jump red hat [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6456.7s)]
*  Funny people be in an ad [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6463.66s)]
*  I was joking around when I said that they paid me a 50 000 licensing fee [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6474.7s)]
*  There is no licensing fee for using your podcast content in an ad maybe there should be I don't know [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6478.22s)]
*  But these fucking retard journalists that need a story about everything [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6483.42s)]
*  Have a story out there with the headline comedian. Andrew schultz gets paid [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6488.700000000001s)]
*  $50,000 by kamala campaign to use his likeness in an ad and it says he's donating it to the donald trump campaign or whatever [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6493.400000000001s)]
*  It's fire. I mean it's just it's fire. So where'd you get the money to donate? [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6501.26s)]
*  Say something now, let's make another another another hot line. Um, I will be donating [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6504.62s)]
*  Uh alex's entire salary to the kamala harris campaign because I know that that's not getting much [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6512.0599999999995s)]
*  But I know that's where he would want that money to go [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6522.54s)]
*  That is the most important place for it. Obviously he's making trillions of dollars over there at wtf [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6524.62s)]
*  He doesn't need this money. What's more important is that he maintains democracy. I'll obviously with your cosign [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6528.86s)]
*  Love democracy, you know, I cosign i'm cosign i'm doing it. We're doing it. Yeah [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6533.82s)]
*  We're doing it it's been cosigned and that you know, your word is your bond. Yeah [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6539.98s)]
*  And honestly, that is a beautiful thing that you would do that. It's a democracy for hey, you know what if she loses [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6544.7s)]
*  Don't worry about it. We'll just pay you anyway [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6551.259999999999s)]
*  Is that a good thing I think so, yeah [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6555.66s)]
*  So if she wins, you don't get paid if she loses you get paid [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6558.38s)]
*  Oh, that's cold [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6562.06s)]
*  Okay, um [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6567.26s)]
*  Coffeezilla going at tate. Yeah, so I was looking into this. So dangerous man that coffee. Yeah. Yeah, you don't want him don't [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6568.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you don't want him on the suspenders. If he puts the suspenders on your ass is toast [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6575.26s)]
*  Yeah, you see that million dollar studio, bro [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6580.620000000001s)]
*  It's a problem [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6583.5s)]
*  So I think five six days ago andrew tate just starts going off on coffeezilla [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6585.26s)]
*  And he i'll get to what he said, but he shows an email coffeezilla says hey [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6590.0s)]
*  I'm doing an investigation on you and your relationship with crypto. Would you mind answering these questions for me? [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6594.719999999999s)]
*  Also, if you can answer them quickly, I would love to put your response in the video [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6598.96s)]
*  And it's fairly clear from the questions that coffeezilla got him dead to rights. So he's not [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6602.08s)]
*  very happy about it and the reason he's questioning him is [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6606.719999999999s)]
*  Andrew tate has always been very anti like shit coin in particular [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6609.759999999999s)]
*  You don't really say much about bitcoin or theory or that but like these shit coins he's adamantly opposed to it [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6612.96s)]
*  I'll never do it. I don't need to rob my fans all this shit. He'll say he'll say like, you know [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6617.44s)]
*  Hey, let's say you you gasp a shit coin at ten cents and one of your if you get one of your fans to buy it [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6622.16s)]
*  He might make money if you sell it for ten dollars [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6627.44s)]
*  But that's still that guy that bought it for ten dollars is gonna lose money and that guy's probably an andrew tate fan [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6629.759999999999s)]
*  So I would never rob my fans like that [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6634.32s)]
*  Then all of a sudden he just starts saying like, you know what the problem was with these coins [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6636.88s)]
*  They they it's never done right. I'm gonna change crypto. I'm gonna make sure it's done correctly [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6641.28s)]
*  Before it's always these rug pulls and these scams and people stay anonymous like pussies [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6646.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm changing that and then he starts advertising this coin called roost this shit coin. He's doing like ads for it [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6650.56s)]
*  There's flyers all over the place. All of a sudden he's putting in his live streams and sure enough [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6655.68s)]
*  Everything that he said was going to change about crypto does not change with a roost [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6660.0s)]
*  It goes up and then drops by 90 percent [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6663.2s)]
*  The uh, like the wallet that all the money is being held in gets hacked [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6665.92s)]
*  And the guy who was holding the roost coin wallet was anonymous. So everything that he said he didn't like [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6670.56s)]
*  About crypto and he was gonna change immediately. So it got hacked. Yeah. Yeah, in other words [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6675.679999999999s)]
*  They may or may not have rug pulled. Oh, they yeah very yeah [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6680.88s)]
*  We don't know for a fact that they're rug pulled but I think that's what coffee zilla is alluding to [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6684.4s)]
*  Well, I was saying he's saying I think the rug pulls just a 90 crash [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6688.16s)]
*  In price, but yeah, that's also that's not yeah, you could be rug pulls when you pull your money out before [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6691.679999999999s)]
*  Okay, so yeah, so those guys got scammed. Yeah, they got the rug pulls. You you know boost up the coin pump it [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6696.639999999999s)]
*  And then it's anonymous so yeah, how do you but the hacking is interesting [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6701.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's because that's a really smart way of looking at it if you want to do something shy see [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6705.4400000000005s)]
*  Because what you're essentially doing is [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6710.240000000001s)]
*  You're not taking any accountability for the fact that it was pulled and they can't follow that money anywhere [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6712.64s)]
*  Oh, he's not dumb. This guy this guy [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6717.200000000001s)]
*  Dummies, yeah, he's very sad how he makes his money. He also suddenly starts advertising all these other coins [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6720.320000000001s)]
*  So he'll have tweets. It's like I will never never endorse a crypto [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6726.56s)]
*  But then he's endorsing like a daddy coin some shit coin some fuck madonna's coin shit coin [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6730.24s)]
*  And then somebody responds to one of his quote tweets his tweet saying I will never endorse crypto [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6734.96s)]
*  I'll never get paid for promotion the guy goes. Hey, man. We both literally got paid to promote the same [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6739.04s)]
*  Crypto, I know for a fact you got paid almost a million dollars [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6744.16s)]
*  Wow to promote this crypto to pump this crypto and then someone leaks a screenshot of him saying to him [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6747.36s)]
*  I tried to get barren to give me the trump coin at a discounted price so I could pump up the price for him [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6752.5599999999995s)]
*  So like clearly he's in it [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6756.88s)]
*  But then coffeezilla is saying his big like kind of scammy thing is what he's doing with his own crypto [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6758.64s)]
*  I think the coin is called the real world, but I know it's tied into what hustlers university [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6764.240000000001s)]
*  He changed the name to the real world that educational platform and this is fucking smart, dude [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6769.04s)]
*  You know the main problem with a subscription service, especially especially a an expensive one 50 dollars a month is churn [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6773.360000000001s)]
*  People will subscribe and unsubscribe. So tate has been trying to find ways to keep people in [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6779.76s)]
*  How do you get them to not unsubscribe for 50 dollars a month? I don't want to lose that money [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6784.0s)]
*  So what he does is he creates this crypto coin and he says you guys who have this crypto will get dividends from the real world [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6787.84s)]
*  Education service and you can move up and rank the more crypto you have and it's all based on chess. Obviously [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6794.88s)]
*  pawn knight bishop [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6800.88s)]
*  Rook and king and what a few commenters pointed out is very funny [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6802.88s)]
*  He left out queen the queen the most powerful piece [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6805.52s)]
*  But he's such a he's got such a fucking loser man thing that he makes the king the top and the king is arguably [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6808.080000000001s)]
*  The most useless piece on the chess board [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6813.68s)]
*  Like you can't even sack you can sacrifice a pawn a king. You gotta fucking move everything around for this weak bitch [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6816.0s)]
*  But then he says this is what's smart [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6821.200000000001s)]
*  He goes if you unsubscribe from the real world education service at all [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6823.040000000001s)]
*  You lose all of your power points all of your ranking and you start getting a smaller percentage of your crypto from the dividends [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6827.360000000001s)]
*  You go from if you're a rook it don't if you're a king it don't matter you drop all the way back down [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6834.080000000001s)]
*  To pawn if you unsubscribe for one month. So now he makes money on the crypto [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6837.84s)]
*  And he maintains he maintains subscriptions really smart [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6842.56s)]
*  What what is he? [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6846.08s)]
*  How does how do they get paid with the dividends? How does that work? [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6847.68s)]
*  So I guess he just and then that's up to him really based on how much crypto you have he decides what percentage? [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6850.320000000001s)]
*  Of dividends you get paid what are dividends like from from the house from the money he makes from so like let's say [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6855.52s)]
*  Hustlers university the real world. Let's say it's making a million dollars a month [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6861.52s)]
*  You get some prescription or some percentage of that million dollar because there's still a subscription fee [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6864.88s)]
*  Yeah, and on top of the subscription fee you also buy these fake crypto coins that they just created and that just determines what percentage [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6870.32s)]
*  You're spending 50 a month, but you could be making [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6878.8s)]
*  Ten dollars back like how he says you can make 500 a month back or whatever [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6882.16s)]
*  And it's the same thing what he did last time. It's like they make money by getting other people assigned [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6886.56s)]
*  It's the same mlm just the same pyramid [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6890.56s)]
*  He does a nice little graphic copyzilla of like [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6893.12s)]
*  Like low rank high rank king and then the high ranking makes a lot of money from and it's just another it's just another pyramid [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6895.2s)]
*  And then here's what's even this is how much this guy's how good he is at making money [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6901.76s)]
*  Even when he responds to coffee what he says he leaks coffee zilla's email on his live stream or whatever and says [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6905.44s)]
*  Everybody email him and this is actually funny to me to call him gay [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6911.36s)]
*  And for every person that emails coffeezilla and calls him gay I will buy more daddy coin [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6914.96s)]
*  And what that's gonna do is probably inflate the price of daddy coin [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6921.280000000001s)]
*  And if you're a guy being like oh andrew chate is so popular [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6925.84s)]
*  I should buy more daddy coin because he's gonna buy a bunch of daddy coin that [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6929.280000000001s)]
*  Increases the price and then he can sell that and then when it plummets who gives a fuck [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6932.240000000001s)]
*  He makes money at every turn doing this. Yeah, he also said oh for every dislike on coffeezilla's video [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6935.280000000001s)]
*  Video i'll buy some more daddy coin and this is what's gonna drive him crazy dog [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6941.360000000001s)]
*  If you look at the comments on coffee's video, it's overwhelmed. I don't see a single negative comment [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6944.96s)]
*  So I don't think tate has the pull and power and influence that he used to and that alone will drive him insane [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6949.28s)]
*  He might still have it but it definitely ain't what it was two three years ago. Even on youtube [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6956.24s)]
*  It's not that dude on youtube if you look at the comments [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6959.68s)]
*  Unless they're going through and deleting them right away. They're probably over on rumble, right? [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6962.16s)]
*  Because he can't stream on youtube but they can all go to youtube and just leave a negative comment. Yeah, but you can [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6965.36s)]
*  Block for negative comments [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6970.8s)]
*  Yeah, maybe also I think coffee's audience are probably people that hate scams and shit [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6972.8s)]
*  Yeah, well I would just think the tate crowd would make a toy [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6977.28s)]
*  You know, yeah like that had the most dislikes of any other coffeezilla video [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6981.04s)]
*  So it worked a little bit but it was only I think when I checked 1400 dislikes [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6985.68s)]
*  So not much that's but still more than any other video [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6989.92s)]
*  So 1400 you would think if you're if trump said go dislike a coffee video. It's getting [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6993.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, you know what I mean? [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=6999.28s)]
*  so where does he pivot to be is now like [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7000.96s)]
*  the [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7003.6s)]
*  Manasphere thing is drying up like just yelling at women on a podcast thing is kind of over. Yeah [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7004.56s)]
*  It seems like the online discourse the grifters have definitely shifted to like the manasphere [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7010.320000000001s)]
*  grifters have definitely shifted to [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7016.4800000000005s)]
*  Israel palestine and they're just like rah rah rah [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7018.56s)]
*  Palestine like they are beating their chest fuck the jews and they're doing it like the most toxic way [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7022.88s)]
*  So as toxic as they were with the women they are towards jews. Yeah [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7027.52s)]
*  Um, it's annoying because they don't really give a fuck about palestine. They're just doing they just need something for views [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7032.08s)]
*  And then if you actually want palestine to have any you're just every person who's jewish is like look how much anti-semitism and there's [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7036.72s)]
*  Actually, they do a huge disservice to the palestinian movement by just conflating it with jews in general because their conversation [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7042.64s)]
*  To get that same stickiness. They have to make it about all jews and the jewish people and this is what they do exactly [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7049.52s)]
*  Because the nuance is not what people go to them for anyway. Yeah, and uh, so yeah, so that [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7056.240000000001s)]
*  I guess the manasphere kind of drives up. What is the yeah? [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7061.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean to be honest, I think that's why he converted to islam. It's just another grift [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7064.8s)]
*  He saw the grift. He just saw it in advance like yeah, it's that's what annoyed me about the whole thing [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7068.4800000000005s)]
*  I think this guy's just grift to grift to grift [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7073.4400000000005s)]
*  You could just be a funny person who can kick someone's ass [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7076.08s)]
*  You know, I mean you can probably make a decent amount of money doing that. Yeah, but it's just grift to grift to grift [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7079.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think his next thing will be a gold sneaker [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7084.08s)]
*  Yeah [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7086.639999999999s)]
*  Our president [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7093.04s)]
*  What happened with his lawsuits that's your president too, yeah, you're voting for where's your sneaks? I don't see none of your boy's sneaks [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7096.24s)]
*  They were sold out. Yeah, my son. I keep mine in a glass case [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7102.5599999999995s)]
*  It's actually great great point. That's a good thing to do. That's respect what happened with his lawsuits [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7106.24s)]
*  Yeah, do you know what happened with his like the sex trafficking shit? [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7111.5199999999995s)]
*  He got arrested by romanian officials still under investigation. He got new charges [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7114.08s)]
*  Even more but they can't get anything to stick [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7118.4s)]
*  No, I think they're still building case [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7121.6s)]
*  Like nothing has been dropped yet [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7123.6s)]
*  Are you sure I think the initial ones were dropped? No, i'm almost [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7126.08s)]
*  Nothing this at the beginning of his video too [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7130.08s)]
*  There's like definitionally what he describes himself as having done is a form of sex trafficking where he says like I get girls who fall [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7131.92s)]
*  In love with me and then I'm in it [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7139.12s)]
*  I get them to do like webcam shit [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7141.28s)]
*  And then I think get them to do sexual things that they might not want to do if they didn't love me [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7143.36s)]
*  And that is a form of I think sweetheart there's some term that is used as like a this is a form of sex trafficking [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7147.04s)]
*  Right, you gotta prove actually today. He could just be saying he could just be talking shit on a podcast to get views. That's the other thing [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7152.88s)]
*  obviously, it feels like the justice department out there in Romania is uh [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7159.599999999999s)]
*  Is going after him now they might be going after him because he did some illegal shit [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7164.48s)]
*  They might be going after him because they're like, why are we harboring this dude that is [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7169.759999999999s)]
*  Kind of making us look foolish and making it look like you can do whatever the fuck you want in our country and we're a respectable [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7173.28s)]
*  Place and we have dignity and laws and this guy is running around in fancy cars smoking cigars saying the word corrupt [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7178.879999999999s)]
*  You can buy the legal system [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7184.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of insulting and like if you're doing that you could do that in america [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7185.839999999999s)]
*  You could talk all the shit you want in america [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7189.44s)]
*  Right and probably things won't go that bad for you. Maybe if you're in politics you have to deal with some shakedown [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7191.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, but it'll be like sec fuck you. I'm a scammer. Like he's just talking these motherfuckers [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7196.96s)]
*  Yeah, and you do that in romania and they go well, we'll see about that. Yeah [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7202.48s)]
*  Yeah [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7206.08s)]

*  Have you ever seen this does he look like me? He looks exactly like you damn it [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7210.799999999999s)]
*  Have you ever have we never talked about this? [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7214.96s)]
*  Damn it, I look like every white old person look at that guy [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7217.52s)]
*  It's kind of similar. He actually looks more like aaron rogers to me than anything. It looks like dub [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7222.08s)]
*  That's anti-semitic. You're why you're grifting bro. Why are you always doing that? [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7227.2s)]
*  Are you jumping on it? You and dove had a baby? That's that's it right there. Oh, yeah [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7231.12s)]

*  I'm now at an age where when you say how old you are [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7281.76s)]
*  People clap and that's depressing. However [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7285.6s)]

*  Yeah, basically it's not a great look [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7305.68s)]
*  I mean it's unfortunate he put out a statement since basically being like my heart is broken like this young boy that I met [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7307.68s)]
*  That I tried to give the world has now fallen prey to you know addiction and shit like that [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7312.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, is that the issue with him? He was on drugs [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7316.64s)]
*  That's what it seems like. Yeah, all the evidence points to that. They found what they call pink cocaine in his system [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7318.96s)]
*  To see yeah, yeah, which apparently is not cocaine at all [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7324.24s)]
*  What is it's just like meth basically like everything i've read is like there's no real definition exactly what pink cocaine is like [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7328.08s)]
*  There's a ton of different explanations for like what's in it and then people call it to see even though [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7333.84s)]
*  It doesn't really have the same make it was to see it's like no one really knows what the fuck it is [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7338.16s)]
*  And what exactly he was on? [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7341.76s)]
*  Yeah, how do you do it? What does it do? I thought it was supposed to be coke and molly [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7343.36s)]
*  That's what to see is definition. Yeah mark. You don't have any uh [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7348.4s)]
*  To see why I just have I just have to see I mean that's why you don't have any zy n's though [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7352.320000000001s)]
*  No, no fresh out. She's fresh out. I'm off that bro. Ever since I became a deadbeat. I'm I don't do that anymore [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7357.04s)]
*  You're not a deadbeat. Are you actually a deadbeat? I think you're having out with your kid all the time [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7362.64s)]
*  I got a deadbeat kid bro. He doesn't want to ever kick with me [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7366.56s)]
*  That's really what it is. We're talking about deadbeat parents never talk about deadbeat kids [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7369.92s)]
*  I don't want to call their dad hang out with them. That's fucked up, right? Oh, maybe that was me. That's what i'm saying [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7373.2s)]
*  Why do kids ever take accountability? [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7378.56s)]
*  No, this is messed up. He cries when I hold him [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7381.92s)]
*  I walk around with him [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7384.400000000001s)]
*  That actually is very patronizing when you walk around with your kid and people look at you and they're like, what are you doing with him? [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7385.52s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like it's very it's like infantilized and they look at me [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7390.88s)]
*  They're like you're not supposed to have a kid [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7393.4400000000005s)]
*  And then they treat you like oh, yeah, you're in new york. Yeah, so people look at you and they're like, oh that's so like [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7395.2s)]
*  You guys no, they probably are because they think you're gay. So they're like [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7400.56s)]
*  It could be a male thing like you never see men with kids [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7404.8s)]
*  Like I went to the park with shiloh and people look at me like I was weird did I tell you this? No [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7408.16s)]
*  they're like [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7412.64s)]
*  did he [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7413.68s)]
*  capture that kid like [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7414.64s)]
*  You don't see the only men you see with kids are grandparents. So they see me [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7416.64s)]
*  With my daughter who's too young to even be at the park [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7421.52s)]
*  And they're like what the fuck is going on here? That's people do to me. They're like, where's the where's the mom? [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7425.04s)]
*  Yeah, like why is it what why does it matter bro? Dads don't really be with their kids, bro [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7429.04s)]
*  They'll be with their wife and their kid but just dad and kid is a rare sighting [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7433.76s)]
*  Yeah, you don't realize it until you've got one you're looking for other ones and they're nowhere to be found [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7438.48s)]
*  It's a peculiar thing but the amount of attention you guys are insane. I mean shut down the park shut it down [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7444.16s)]
*  I feel like I was fucking one direction dude. It's crazy people walking up to you like they want to see the kid [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7449.36s)]
*  They're like asking you questions. That's why you're going on all these walks alone. Yeah [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7454.24s)]
*  Yeah [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7458.639999999999s)]

*  Just like I can't get this tension on stage. I'm gonna get this attention [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz2CTOUZ5NU&t=7465.36s)]
