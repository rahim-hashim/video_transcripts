*  You know lying in his specials or about the stories in his specials [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=47.22s)]
*  Is that like if you know his real life? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=50.900000000000006s)]
*  He has like these he has these insane things that have happened to him like completely separate [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=53.16s)]
*  Like when he came to America, it was on a boat with a tiger did really did you guys know dude? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=57.92s)]

*  He was like lost at sea and it was him and a tiger on a boat and they like forged [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=66.28s)]
*  They forged this like real friendship. That's crazy. Cuz that okay that [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=71.56s)]
*  Makes perfect sense because the tiger yeah, I went before he came here. I know he grew up in a jungle [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=77.2s)]
*  Bunch of animals raised him [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=84.56s)]
*  Tiger he must have made good with tigers. Yeah tiger was a real enemy. Yeah, they should they should make a movie on his life [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  They could do he told me this one story about like going to White Castle with his Asian friend and it was like [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=97.44000000000001s)]
*  It was one of the most unbelievable stories I've ever heard. It was like so many shenanigans [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  Or I'm gonna get in galore and I'm like why not do that, you know, tell the thing about how he really made his money [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  He won who wants to be a millionaire? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=114.06s)]
*  Yeah, and just talk about that. That's how he met his wife [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=117.56s)]
*  Dude that you can play off of anyway [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=122.32s)]
*  Anyway, so many things out there, but listen, you know tons of material for him to still mine for all of you [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=126.2s)]
*  That are confused right now news has come out. There's a New Yorker article that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=132.44s)]
*  Hassan minhaj [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=137.64s)]
*  May have been fabricating some things in his Netflix specials wait, but Andrew. Yes [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=140.4s)]
*  Comedians make up stories all the time. That's true [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=147.4s)]
*  Now usually we do it to make things funnier [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=150.24s)]
*  Yeah, not make things more racist or sad. Yeah or emotional [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=155.24s)]
*  Yeah, and I think that's the tricky thing here with with like in his stories [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=160.1s)]
*  It's not like he was using these exaggerations or hyperbole as punchlines [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=164.22s)]
*  He was using them to kind of make the audience feel worse about him [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=169.3s)]
*  And then it turns out these things didn't actually happen. Yeah, he made life worse for other people in real life [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=173.57999999999998s)]
*  Oh wait, how is that? Have you you know the prom story, right? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=180.18s)]
*  What's the prom story prom story the homecoming king is based on this story that he was supposed to go to prom with a white girl [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, got to the door. She's putting a corsage on another a guy a white guy [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=189.06s)]
*  Her parents didn't like the fact that Hassan was Indian. Hmm, and that's terrible terrible story. Yeah lady response [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=192.9s)]
*  And it's like not only is this not true he asked me days before the prom [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=204.82s)]
*  I just said no and not only are my parents not racist. I'm married to an Indian, but here's the thing and this is like [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=208.35999999999999s)]
*  This is the problem when you lie in your specials is like that girl had to marry an Indian [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=215.34s)]
*  So that people wouldn't think she was a face. Yeah, just to say so away. Hassan actually helped Indians. Yeah, he did [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=223.29999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, he might be a hero the ultimate [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=228.9s)]
*  Got to marry an Indian. Yeah, you would say got to you would say got right right right, but the rest of us would be like [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=233.22s)]
*  You gotta put in on this [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=240.06s)]
*  First thing she says she's like, I'm not racist. I married an Indian. She had to fucking do it because he bullied her into [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=243.06s)]
*  I do like this idea that if a girl rejects me she's racist cuz there's a lot of racist brown girls that I didn't know [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=249.1s)]
*  I see this girl cuz he's handsome [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=254.58s)]
*  Hassan is handsome. He is he is he is a handsome man gray fucking hair. Mm-hmm [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=256.58s)]
*  We have to look at this girl. She might be racist, bro [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=260.94s)]
*  She might be ugly enough where she's racist [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=263.22s)]
*  Or we got to see what this white dude that she went to prom look like. Oh, I think we need to do a little research [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=265.46s)]
*  Oh, I think we need to do a little research. I think we might have to defend his son [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=271.62s)]
*  He might be right about that one. She might have been racist. Okay, okay [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=275.86s)]
*  Got it [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=278.62s)]
*  Bro, I need to have that level of confidence bro [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=280.34000000000003s)]
*  Where if you don't like me you're racist the only way you could not like don't you wish actively wish you had that she got to [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=283.06s)]
*  Be fat. She's gotta be fat. This girl gotta be fat. There's no way that she's a cutie [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=288.3s)]
*  Cuz he got to think he's doing her a favor and then when she says no, he's like, oh this bitch racist [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=292.66s)]
*  Yeah, but why say I went to the door you didn't go to the door. This was crazy [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=298.42s)]
*  He told me that story like that's the most in the years ago. I'm here for vagina and bump [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=302.94s)]
*  Now show up we just text you nicely wait, he told you the story in real life [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=309.38s)]
*  Yeah, like we were cool time ago. I'm talking like 2012, but he and I used to be friends [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=314.22s)]
*  I kind of realized this whatever he put this I didn't know this is a lie [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=319.98s)]
*  I thought all the reasons I don't fuck with this guy is one one of them. We're sitting at a fucking diner [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=323.84000000000003s)]
*  Story as a trauma story. I'm dead ass. I believe that this whole time he was working it out [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=330.42s)]
*  Son that's the craziest shit. Yeah, we're just eating in and out bro. Why you gotta lie to me? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=336.1s)]
*  You know what? You probably said something like you went to their house [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=340.5s)]
*  And he was like, I gotta keep that part. That was good [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=344.78000000000003s)]
*  So he said I got to the door this is any joke to get me on his side obviously [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=348.34000000000003s)]
*  He's like so I can't trust white women and I was like, yeah dog that makes sense [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=352.86s)]
*  Well, I will be I remember when he said what his parents her parents said to him [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=356.04s)]
*  It's just not a good fit and then I remember being like that. Okay [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=360.62s)]
*  Well, your parents would say the exact same thing. It's just not a good fit [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=363.86s)]
*  Like this is what both your parents would say that more [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=367.94s)]
*  Your parents be like fuck you thinking man. It's not a good fit. She's not the same country [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=371.42s)]
*  Not the same race not the same faith. What's going on? That's not a good fit Matt in Congress [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=375.86s)]
*  Yeah, so I do remember thinking that and then now he's happily married happily married [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=380.82s)]
*  Which is probably what if he was with that white girl? Yeah white devil and that white devil is now married to an Indian miserable [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=386.38s)]
*  Ended up working in his favor. It turns lying kind of works for him lies [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=393.86s)]
*  I think I think one of the things that we have to really separate is is there are comedians that plenty of us all of us [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=400.94s)]
*  Exaggerate things in our jokes to be funny. Yeah, or change things. That's that joke. I did the the not fuck me joke [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=407.58000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I tell us I was at a hotel with my boy about that didn't happen a hotel [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=414.7s)]
*  We were at the Selca and case [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=419.21999999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah, and one of our friends the case goes yeah [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=421.86s)]
*  I go yeah, you can just crash in my place if you want to go home and he goes yeah [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=425.09999999999997s)]
*  But what and I and we can sleep I had to tell her put the pillows and I was like, yeah [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=427.82s)]
*  Or you could not fuck me in the joke. It's funnier to just make it in a hotel [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=430.9s)]
*  Absolutely, so we change these things to make parts of the joke funnier. Yes. It's a completely different thing [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=434.76s)]
*  It's jussie smollett when you are lying about victimization [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=440.38s)]
*  Yeah, so I don't like it when people are starting out to target other comics who have things are exactly true in this [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=443.46000000000004s)]
*  This is not comic. He's not lying about the funny part. Yeah, if he was like if he found a way [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=450.1s)]
*  To the anthrax and the daughter think is crazy. I mean, what is that? What is that in retrospect? It's funny as hell [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=455.74s)]
*  Knowing that he was lying about that the idea that this guy wasn't the funniest [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=465.46000000000004s)]
*  There's pure comedy in this but actually every part is funny if you realize none of it is true [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=470.42s)]
*  The whole thing is hilarious. This is the greatest comic ever [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=475.65999999999997s)]
*  I think bro, but think about he got to do the what is it called when you make fun of the president? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=479.3s)]
*  White House Correspondents Dinner. Yeah [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=484.46s)]
*  Getting sent anthrax levels you up because they only send that to important people to the boss [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=491.38s)]
*  Flex that was a dope move [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=496.58s)]
*  And what's his face got a shot to he said? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=499.14s)]
*  So he he conflated some timelines to make what he went through a little bit more serious [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=502.3s)]
*  He was making fun of I think the Saudis or something and I have less of an issue with this actually. Oh, that's fine [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=507.26s)]
*  That's fine. I'm just telling the people so so I guess in one of the stories [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=512.58s)]
*  He was like making fun of the Saudis and then he had a meeting because he wanted to interview [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=516.18s)]
*  Mbs who's Mohammed bin Salim? I think his name is he is the guy who runs the Saudi [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=519.78s)]
*  What is it PIF it's called or PLF? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=525.14s)]

*  He went to go meet with them [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=532.7s)]
*  and I guess he left and everybody was freaking out because he said the same day cuz Shoghi was chopped up at the Saudi [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=534.1s)]
*  Embassy in Turkey. Mm-hmm, right and people are going. Oh my god. Is everything okay? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=539.9000000000001s)]

*  Yes, that that happened in the moment [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=646.32s)]
*  Because most comedians are awkward as fuck in the moment and they're not gonna come up with that line and that's why they'll go [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=648.84s)]
*  Home and they'll sit in the shower for an hour and think about what they would have said [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=653.6400000000001s)]

*  Comedy is actually that like if you look at old like borscht belt stuff like the one-liners like take my wife, please [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1702.14s)]

*  Bernie Mac talking about his three kids. Yeah, what he would do to the three kids. He's talking about hitting them [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1763.02s)]
*  That's the emotional truth. I don't think he's beating up these little fucking kids [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1767.3400000000001s)]
*  Let's say he is let's say for example, he is not doing anything [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1776.1000000000001s)]
*  But he recognizes the emotional truth is it's funny to say that he will beat him to the white meat [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1779.46s)]
*  He's not gonna beat you until that but it's funnier. Yeah funnier to say it [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1783.96s)]
*  So I don't like that even being pulled in there cuz that's pure stand-up pure stand-up is not [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1787.7s)]
*  Lying about victimization. Yes, and then not satisfying it with a joke. Mm-hmm like that. Yeah, I don't like that [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1793.0600000000002s)]
*  One other thing with a son I just feel like looks great and he's just a handsome so handsome and a hairline [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1800.5800000000002s)]
*  It's fantastic. How fantastic? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1805.8600000000001s)]
*  I like I like oh, I she was racist [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1808.74s)]
*  She was fucking racist Hassan and don't you ever forget it? Yeah, okay really fucking bothers me [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1812.22s)]
*  Yeah, dude, but they really fucking bother because he became like so ingratiated with the Hollywood machine [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1817.46s)]
*  I also think people are taking it harder on him [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1823.66s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1825.8200000000002s)]
*  Like if so, it's like Hollywood you're using him. Yeah like as the latest I [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1826.66s)]
*  think he can be seen as a [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1833.22s)]
*  Agent of like liberal media and as a result, there's all these people on the right that are ready to like go at him [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1835.5s)]
*  No matter what I don't even they really care about I bet you most of them didn't see this but he's just a tool [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1840.74s)]
*  Yeah, he's just a tool for them to hammer away at liberal media [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1844.46s)]
*  He also used them to get we I mean like he wasn't he used it to get where he was and placated them and played to them [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1848.26s)]
*  To them at all times. I think you should always be [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1855.76s)]
*  wary of and this is on the right or the left anybody that [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1859.08s)]
*  100% toes the company line or the party line [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1862.04s)]
*  Oh, yeah, or and then last time it's not even party because I think cuz the Hassan would push back against Democrats [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1865.44s)]
*  I was he pushed back against Republicans [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1870.32s)]
*  But if the if your philosophy is liberal or Republican only a hundred percent [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1871.74s)]
*  You should always be a little bit skeptical of what's going on here because oftentimes that's more of a [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1877.6s)]
*  Costume that you're wearing for financial gain and [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1884.32s)]
*  Both sides this happens on both sides and the people who are gonna still go to his shows are gonna be okay with the [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1888.16s)]
*  Fact that it was lies because it serves the truth that they want to hear exactly exactly [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1892.84s)]
*  So yeah, that's something like you said always be wary of I'm sure you've done this a thousand times [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1898.0s)]
*  But there were certain people on the right wing that wanted to interview me when bring back who came out and I was like [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1902.76s)]
*  No, you got your fucking mind. You think I'm doing that cuz I'm not gonna be your puppet [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1906.9s)]
*  Yeah, you're not gonna do this to me where you want an agenda and then you wrote me into it and then I'm a part [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1910.16s)]
*  Of it. No, I'm gonna be an independent human being who thinks straight [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1914.76s)]
*  Yeah, and I think if you do that you're gonna get fucked whenever by the other side whenever the truth comes up [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1917.48s)]
*  Look at that integrity just [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1922.5s)]
*  digging [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1924.68s)]
*  I'm a hero [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1927.52s)]
*  But I think this I think this a lot of times it happens and the problem is that he did create some really beautiful art [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1930.44s)]
*  Like I remember watching the first special and it was beautiful [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1935.5600000000002s)]
*  It was really great like the way that they did it and it was just really good and [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1938.56s)]
*  But I think I think the problem is is like, you know, we talked about this before it's like when you're focused on art [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1944.3999999999999s)]
*  You'll try to stay true and authentic to that art. Yeah, and I think when people get caught up in [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1950.8s)]
*  success or the addiction for fame [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1957.8s)]
*  You do anything you can to feed that the coolest thing you did after [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1961.8799999999999s)]
*  Infamous is six months off of stage six months because I wanted it to be pure [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1966.0800000000002s)]
*  I want to find the next and we're doing that was so different and so cool [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1970.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's not happening if you're chasing something besides the art. Yeah 100% and [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1973.52s)]
*  Listen, we've got some some huge advantages. We have a very successful podcast [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1978.3200000000002s)]
*  that is gonna pay the bills so we have the ability where we can take time off and [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1983.68s)]
*  find out [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1988.88s)]
*  The next thing that we're passionate about how we want our art to be reflected [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1990.24s)]
*  Like what we really want to write about and that takes fucking time if you just go right back into it [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1994.64s)]
*  you're just gonna rewrite the same version of the last thing you did and [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=1999.6000000000001s)]
*  So I think we should take advantage not everybody has that there's some people they just need to keep pounding the road kids [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2004.44s)]
*  They got fucking kids. They got mortgages. They gotta keep doing it. So [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2008.6000000000001s)]
*  But this is I think this is a good example of wow that works so well, how can we beat that? [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2012.6000000000001s)]
*  What if I don't have a story that's as good as that? Let's say the first one was real [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2017.3600000000001s)]
*  What did you don't have another story that's as good as that? Yeah. Well, that's what people want to deliver that [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2020.92s)]
*  We've shit on her on this pod and all that but I'll say this I watch Hannah Gatsby's both both are specials [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2026.3200000000002s)]
*  The second one she said something was very self-aware [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2031.5s)]
*  She was like dude if I had known trauma was gonna make me so much money [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2033.04s)]
*  I wouldn't use it all up in the first thing and that immediately makes you trust her where you're like [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2036.16s)]
*  Oh, she at least acknowledges and now she's then she just does like the second one is like a comedy special [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2040.52s)]
*  It's hers, but it's not like some trommedy thing [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2045.72s)]
*  It is just like we're trying to be funny whatever it's personal [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2048.32s)]
*  But like I respect trying to do it differently than exactly and if you found out that Hannah [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2051.0800000000004s)]
*  Didn't tell the truth about that about the things that she had so much success with [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2056.0s)]
*  Obviously there would there be like this icky feeling [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2060.44s)]
*  Yeah [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2062.84s)]
*  and I also think putting the person out like if [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2063.2000000000003s)]
*  She put the person up that did it and was like here's a picture and it's blurred out [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2065.4s)]
*  Mmm, and that people were able to dox him and his life got ruined and then came out none of it was true [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2069.0400000000004s)]
*  Yeah, you would look at her and be like that's fucking crazy crazy. Yeah, that's crazy [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2072.88s)]
*  Yeah, so I think it's okay to have this reaction and I think it's not has to take this [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2076.4799999999996s)]
*  And this is the bed you made. Mm-hmm, but I don't think that his career is over should he quit stand-up forever? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2081.2799999999997s)]
*  No, I think you should just go back to doing stand-up like do stand-up where you can [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2086.4799999999996s)]
*  You know more take these liberties with jokes [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2092.2s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like actually reverse what you're doing [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2095.7999999999997s)]
*  You know, I think he's going like here's the tough emotional thing right here [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2098.6s)]
*  And then there's no joke at the end of it like just use these tough emotional things as the joke [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2101.8199999999997s)]
*  You know, they're like your daughter finding this powder in it immediately and you know [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2106.8199999999997s)]
*  You're finding a powder in an envelope, right and you having to like remove your daughter so you could snort it [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2111.58s)]
*  Like whatever that's the joke. It's like she's already into this America's corrupting them blah blah blah not oh my god [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2117.9399999999996s)]
*  There's anthrax the world is so racist and look what's happening to me [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2123.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you know his ex-special could be fire if he goes full [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2126.58s)]
*  Eye if he just opens up like the way Louie opened up with like so how was your year? [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2130.76s)]
*  He's able just to confront it and be really honest about what happened. Yeah, I think you could just bounce back [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2137.5200000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I mean that is the beauty of [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2143.36s)]
*  Stand-up and art it's like a year if you're able to articulate what you were doing [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2146.0400000000004s)]
*  How you did it in an entertaining a fun way people will listen? Yeah people listen Russell on the other hand might have a little bit [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2150.0s)]
*  of a hard [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2156.2000000000003s)]
*  So what do we think with the Russell thing because obviously when we when we asked him come on the pod [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2156.44s)]
*  You know we'd seen this guy come to America and like there was this massive splash when he came. He's so fucking charismatic [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2160.2s)]
*  Really funny charming in person very charismatic of course engaging and then these stories come out [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2168.6s)]
*  So there's four stories there four different girls that are claiming different [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2175.68s)]
*  I don't know versions of [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2181.8799999999997s)]
*  sexual assaults and rape [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2185.3599999999997s)]
*  One girl it's a age thing I think they started dating when she was 16 [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2187.92s)]
*  No, there's an assault with that because the age thing and she was 16 [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2191.82s)]
*  Yeah, and then Russell takes interest they go on dates whatever parents weren't into it [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2195.52s)]
*  She feels like there was grooming involved, but the age of consent in the UK 16 so that in and of itself isn't illegal [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2200.28s)]
*  It's just icky to use your earlier. Yeah, but then she says there was also [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2205.1600000000003s)]
*  assault within the relationship [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2209.4s)]
*  I think he like made her give him head while she was sleeping or something like that like that [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2211.08s)]
*  She was sleeping or something like that like that like she's like punching him to get the story says she's punching him to get her [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2215.16s)]
*  Off he won't do it. He finally does right and then he says according allegedly [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2220.6s)]
*  I just want to see your mascara run away a bit [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2224.16s)]
*  Which the verbiage is also sounds like the way an English dude would say it so you're like well that sounds like familiar [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2226.3999999999996s)]
*  Mourning that's rough also. He wears mascara too, so maybe that's something that he's more familiar with [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2232.3999999999996s)]
*  He just has a greater understanding. I see mascara run away watch your face, bro exactly [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2238.7599999999998s)]
*  Now is it now her parents didn't approve of the relationship is what they races [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2243.48s)]
*  I think they are racist. I think they could I think he showed up at the door [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2249.56s)]
*  Yeah, and then her parents were like I don't think it's a good thing yeah dresses Osama bin Laden again [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2253.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm when he went on a date with her. That's why oh wait. He said we don't want you to meet marrying a Saudi Pakistani [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2258.04s)]
*  I [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2265.56s)]
*  Do this [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2268.92s)]
*  Just the fact that he's brown yeah [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2270.92s)]
*  So here's the thing about it that's obviously tricky is and he brought up something that I thought was quite interesting [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2274.32s)]
*  It's when he was working at channel four. I guess which is like a British channel [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2279.16s)]
*  Mm-hmm, this is a British one of the most channel news channels or whatever [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2284.24s)]
*  I think channel four was one of the [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2288.12s)]
*  Organizations behind this expose and it's like so when I was working for you [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2291.6400000000003s)]
*  You didn't care to do the background check to find out if there was any legitimacy to this you were arguably [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2297.1400000000003s)]
*  Protecting me from some of these allegations and now that I'm not working for you now that I'm [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2303.2400000000002s)]
*  Going against the mainstream media now that I'm pushing back against the narratives that you push all the sudden [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2307.7200000000003s)]
*  You're willing to come forward with this article [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2313.1600000000003s)]
*  Which is I understand also these four women [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2315.5200000000004s)]
*  Only came out when approached by the journalist so they weren't coming out on their own accord [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2319.48s)]
*  No one of them tried to watch you went to the clinic and got the anti rape [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2324.8399999999997s)]
*  Can the rape kid or whatever she got the rape kit, but then she chose not to press charges and pursue it. Yeah, so [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2328.3599999999997s)]
*  It is a tricky situation and women don't pursue these things for many different reasons. Yes, okay. There's embarrassment [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2335.7999999999997s)]
*  There's fear. This is like a failure makes complete sense hundred percent so and he already did something to me [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2341.72s)]
*  That's like a hundred gonna terrify me forever a hundred but [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2347.16s)]
*  Unfortunately, this also does create room for skepticism when the journalist is tracking down the girls and going [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2351.48s)]
*  Hey, didn't he do something to you? These other girls said he did it. Hey, didn't he do something? [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2358.64s)]
*  Hey, didn't he do something and all of a sudden you're trying you you have a specific [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2362.64s)]
*  Motive here the journalist it appears doesn't want to find out that he's innocent [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2367.92s)]
*  Yeah, her article is he's a predator and she's gonna keep asking people until she finds out that he's a predator [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2372.4s)]
*  yeah, now we would hope that they have the journalistic integrity if [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2378.92s)]
*  She didn't find out that they were that she would just go. Okay, we're not gonna we're not gonna post anything [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2383.56s)]
*  I'm not gonna write this article. But again, you don't know and there is that wiggle room right there [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2388.44s)]
*  So this is this is it's tricky man. It's really fucking tricky. Do you think his audience will care? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2394.08s)]
*  Assuming that the charges go through and he's not convicted in a court of law because they're not able to prove it hypothetically [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2399.88s)]
*  I think it stops him from doing anything in like the industry. Mm-hmm for a long time unless he is [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2405.08s)]
*  Exonerated I think he hasn't been given up on the industry though. Yeah, he has yes [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2413.08s)]
*  it might make things tricky like having a big-time promoter for his tour or putting out a special on a [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2417.4s)]
*  On a Netflix or an Amazon or something like that [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2425.1600000000003s)]
*  It might make those things tricky, but he can continue to exist [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2427.52s)]
*  I think online and build his following multiple allegations is always a lot. Yeah. Yeah, that's a lot [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2430.56s)]
*  Yeah [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2436.56s)]
*  Now when he was on on the show you kind of mentioned that he wasn't very Indian and he was using Indian ideas [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2436.84s)]
*  Yeah, this is a thing that one of them. Yeah, do you feel like he's proving his Indians is one of them? [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2443.92s)]
*  Oh, wow, do you believe it? [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2448.48s)]
*  But I like them [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2452.8s)]
*  I [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2455.1200000000003s)]
*  Can you do the [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2456.36s)]
*  No, that's not Hindu dude, that's not Hindu [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2459.48s)]
*  Right, let's fucking let's not conflate these [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2465.52s)]
*  That's fair that's fair [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2470.0800000000004s)]
*  Catholics on the other hand, they don't know nothing about rape. Yeah. No, of course not. Yes. That's your faith, dude [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2473.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, these got American you guys don't know what's going on. Come on. Anyway, the so what are we thinking here? [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2478.86s)]
*  What happens to Russell? Hopefully it's not true. Yes, like in all these cases. Hopefully women weren't are not victimized [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2484.72s)]
*  Yes, but uh, what's crazy is I think he gets bigger. Oh [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2491.2s)]
*  If he's oh if he's accused and then it turns out that it was bullshit [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2496.0s)]
*  Well, I didn't have to turn out of his bullshit like a rape conviction is apparently inviting him realize it so recently really hard [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2502.56s)]
*  It's even hard to get it to trial. So until that happens, it's just gonna be this is bullshit [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2508.2s)]
*  Nothing is happening and I want to make it to trial. It just yeah gets a big yeah. He has a voice to fight it [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2514.36s)]
*  Yes, he does. He's a platform. He is everything. Yeah and a rabid following to [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2519.52s)]
*  so that that is the truth that is the truth though if if he if [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2524.2400000000002s)]
*  If it look if it turns out he is innocent he is without a doubt bigger and not only is he without a bigger [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2528.8s)]
*  He's now a target. He must be doing something crazy. He must be doing something wild [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2534.28s)]
*  He must be really worth filing up the elites. Yes, exactly and he can lean into that 100% [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2539.56s)]
*  And [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2545.88s)]
*  There seems to be enough wiggle room [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2546.96s)]
*  The fact that none of these women came forward the most damning one obviously is the girl who went and got the kit [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2548.7599999999998s)]
*  yeah done and she got a rape kit done and [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2553.92s)]
*  I [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2557.2s)]
*  would assume [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2558.88s)]
*  That there would be DNA from both parties on that. Mm-hmm [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2561.04s)]
*  No, yeah [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2565.04s)]
*  She would still have to prove that it was not consensual and this is gonna be a he said she said situation [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2568.04s)]
*  This is probably why it's important that there are other women involved [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2573.68s)]
*  But at the same time you don't know if there's enough evidence, especially this many years later to prove that mmm [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2576.2799999999997s)]
*  It's a tricky one. Yeah. Yeah, even talk about this shit is tricky like yeah, you want to make jokes, but it's you know [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2582.8s)]
*  Do you know we're kind of the victims in this yeah like we're yeah [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2591.7599999999998s)]
*  We can't even get the jokes off. We want to say so we're being silenced. Yeah, we're being [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2595.08s)]
*  They're fucking silencing us man. I've been trying to make a joke about grape juice for the last [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2600.64s)]
*  Wish you could zoom in all of our heads throughout this whole [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2617.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2625.08s)]
*  Can we just can we just lighten things up dude, yeah, can we yeah, dude. All right, let's go [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2629.4s)]
*  Don't talk about a beautiful wedding. We want to talk about consensual [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2634.92s)]
*  Weddings are the fucking best the best. They're the absolute best [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2639.6s)]
*  everybody get married [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2644.08s)]
*  Get married if you can if you have that opportunity to the right person, you know, even to the wrong person [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2646.08s)]
*  The wedding is probably don't yeah because if it's to the wrong person then it ends you get to run it back [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2653.14s)]
*  The wedding itself is probably don't because you're probably filled up with so much love joy and excitement that you think they are the right person that day [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2659.2599999999998s)]
*  Zing but like weddings are fucking so so we went to Derek postin and Sam postin's wedding and [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2668.66s)]

*  Versus yours and if you feel comfortable sharing, yeah, of course my wedding was just very structured. It's Catholic wedding [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2932.92s)]
*  There was one black person at this wedding. Yeah, actually you were right. No, there was a few there's a few all Derek's family. Yeah [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2937.7200000000003s)]

*  But Catholic wedding is very [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2954.04s)]
*  Very structured very regimental. You don't really do your own vows [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2956.48s)]
*  It's just kind of like a scribe to you then you just have to say what is given and looking back [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2958.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm like man. It would have been fun. Yeah to do some time. Yeah [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2963.24s)]
*  You know the time is good [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2967.8399999999997s)]
*  You know get to work out some bits and it would have been good to actually be vulnerable [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2969.88s)]
*  I feel like watching your boys be gay is awesome [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2973.7999999999997s)]
*  It's a great it's a great thing watching your boys just cry in front of everyone is just the best feeling profess their love [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2976.4s)]
*  Yeah person that you already know they love so much [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2982.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2985.08s)]
*  Hearing that person you might not be as close to talk about how amazing your boy is and how in love with your boy [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2985.3999999999996s)]
*  She is yeah, because obviously we're closer to Derek than we are Sam would love Sam [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2991.52s)]
*  But you know, we don't have we don't go on the road every weekend with her [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2994.8399999999997s)]
*  So hearing how much she loves our boy, we're like, oh hell yeah, you got the one. That's not a great one [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=2997.2799999999997s)]
*  This is gonna be awesome. Yeah, but yeah, it's one of those things that I think that [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3004.04s)]
*  Definitely Derrick's way my way wedding which is probably weren't as traditional in terms of like the religiosity with it because that was in [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3008.6800000000003s)]
*  Some ways removed but at the same time Derek's mom blessed the wedding [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3016.48s)]
*  she had this beautiful speech and like I [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3020.6000000000004s)]
*  Get I guess it it was more about our love and less about like I think sometimes parents get involved [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3023.2000000000003s)]
*  I've been in certain weddings where it's just like this is a wedding for the parents. Yeah, and like or for [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3030.6800000000003s)]
*  God or whatever it is and I think sometimes that can subtract from those moments between [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3037.2s)]
*  the people who love each other, yeah, and [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3043.3999999999996s)]
*  The reason why I'm at weddings now is I need to see that raw unfiltered love [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3046.56s)]
*  Yeah, I need to see two people go at it because they know this is the time [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3050.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you get to say how you feel about that person in front of other people and you better come correct. That's the speech, Molly [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3054.3399999999997s)]
*  That's what you want, bro. You want the verbal Molly? [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3061.3399999999997s)]
*  Oh beautiful it was beautiful. I love it. Yeah [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3063.34s)]
*  I get wedding crashes now. I never understood the concept. That's not where they're crashing. No [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3070.3s)]
*  Through the vows again [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3080.9s)]
*  I need to see more vows, dude. I need to see people renew their vows. Yeah, I like that [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3083.7400000000002s)]
*  That's what I'm gonna do renew your vows. Yeah, I think every five years exactly. That's what we really want [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3088.54s)]
*  Yeah, you know if you celebrate I don't know if y'all the anniversary like party where your friends and family get together [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3093.42s)]
*  You should have to do a speech. Yeah [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3098.1000000000004s)]
*  If everybody's gathering around to celebrate your love you got to tell each other how you feel for real [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3100.5s)]
*  Yeah, I think is a good reminder [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3104.6600000000003s)]
*  I think it's good to show your kids your kids get to go and be like, oh wow our parents really love each other [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3106.2200000000003s)]
*  This is so cool [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3109.98s)]
*  And then you get to invite all your new friends that you've made over the years all to this thing [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3110.56s)]
*  Yeah, and then the other benefit for me is it doesn't have to be necessarily as religious [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3114.1400000000003s)]
*  So like there's no like pressure to do it in a church [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3117.82s)]
*  I could just go to like an awesome venue get a boat somewhere right around [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3120.3s)]
*  Yeah, and then do vows and then party a sick birthday party. Yeah, really? [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3123.46s)]
*  Yeah, it's a birthday for your new life and that's awesome. You guys are one. Yeah, you guys have birthdays [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3127.0600000000004s)]

*  That's your new life. Yeah, you're age zero and then every year is the end to restart the honeymoon period [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3135.5s)]
*  Yeah, because you're reflecting on how much you love that person how much they love you and now you just want to pour into each other [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3139.98s)]
*  Again, yeah, the dollar business we just thought of yeah [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3145.5s)]
*  That's what I'm saying so and then on top of that as your net worth grows you can also do better and better parties [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3147.9799999999996s)]

*  Yeah, yeah [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3661.94s)]

*  Or I don't even know if it's more of a psychological go deep down a wormhole that you were and what was going on [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3683.62s)]
*  What was happening in your head disconnected from mind and body that's really what it is [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3690.06s)]
*  Disassociation full on and then you started playing prevent. Yeah, you were trying to prevent the fuck up [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3694.1400000000003s)]

*  The moment he chooses to be sympathetic in it [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3729.58s)]
*  He's really being nice right? [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3732.2200000000003s)]

*  He's clearly the person who's played the most Alex and him are playing on the same team [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3748.22s)]
*  And it's like match point or something like that and in match point the defending team gets to decide who gets the serve and [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3752.3399999999997s)]
*  Doug was gonna let Alex get the sir tell them that's a lie and blow it for his team [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3759.8999999999996s)]
*  He was gonna let Alex lose the match [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3766.62s)]
*  Oh [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3775.18s)]

*  You're saying I got you out of it. How did I get you out? [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3790.7s)]
*  No, you helped you because you said because you acknowledge that was happening [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3792.7799999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah, if I if because my thought is like, oh, I don't want to ruin it for everyone [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3795.98s)]
*  I'm ruining for you. I'm ruining for my teammate [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3799.98s)]

*  I'm telling you look to me goes. Oh, just keep on thinking about it [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3807.1s)]
*  Yeah, if you want to keep on thinking about you could ruin the whole game [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3809.18s)]
*  Just keep thinking about it and I was like, oh he knows I'm not doing good [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3811.1s)]
*  That means now I have permission to do this and then I hit the ball against the wall. I [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3813.62s)]
*  Faulted essentially or I what is it called? [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3817.74s)]
*  Lost the point. I don't know what the terminology but is right against the wall. Mm-hmm and I [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3821.1s)]
*  Pretended like I was doing that to support him [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3827.7799999999997s)]

*  Yeah, he was just fucking like rubbing off on me [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3833.98s)]
*  It's a weird thing but I feel like I got out of it towards the end. Yeah, you did and we won obviously but uh [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3839.82s)]
*  But it was rough I'm not gonna lie when Alex and I played together [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3846.94s)]
*  Be busted was dominant. It was dominant. Come on. No, we could run that back. I was playing with a broken mark [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3851.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, we can run that back. I PTSD I [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3856.34s)]
*  Had good teamwork, that's what I would chalk it up to [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3860.42s)]
*  I think we have good teamwork and you guys were both trying to jockey for who is gonna, you know score the most [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3862.94s)]
*  Because you played up on us the net and then Alex disappeared and so when he wasn't there that's when you [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3869.34s)]
*  Every every person who played against you targets you because you're the worst on the court [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3878.6600000000003s)]
*  You are the worst [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3884.66s)]
*  Come to your side [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3887.7s)]
*  And then dove hit me with the ball once really close proximity slammed it right in my fucking chest [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=3890.3399999999997s)]

*  No, it was threes I think was three three and then they won't know that's the second year second gate [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4063.6s)]
*  I don't know what's like that. Bye. Anyway, we'll run it back [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4067.7599999999998s)]

*  Yeah, we bagel them [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4077.08s)]
*  Anyway, the point is Dion Sanders is one of these human beings that has existed in history that has an unbelievable [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4077.84s)]
*  Gravitational force. Yes, whenever he does anything. Yes [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4086.36s)]
*  Now obviously he did it with the immense skill when he was playing sports, right? He was a showstopper [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4090.32s)]
*  You had to watch him. He was so exciting [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4094.64s)]
*  I mean the guy was so exciting that you would watch him play defense. That's really rare [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4096.72s)]
*  Yeah, think about that and watch him play defense in a position when the better you are the less you're targeted [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4100.68s)]
*  Yes, that's crazy the entire time at the Cowboys. He never I used to be mad cuz I was young [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4106.5s)]
*  He would never get interceptions and then you got older and like oh, they don't throw it. Yeah, there's a [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4111.02s)]
*  And I still cared. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we're watching him not play. Yeah [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4116.26s)]
*  But it just goes to show he is just one of those individuals that is born in history that has a [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4121.7s)]
*  Gravitational force around him and you just can't keep your eyes off. He is a star [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4128.82s)]
*  He is the hip factor is all those things you speak about with like Hollywood superstars [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4131.66s)]
*  Whatever is that is Deon Sanders and when you match that confidence and bravado with success. Yeah [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4134.94s)]
*  We're all in storm [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4141.86s)]
*  You're talking about like Conor McGregor when he's just blasting through everybody in a lightweight now [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4143.179999999999s)]
*  It's early and they played Colorado State who they should have there were I think the spread is 23 [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4147.82s)]
*  They've been about 20 and they only won by seven with a comeback in overtime [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4152.54s)]
*  I think mm-hmm, but like and they lost one of their key guys [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4155.98s)]
*  Yeah [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4158.9s)]
*  That was it was a cheap shot against Travis Hunter who's along with Deon's son [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4159.339999999999s)]
*  Shadoor is probably the second best player on the team as a chief shot to him. He's a two-way player [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4163.1s)]
*  That's a place both sides. Yeah, so I do think that affected the the way the game turned out [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4167.42s)]
*  But yeah, the guy's fucking unbelievable. I just hope he keeps it going and it'd be awesome to see him keep it going for [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4171.9800000000005s)]
*  You know right now we have no reason to think that he won't but [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4177.740000000001s)]
*  Outside of football. He's just this [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4180.740000000001s)]
*  amazing [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4183.700000000001s)]
*  Human being like anytime he talks you want to listen. Yep. Anytime he's on TV. You want to watch? Yep [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4184.860000000001s)]
*  You want to see him react to things? [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4189.700000000001s)]
*  Everything that he does is interesting in the best way [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4192.099999999999s)]
*  He's like the positive version of a 24-hour [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4195.5s)]
*  Twitch streamer [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4201.22s)]
*  Like it's not car crash car crash car crash. It's motivation motivation motivation. Yeah success success success [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4202.74s)]
*  It is possible to do it. You just need to be that much more talented to do it with positivity and success [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4208.26s)]
*  He's a less divisive Trump kill. Yeah, Trump really divides everyone. It probably divides you a little bit [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4212.9s)]
*  On it bro getting his mom there did you see that no he goes because he did this [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4219.26s)]
*  I don't know if it was poster pre but he does the thing about it [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4224.7s)]
*  They talked about me you could talk the three things you can't talk about you can't talk about me [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4227.42s)]
*  You can't talk about you guys you take can't talk about my mama and he had his mom there with them in the locker room [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4231.0s)]
*  His mom talks. I just told him to be yourself and sometimes you need a kick-ass [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4237.3s)]
*  So get out there and kick-ass and you're just like oh my I'll run through a fucking wall for this guy [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4242.099999999999s)]
*  And this is what's also brilliant is he's always here as a college coach you were always recruiting next year's class you got to recruit [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4247.1s)]
*  Everybody right now wants to go to college. So here's the thing. This is the this is the Elon Musk [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4254.02s)]
*  marketing version of recruiting [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4259.860000000001s)]
*  If Elon is the ambassador the mascot for Tesla, he doesn't need to put an ad in the Super Bowl [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4262.38s)]
*  He doesn't need to put an ad on you know, the NBA games doesn't just spend all this money on marketing [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4268.280000000001s)]
*  He's the marketing. He is the mascot CEO [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4272.240000000001s)]
*  Prime is getting so much attention [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4275.84s)]
*  Yeah on his team if you're an NFL prospect you definitely want the eyeballs. You're gonna get the eye [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4278.92s)]
*  Yeah, I haven't watched a college football game [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4285.6s)]
*  Ever yeah, I did I was in its entirety ever probably I've watched pieces of it when you grow up in New York [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4289.400000000001s)]
*  Balls not popular one and college sports are not popular. That's just so crazy. I know I've watched pieces [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4295.360000000001s)]
*  But like a full start to finish maybe one of the what is it the national championship game or something like that? [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4300.88s)]
*  Because I was at a party but like full no, I'm invested in [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4306.64s)]
*  Colorado awesome. Yeah, I'm invested and that is a function of him [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4311.04s)]
*  So if I'm a young athlete one, I want to play for greatness if you're telling me I'm a young defensive specialist [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4315.2s)]
*  You're saying I'm a young corner coming out of high school [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4320.96s)]
*  You're telling me that I'm going to any other school besides Deon Sanders. Yes [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4323.08s)]
*  There's I can learn from the greatest to do and on top of that now you see what his son is doing at quarterback [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4327.0s)]
*  Whoa, and you're like, bro, I'm a quarterback. He knows how to coach quarterbacks [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4333.08s)]
*  Look what he did with his son [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4337.12s)]
*  So this is what you were saying about like you don't have to advertise and recruit as much as like Nick Saban for Alabama [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4338.2s)]
*  Who's been maybe the probably the greatest college coach ever probably? [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4344.16s)]
*  He doesn't really have to get out there and recruit as much as he did because you know, there's the program recruits [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4347.84s)]
*  Deon did that without a championship [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4352.32s)]
*  he's three games in to being at a good like a like a big-name college and three games in [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4353.96s)]
*  Recruits are watching him bring his mom out next year's recruits for a speech and me like I like that guy [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4359.92s)]
*  I'll play with the flower play for that guy. Now. Here's the question [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4364.04s)]
*  Warren saps already on the coaching staff. Mm-hmm [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4368.0s)]
*  How many other either NFL coaches or ex NFL players? [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4371.36s)]
*  decide [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4376.8s)]
*  You know what? [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4377.76s)]
*  I don't want to deal with these pain in the ass professional athletes make him way more than me telling me to go fuck myself [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4378.56s)]
*  Telling me I can't tell them what to do etc. I would rather take [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4383.76s)]
*  Slightly less money. I mean if you got a real name, maybe it's I again [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4388.0s)]
*  I don't know the pay differential when it comes to assistant coaches, but take less money for [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4392.4800000000005s)]
*  Way less headache way more fun and way more excitement for the players and please believe [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4397.88s)]
*  I'm assuming [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4405.08s)]
*  Colorado if they continue to have this type of success is not only going to generate more revenue for the program [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4406.92s)]
*  But might get more TV revenue if you're getting more marquee games, right? Yeah. Yeah, is that how it works? [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4413.9s)]
*  Yeah, so I think you have a contract and then there's probably bonuses built in but when your contract is up you can renew [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4419.92s)]
*  So he's gonna make Colorado so much money if he stays there for them to rent you can afford to you know [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4425.04s)]
*  Grow the program. Yeah, and what if you get some of these guys? [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4430.66s)]
*  Yeah, dude fuck and if you're at like Chad Ocho Senko, I don't know if he has any interest in coaching [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4433.9400000000005s)]
*  But he's so charismatic recruiting not even a fucking question [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4439.54s)]
*  Are you gonna go to me or Jimbo Fisher at A&M? [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4443.9s)]
*  I'm not fucking think about that like playing for your heroes [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4447.14s)]
*  Yeah, that's fine. That's fine [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4450.78s)]
*  The only thing I'm a little bit worried is that so Dion does a great job in terms of balancing [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4453.9800000000005s)]
*  Confidence and motivation [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4461.64s)]
*  but the players I'm starting to see are kind of just like a whole lot of confidence and [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4463.64s)]
*  if that team [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4469.64s)]
*  With all the eyes on it. I think they might turn heel where people are gonna be like, yeah [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4472.4800000000005s)]
*  This is yeah to company I talking too much and now they're just going stuff. We'll see them loose [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4478.0s)]
*  you know what I think, you know, I think will will happen is [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4483.4400000000005s)]
*  As [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4486.36s)]
*  Connor was a face as long as he was winning [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4488.4s)]
*  Everybody was rocking for him [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4493.599999999999s)]
*  You want to continue to watch Connor when he was knocking people out in tremendous fashions justified [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4494.96s)]
*  Just the arrogance was justified the confidence was justified and we'd like to follow [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4500.599999999999s)]
*  That leader in that regard like his human beings but the second the arrogant confident person loses [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4506.719999999999s)]
*  We love to pile on yeah, so I think that what you're describing might happen with casuals after a loss [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4514.04s)]
*  Hmm, but if they continue to win the way that they're winning and get grants [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4520.68s)]
*  It was a close game against a team that they should have maybe blown out [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4525.56s)]
*  But if they continue I don't see any reason why people will resent them to make a weather [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4528.320000000001s)]
*  But but here's the thing with my kept winning and then it got to a point people just wanted to see him loose [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4534.0s)]
*  But Mayweather won in a way that people didn't want to see [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4538.240000000001s)]
*  If if when Mike Tyson was knocking people out, yeah, we loved loved [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4543.28s)]
*  so I [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4549.32s)]

*  I think it was also a close game, but they were good and you beat them and nobody saw that coming [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4561.08s)]
*  We're gonna love it this weekend. The schedule is gonna this week. You know, it is talk to us [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4565.44s)]

*  So that's when you need the Travis Hunter Quebec and you didn't playing on both sides of the he's out for weeks. I think [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4586.4400000000005s)]

*  227.5 passing yards against the Cardinals. I think the Cardinals are really bad [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4625.64s)]
*  I think Dak will have more than that done and then miles Sanders the running back for the Carolina Panthers [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4628.88s)]
*  They say 12.5 receiving yards. I think that's easy enough to beat. I think that's just something you got to go with [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4634.08s)]

*  You want to put in now? Let's get back to the show boys [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4673.72s)]
*  We have to talk about very important cultural phenomenons right now [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4676.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah, Halle Berry is absolutely furious that Drake used her picture of her getting slimed for [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4679.0199999999995s)]
*  The cover of his song. I believe it's a single. It's not for the album [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4686.44s)]
*  also [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4692.32s)]
*  side notes [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4693.4s)]
*  Phenomenal rollout to this album [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4695.88s)]
*  He has held the conversation about the album coming out [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4697.8s)]
*  For how long months months at least a month or a month and a half [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4702.8s)]
*  yeah, he's just controlled the conversation and I'm like as [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4707.68s)]
*  Long as you can milk it [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4713.28s)]
*  You milk it because you can always drop the album and then all those people that were excited are gonna go listen [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4715.24s)]
*  They're gonna listen once the album drops. We know that for a fact [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4721.5199999999995s)]
*  So it's how long can you get people listening or no talking about it helping you promote it? [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4723.68s)]
*  Speaking it to their friends without you actually dropping a month and a half is fantastic [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4730.58s)]
*  Yeah, fantastic and also having like the IQ or the EQ to know what the energy is. Yeah [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4735.18s)]
*  Okay, let's drop something oh, it's good [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4742.18s)]
*  Let's close for a little bit. Yeah, and then when the album eventually drops, it'll be the right time [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4744.86s)]
*  Yeah, not being so locked into an exact date. So what makes the right time? [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4748.26s)]
*  Does it have to be the peak of the people talking about it? I don't think it does [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4752.0s)]
*  Not they calculate a few things like who else is dropping that weekend [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4756.34s)]
*  the if all the clearances for the samples [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4761.46s)]
*  Yeah, that usually pushes things back a lot got it yeah [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4767.14s)]
*  Cuz he he said somewhere he's like I could either stop doing some shows and finish this album or we could push the album back [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4769.92s)]
*  And I don't want to cancel the show. Yeah, so who's gonna want you to cancel exactly. Yeah [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4775.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's just really if this is a really interesting rollout to control the conversation for a month and a half [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4781.3s)]
*  Yeah, so it's hard to hold energy for a week [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4787.7s)]
*  Mm-hmm. He's Drake bro. He's right [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4792.18s)]
*  Not really really well done. Okay, but what we're really talking about this is Halle Berry thing [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4795.54s)]
*  Is she really mad she fake mad should she be bad? Didn't he ask her and she said no [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4799.900000000001s)]
*  No, she's saying he never asked her permission. Oh, okay. That's it. Yeah, I'm like you should be bad [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4804.62s)]
*  Say she should be mad [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4810.34s)]
*  But does she own the picture that's the thing [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4813.34s)]
*  I don't even know if it's up to her to get the permission unless he smashed it kind of makes me feel he's [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4815.08s)]
*  Because otherwise, why would he call her? Does he have your number? You guys talking? Is there a personal connection? [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4820.1s)]
*  He's Drake you can get in contact with anyone if he needs it. No, I'm saying I don't think Halle's at the level where [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4824.88s)]
*  Talk to her like that [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4830.9400000000005s)]
*  I mean, she's a legend. Yeah, yeah, she's a legend, but that's more like [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4833.58s)]
*  You know [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4837.26s)]
*  That's the icon this is the icon maybe get slimed up slimed out that take is count fire [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4843.5s)]
*  Back to [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4850.9400000000005s)]
*  No, I was a Mexican alien come right there [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4854.780000000001s)]
*  That's why she's upset [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4858.1s)]
*  Yeah [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4860.5s)]
*  What yeah, we got talk about that Mexican aliens, but but yeah, so what's the thing? [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4861.700000000001s)]
*  I mean, this is just great for him more controversy more people talking about it more things [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4865.54s)]
*  And of course, he's not gonna ask you call for all the dogs. He's being a dog [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4869.700000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah, also her criticism was not that bad is like man for someone I respect. I wish you asked [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4873.26s)]
*  Yeah, it's a very like but also if she says anything it's news. He's picking it up. It's more marketing [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4878.42s)]
*  It's almost like Halle. He can't ask [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4884.3s)]
*  He can't ask because by not asking you'll talk about it and then create news [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4887.34s)]
*  If he puts it out and you yeah, you asked me [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4892.38s)]
*  He was so sweet and polite and kind and he offered me royalties and it was just he's just the best person [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4895.42s)]
*  No, no new story at all. Yeah, I think didn't Kanye kind of do that with the [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4899.7s)]
*  Famous the music video with it had all the people [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4904.54s)]
*  Yeah, and like it just if you're in the video it's like what's your comment? [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4909.18s)]
*  What do you have to say about you being in this very famous video everyone commented either they comment or they don't comment [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4912.78s)]
*  And then oh, what does it not comment me? What's going on? [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4918.42s)]
*  it's just like create you're just pulling people into your orbit and drank did this with the [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4920.86s)]
*  21 album rollout when he did the fake Vogue cover and then Vogue was really upset about that [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4925.58s)]
*  And then they sued him and so that was a whole big story. Yeah around the album [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4930.82s)]
*  So that's fantastic. It's just big enough now that pulling people into his orbit is a lot easier. Yeah [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4935.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, but yes, I'm gonna think about man the rollout it's really impressive that's amazing [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4939.820000000001s)]
*  Yes, it's really really impressive. I wonder if other artists try to create something similar [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4946.14s)]
*  Also, it helps that he's already touring. This is another thing that thought was interesting [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4951.22s)]
*  I figured you drop the album a few months before you go tour and then you tour that album plus your old stuff [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4955.42s)]
*  but [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4963.18s)]
*  he [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4964.900000000001s)]
*  Starts the tour and teases the album during the tour now you're teasing the album [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4966.18s)]
*  During peak conversation about you already because you're touring [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4971.18s)]
*  so [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4976.06s)]
*  You're not even worried about touring this album just yet, and I wonder if that's because [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4977.18s)]
*  You'll never tour an album again [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4983.5s)]
*  When people go see a Drake show they need to see this they need to see all the things [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4986.14s)]
*  Yeah, you ain't gonna just tour your little album. Yeah, you won't play the hits [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4991.46s)]
*  Yeah, so if he's going maybe he's going well if I gotta play the hits no matter what it don't matter when I drop [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=4995.42s)]
*  Yeah, and if there's bangers on this one, they want to see it on the next tour and if there ain't [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5001.46s)]
*  People are less inclined to buy tickets for the tour because they're like, oh, I didn't like this album is he touring this album? [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5006.82s)]
*  Mm-hmm. I didn't even know musicians just toward albums like that [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5012.18s)]
*  I thought they were always playing hits because there's so much [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5015.74s)]
*  Replay value for fans what they usually would do back in the day would do is tour the majority of the new album [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5018.02s)]
*  Plus a couple bangers, but it would be the okay [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5024.54s)]
*  Yeah, now I think it's flopped. They're like flip-flops [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5028.9400000000005s)]
*  So it's like now it's majority of that catalog a couple from the new journey and but I think I would make or everyone [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5031.8s)]
*  Everyone pretty like for like for example Beyonce is doing the old songs that are the super smash hits [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5037.700000000001s)]
*  But she is doing the majority of this new album and that was Taylor from brilliant idiots. She was bothered by that [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5043.0s)]
*  She's like I kind of wanted more of the hits [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5049.34s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't want all this out because you might not fall in love with this album just yet [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5052.14s)]
*  Yeah, it takes time to fall in love with an album a lot of times and it might just not be your best album [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5056.14s)]
*  Yeah, so what protects the tour is knowing that they're gonna go see the whole show just a Drake show [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5060.9400000000005s)]
*  You're coming to see Drake and forever [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5065.76s)]
*  It will be Drake and I think it would be a mistake if you drop an album while on tour because the tour [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5067.64s)]
*  Set track everything is like planned out and to change something this late in the game [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5074.14s)]
*  What happens if one saw super slaps? Oh wow, so what you're saying, which I think is is genius [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5079.86s)]
*  What you're saying is is that he was never gonna put the album out in the first place correct 100% [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5085.96s)]
*  I think so. Oh, and that makes perfect sense. Of course [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5091.82s)]
*  Why would you put the album out there if it succeeds it throws off your track list? [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5094.4s)]
*  Mm-hmm [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5099.0599999999995s)]
*  If it fails now people are talking about the album that isn't that good that could tarnish the excitement of the tour [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5099.58s)]
*  Use the excitement of the tour [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5105.78s)]
*  To build the hype for the album that you drop the second after the tour is done [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5108.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think the album drops during the tour. I do I think that he kind of confirmed that it can't yeah [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5113.5s)]
*  he said he'll have to miss some dates or [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5119.3s)]
*  Finish the tour and then the other so he basically just told you that was not good now [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5122.900000000001s)]
*  Here's the question. Does he because I think right now he's only toured [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5126.780000000001s)]
*  America and North America [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5131.580000000001s)]
*  I [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5134.22s)]
*  Believe so yeah, I don't think he did international [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5135.78s)]
*  So he's gonna do that. Yeah, that's true might not [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5139.22s)]
*  He might not not everybody tours [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5144.82s)]
*  internationally every single [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5148.3s)]
*  Yeah, it seems crazy to pass up that money. Yes. It feels like he is there's just so much money to be made from it. I mean [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5150.42s)]
*  Or he could remix it a little bit once the new album drops or then now add some of the new songs [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5157.18s)]
*  Give it, you know, and then now he almost created a reason for people to go see [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5162.9s)]
*  Him internationally. Yeah, like American fans even back. Y'all I'm flying to blah blah blah to go check them [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5168.7s)]
*  Because he's gonna do yes, you know songs from the new album. Yeah, and I bet you on the new album. He'll probably have a few [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5174.9s)]
*  UK [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5181.1s)]
*  European African artists. So now when he does the international tour now, they're all popping into those shows and [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5182.34s)]
*  Creating more excitement. So that's why you have this shit with central central see that just dropped. Hmm, that's buzzing right now [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5188.78s)]
*  So when he do it goes to London and they do that on the radar shit that shit is gonna go off [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5195.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, also his dates only go to October 7th. So yeah, I'll probably wait [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5200.86s)]
*  Cuz right now he said that he's dropping when October 6th [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5206.0599999999995s)]
*  Or he might line it up with the OVO shit, which then that would be the crazy that makes even more sense [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5210.74s)]
*  Yeah, like OVO fest is in October, right? Mm-hmm [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5215.22s)]
*  So of course you're gonna drop it around then and then you do the big festival in Toronto [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5218.58s)]
*  And then you play some of it at the festival like all this makes perfect [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5223.02s)]
*  That's what I was saying dropping in September actually seems so crazy. You have to drop in October OVO [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5226.62s)]
*  You have to that's by design. That's genius. Yeah, that's class genius [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5230.58s)]
*  Yeah, now everybody's talking about it for months before it comes out by the time it finally comes out. You're so fucking hyped. Mm-hmm [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5234.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I bet you there'll be a lot of international artists on itself on this out [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5241.34s)]
*  Yeah, the one coming up like burn a boy. Yeah, like that'd be five [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5245.780000000001s)]

*  Here's something. I don't understand. This story is going out that America lost an f-35 [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5423.82s)]
*  Okay, so f-35 were these like crazy jets in America [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5429.36s)]
*  Spent all this money developing and then did Tom Cruise fly one in Maverick. No, okay [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5433.299999999999s)]
*  Don't know it but basically [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5438.38s)]
*  They would have flown the f-35 in Maverick, but they have to fly with somebody else. So they had to use a [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5441.259999999999s)]
*  Two-person so it's that okay. I got it. I think the f-35 is a single seat [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5448.0199999999995s)]
*  But the f-35 can like take off from a sitting position. Oh, that's far off the aircraft carrier. I believe yeah aircraft [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5452.5s)]
*  Yeah, so it's a fifth generation fighter or whatever and what does that mean? [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5460.94s)]
*  It's just like his parents parents were born here [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5465.82s)]
*  There's four other generations of fighters before it, okay, so [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5470.14s)]
*  What are we up to now? [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5475.14s)]
*  Fifth oh, yeah, maybe they've developed a sixth one. But right now I've had four before there's an each [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5477.34s)]
*  They had a new one a new one a new there's the fifth new one [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5481.7s)]
*  We could be wrong about this, but I think that's pretty self-explanatory [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5483.7s)]
*  The fifth generation fighter how many generations were there well at least 12? [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5488.26s)]
*  Yeah [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5491.68s)]
*  Negatives yeah [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5493.68s)]
*  No, yeah [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5494.68s)]
*  So basically what happens I have some people said that this this plane was kind of a [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5495.200000000001s)]
*  Like a dud like they spent all this money developing it that didn't exactly work out the way they wanted now that could also be [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5499.200000000001s)]
*  Propaganda from us. Yeah, like maybe they want to convince other countries. Yeah, they have 35 [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5505.4800000000005s)]
*  You know, they spent all this money and it was really a bomb and they don't really work that well [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5510.12s)]
*  They're not that great fighter. So you don't know nothing to worry about so you never know, right? [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5513.6s)]
*  But some people say it was kind of a dud now [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5516.6s)]
*  Somehow a pilot was flying it ejected and then the plane is just continuing to fly and for some reason they've shared this [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5519.72s)]
*  Information with us but for some reason the government is saying hey help us locate this aircraft if you can what are you doing? [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5527.32s)]
*  What I don't understand is one [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5534.36s)]
*  How is there no GPS on it there has to be because if there was another plane that was flying in our territory [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5536.08s)]
*  We would know if it was there we'd be tracking at the whole fucking time [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5541.14s)]
*  So it makes no sense and two it's embarrassing to acknowledge that you've lost your plane [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5543.76s)]
*  Yes, why would you even promote it? It's just this story to me is so odd. It makes no sense [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5548.12s)]
*  Do they have to tell the FAA? [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5554.28s)]
*  If there's a plane flying around airspace, bro [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5556.4s)]
*  They didn't have to tell him that they fake the fucking [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5558.62s)]
*  Golvatonkin shit like like we've been faking army stuff all the fucking time. It's been false flags every fucking ten years [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5561.84s)]
*  So it's like just don't tell anybody about what if there's a plane flying around airspace? [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5567.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, what if it did it's another commercial play they have to tell the FAA like hey just so you guys know [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5572.12s)]
*  There's a plane flying around it [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5576.88s)]
*  Apparently it's a stealth fighter and that's why it's hard to find [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5578.8s)]
*  Mean and hey, at least you know, the fifth generation is good. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I guess I just seem so odd [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5581.96s)]
*  Okay, maybe they tell the FAA and then the FAA is just sends out a message everybody [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5588.16s)]
*  You don't think Biden or somebody can call and just be like, you know quiet [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5591.76s)]
*  Wait do what? I can call the FAA and be like, you know, keep it quiet Mark just checked out [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5596.16s)]
*  I know he did [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5601.4s)]
*  I was like to keep a watch that was crazy [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5603.4s)]
*  Okay, so yeah, I just don't get it like why would this story be promoted just seems so weird [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5609.08s)]
*  You guys don't care about its own optics anymore. It feels it's just like whatever [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5614.679999999999s)]
*  Well, it's almost like they're like, you don't gotta be perfect, which I don't like. Yeah, I want us to care about our optics [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5618.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't like this. So at this time of recording, it's still flying. I [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5624.639999999999s)]
*  Haven't heard that they found it. Yeah, nothing but eventually it's gonna run out of fuel [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5629.200000000001s)]
*  so there's a there's a version of this and we're just kind of like, you know hypothesizing right now, but there's a version where like [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5633.84s)]
*  Maybe it has some sort of [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5639.68s)]
*  Homing mechanism or homing beacon where it can return home and the way that a drone does [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5642.12s)]
*  You know when a drone is running low on battery just automatically autopilot pilot takes it back [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5648.08s)]
*  Maybe it has registered that there's been an ejection and now it goes. Okay, it's my job to go land myself [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5653.160000000001s)]
*  And so maybe it's going to land itself somewhere. But if it is gonna do that, just let it fucking land itself [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5659.12s)]
*  Also, nobody's hiding an f-35 [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5664.84s)]
*  You know, I mean if it lands on American soil, nobody's gonna be like, you know, don't tell the government [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5667.6s)]
*  We got an f-35 you can't use it at 35. No, if you find a f-35 you would keep it [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5672.08s)]
*  Yeah, I would keep it but I don't know how to use it but you'd use it for something [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5676.0s)]
*  Also, you know why I wouldn't keep it what because promo I would assume that they would under that that the government would have a GPS on [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5680.4400000000005s)]
*  This shit so I'd be like, oh they don't come collected immediately. There's no way I think I could sneak in f-35 [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5687.76s)]
*  No, I just take the air tag out. You'd be good. Yeah [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5692.320000000001s)]
*  So, yeah, I'm just like it's just such a thing. Yeah, it's a little weird such an odd thing [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5697.4800000000005s)]
*  They said for some unknown reason they the GPS isn't working [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5702.3s)]
*  Reason the GPS isn't working [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5707.92s)]
*  I think they have to tell people just in case this shit crashes into some place. My is my guess [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5710.08s)]
*  Another country hacked our f-35 the pilot realized he didn't have control and [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5715.900000000001s)]
*  He calls to the base the base goes we don't have control. He's like fuck somebody else has hacked our shit [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5720.62s)]
*  I'm ejecting he manually ejects right now [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5726.66s)]
*  The plane can go wherever the cut whatever country hijacked or alien hijacked it, right? [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5729.96s)]
*  We have to save face and say [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5735.54s)]
*  Because we don't want to start an all-out war because China hacked our shit. So we gotta go. Hey, there's been a malfunction [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5739.22s)]
*  We're looking for an f-35 if you see it by the way, just let us know or if you see one flying around [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5744.7s)]
*  Erratically, just let you know we've had some issues pilot tripped. He's no longer [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5748.86s)]
*  Fell out but he's gonna be just okay [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5753.74s)]
*  I think it might be one of those situations where in order to save face we have to do this very embarrassing thing [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5755.7s)]
*  But it is less embarrassing than admitting that Russia North Korea China India whoever [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5760.98s)]
*  Hijacked I'm like through the last one. Yeah [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5768.62s)]
*  Now break break [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5771.099999999999s)]
*  Learn about it. What else we got boys basically hunter Biden is a they're trying to wrap up with some gun charges [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5773.58s)]
*  Yeah, so dumb. Isn't it funny the Republicans suddenly won gun control [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5779.7s)]
*  No, you can't just let anybody buy a gun [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5785.94s)]
*  Can you explain what the problem is? I don't know anything about this [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5788.38s)]
*  So they said he lied about being addicted to cocaine and bought a purchased a firearm and you're not supposed to admit to this [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5790.5s)]
*  Thing I guess everyone lies about being addicted to cocaine. That's not fair [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5797.74s)]
*  Right. Have you ever asked someone that likes cocaine like you're addicted? [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5800.82s)]
*  Yeah, I bet 90% of people who own guns have done cocaine and actively do [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5803.58s)]
*  100 like nobody's gonna go. Yeah, I'm doing cocaine or I do crack [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5808.54s)]
*  I'm he was addicted to crack at the time and is illegal blah blah blah [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5812.179999999999s)]
*  But also yeah, you don't have to say you're addicted. You just like it. I'm not addicted to Padel [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5814.82s)]
*  But I do it like hunter does crack [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5821.099999999999s)]
*  Whenever he can yeah [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5823.82s)]
*  So, yeah [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5825.58s)]
*  Honestly, it's a it's a law that should be in place. You should have some laws that say hey if you're a drug addict [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5827.26s)]
*  You should be able to buy a gun [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5832.58s)]
*  But I have a hard time believing that drug addicts that want guns are going to be honest [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5833.82s)]
*  Yeah, and I also have a hard time believing Republicans really give a fuck. That's a background [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5838.38s)]
*  You want a background check now? They just can't pin any of the Ukraine shit on them [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5842.42s)]
*  Which is what you really should get it for. Yeah. Yeah, they went through billions of dollars of guns and they're like, alright [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5845.98s)]
*  Well, we have one that I think we can get on [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5850.86s)]
*  This is like when you get the gang on racketeering yeah, like you can't get them on the drugs or the murder [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5853.54s)]
*  Yeah, you got Al Capone on tax evade. Yes, exactly. I think Joe Biden to appear tough on crime [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5858.759999999999s)]
*  He should sacrifice his son and be like, yo throw the book at him lock him up. And then once he gets reelected [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5864.28s)]
*  I'm pardoning you [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5870.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's a winning move, right? [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5871.9s)]
*  Everybody would respect. Yeah, this guy's about it dude. It is hard to vote for a guy though if his son is in prison [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5876.219999999999s)]
*  But he would mean like you put him it's clear that he should be in prison [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5881.58s)]
*  Yeah, I think he definitely gets the minority vote [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5886.7s)]
*  I think like minority parents like are like, you know discipline the fuck out of your kids [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5894.58s)]
*  Oh, yeah, we're like white parenting. It's like well [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5898.3s)]
*  Let's just not have grades in school and let's just be a little bit more open-minded and understand all the time out [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5900.54s)]
*  Your bit where you said white parents like if you love flowers be a flower [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5907.5s)]
*  Like so I think it's I think this is a little [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5913.62s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know that might work. I mean the hunter thing is just I how is this not even bigger the president's son is a crackhead [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5917.26s)]
*  How is that not the biggest story every single day of the week [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5925.38s)]
*  I mean they've been they talk about a quiet a bit, but like this stick nobody can if Trump's son was a known crackhead [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5928.66s)]
*  It would be non fucking stop [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5935.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh, and I bet one American News or whatever they're talking about this shit all the time to be fair [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5937.82s)]
*  But well the thing that annoys I think a lot of Republicans and moderates is mainstream media [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5942.66s)]
*  Meaning the channels we go to for news on TV tends to lean liberal. Do you know it just does [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5948.62s)]
*  Do you know what else I think it is? I think that [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5953.62s)]
*  There are so many kids with drug problems [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5956.22s)]
*  That it's not novel. It's weirdly related [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5960.38s)]
*  Maybe this is the most relatable thing about him. Yeah, I think that it's indicative like a real problem in America, which is like [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5964.42s)]
*  People are addicted to fucking trucks [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5970.54s)]
*  So it's like if it's not your kids your friends kids were your friends kids went to rehab or these types of things [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5972.02s)]
*  It's like so normalized that maybe they even had empathy [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5977.46s)]
*  Because all these parents thought that they were good parents and their kid got addicted to drugs [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5980.66s)]
*  So it's like oh, maybe I wasn't a bad guy [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5984.5s)]
*  And this is so tragic that his son got involved in shit just like my nephew were just like my niece like [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5986.46s)]
*  There's no way all of us don't have within one degree of separation somebody who is addicted to drugs mm-hmm right mm-hmm like [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5991.38s)]
*  Fuck man, maybe that's it [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=5999.820000000001s)]
*  Maybe that's it like this the whole opioid crisis like all these things that are going down. It's just the most relatable fucking thing. Mm-hmm [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6002.66s)]
*  Yeah, and that's why I'm like I don't know if he should be in jail [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6010.02s)]
*  I mean you said like he obviously should be in prison was like I don't know if he should be in prison [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6012.66s)]
*  I mean by the letter of the law he probably breaks the law every time he buys crack cocaine [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6016.22s)]
*  Yeah, I'm like prison but prison for the Ukraine shit. Yeah like that. Yeah, of course [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6020.14s)]
*  I mean he's done a lot of shit. Yeah, and also like it's not even him that should be in prison [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6026.06s)]
*  It's like it's really probably [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6030.9400000000005s)]
*  Joe and like the people around Joe who have [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6033.14s)]
*  Bent the law so they could profit off of their positions of power and they basically place [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6037.1s)]
*  Him in there as this person who can collect money and bribes etc. You can have influence on the government [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6042.54s)]
*  Systemic thing. Yeah, exactly. So it's like it's not even his fault and obviously he doesn't have a job or a passion [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6048.0199999999995s)]
*  Bees he's a drug addict. So yeah, we can place him in there to collect all the money [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6053.299999999999s)]
*  I think to be fair that's what they're trying to impeach by in fours. Yeah. Yeah, they beat him for that [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6057.259999999999s)]
*  I don't know. So every this is I mean, you know, I'm not slippery slope [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6062.179999999999s)]
*  That's not slippery slope for us. But for them y'all and start impeaching because of inappropriate money [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6065.0199999999995s)]
*  We would love that but y'all [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6069.66s)]
*  It's like it's like locking up rich people for not paying the same amount for a tax evasion [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6072.5s)]
*  Yeah, and it's just like well they created the tax code. They're not evading taxes [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6076.7s)]
*  They just found a way where they don't really have to pay that much before the law is written. They figured it out [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6080.22s)]
*  Yeah, and where they write the laws and the same thing goes with the president [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6084.139999999999s)]
*  It's like he's not the first president to profit off of it [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6087.42s)]
*  I mean when fucking Hillary Clinton was in the State Department [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6089.9s)]
*  The Clinton Foundation was getting these donations to the tune of like tens of millions of dollars in the second [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6091.78s)]
*  She's out of the State Department 90% of the funding washed up. Why do we think that is? Yeah, right [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6097.66s)]
*  We need some influence and if you're another country you should be paying for that influence [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6103.74s)]
*  How do I get in the room with Barack? How do I get in? Oh, how do I get in the room with the? [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6107.7s)]
*  But who is she she was under Barack, right? Yeah, how do I get in the room with Barack? [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6112.66s)]
*  Oh, well if I have some influence over that lady who's you know, the what is it the [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6115.98s)]
*  What is the name of the position the secretary of? [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6121.78s)]
*  State the Secretary of State so it's like real real state planning real like what is America gonna do the world? [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6126.26s)]
*  Yeah, I'd like to have some of those over there [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6131.98s)]
*  So I'll give her husband her husband and their fucking foundation 50 million dollars [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6133.62s)]
*  That's one way if you're gonna peach Biden for that you should impeach everyone every president's ever exist [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6137.78s)]
*  That's one way. It's just a systemic thing. They're all doing it. Yeah, so I'm down to do this [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6142.94s)]
*  But we better go after everyone don't just make it Biden go after every one of these corrupt motherfuckers [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6148.139999999999s)]
*  But unfortunately the popularity contest that is, you know, who's gonna be the president United States of America [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6152.5s)]
*  You know it behooves the other side to make the other person not popular. Yeah, so they're not even doing this to win [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6156.5s)]
*  They're just doing this to make him not win the election. Yeah. Mm-hmm [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6161.5s)]
*  yeah, so you're right systemic and it's a problem and it's fucking annoying and [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6164.46s)]
*  Yeah, how else but how else do you choose somebody? [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6169.5s)]
*  If it's not a popularity contrast, how else do you choose somebody? [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6172.3s)]
*  The issue with Biden or with Hunter is that all the shit he did is kind of awesome [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6174.82s)]
*  Getting your dick sock while pointing a gun at the camera. Yeah, it's like the Trump thing where it's like [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6178.62s)]
*  Yeah, you don't really agree with what he said, but the way he said it was yeah [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6183.06s)]
*  I feel like Hunter should be Trump's son, doesn't it? Yeah, that's the pair that we that's the pair [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6185.78s)]
*  That should be the best the reality show American needs if Trump runs with hunter Biden as a VP rock game over [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6190.92s)]
*  Yeah, everyone everyone game over dude. Yeah, that's what we're missing [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6197.24s)]
*  Yes, it's quite interesting Trump's kids are so put together [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6201.88s)]
*  Yeah, like his daughter [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6206.08s)]
*  Ivanka is like [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6209.24s)]
*  Brilliant beautiful [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6214.56s)]
*  Successful you don't hear that much about you don't hear anything about any of that's the other daughter that might be like [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6216.56s)]
*  And we're talking not even like the black sheep. We're saying like, oh, maybe she's more into party [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6223.4400000000005s)]
*  or maybe she's not as successful as the other ones, but the kids have all done really well and [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6228.0s)]
*  Say what you want say what you want the kids turned out good. Hey [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6233.8s)]
*  I don't know what to tell you [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6241.76s)]
*  Do you have control those things maybe you don't maybe you just look at the luck of the draw they just got lucky maybe great moms [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6244.04s)]
*  I don't know. This is a real small place to take it [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6250.92s)]
*  But if you don't a comedy show and the show is good, you're always like the host gets credit if it's bad [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6254.46s)]
*  You're like, yeah, that's on the host. I feel that way about parenting a little bit dude. I've never [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6257.92s)]
*  Blamed the host. Yeah, I've never heard that [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6262.280000000001s)]
*  I hosted a lot so the show is bad. I was like that's on me. No [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6265.08s)]
*  Really yeah, I mean I don't it's yeah, I'm not gonna take it home and want to fucking [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6269.3s)]
*  Mom, I'm like, oh, I gotta eat that that's gotta be on me. I always acknowledge. It was the most difficult spot. Yeah, but [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6274.54s)]
*  The whole show being bad because the hosts no like by the time the headliner gets on they should forget that the host was ever [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6283.36s)]
*  On stage. Oh, I'm thinking like 15 minutes spots at close like a feature club show. We're all doing for the ad [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6289.74s)]
*  I [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6295.82s)]
*  Never I never put that responsibility on them. I've seen host bomb and I've been like, oh dude, that's a tough spot [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6298.66s)]
*  The crowds not connected. They're not there and it is a fucking hard thing [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6304.54s)]
*  But I so you're saying like if the kids are successful goes for the parents. You gotta get kids are not successful. She got eat that [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6308.66s)]
*  What a Biden's kids was a war hero, I mean that kid seems successful that's a good counterpoint to my ill-thought-of [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6317.299999999999s)]
*  Kids are just so different, you know, like we're all so different. Yeah, what works for one kid my not work [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6325.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, like it's just and being able to transition that parenting ability [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6330.379999999999s)]
*  I guess is part of it but like kids are just born and they have their own unique personalities and [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6334.259999999999s)]
*  There's only so much you could do. That's just so weird. Yeah, just like see a little kid having personality [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6339.9s)]
*  What the fuck what is going on? Yeah, they might be nothing like their parents [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6345.099999999999s)]
*  They might be exactly like their parents thinking of things. Yeah interests. Yeah. Yeah, it's really crazy [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6348.9s)]
*  So yeah, that's what I'm like, I don't know how much you can blame it like people are trying to put it on Biden [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6354.0599999999995s)]
*  Like yo, you can't even raise your kid. I'm like, ah, I don't know if that's super fair [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6357.82s)]
*  Also think do the drug addicts. I'm like, yeah, that sucks. Yeah, I feel bad for drug [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6361.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's yeah, I'm sure he doesn't want his kid to be a drug [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6366.98s)]
*  I think the assumption is always these people who like desire power that the only thing that they've ever cared about is that power and [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6370.179999999999s)]
*  Because of that they failed their family [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6377.54s)]
*  And I think that's maybe where people go oh, this is your fault, you know Joe Biden if maybe you care more about your family [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6379.86s)]
*  This wouldn't have happened [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6385.98s)]
*  But who fucking knows if that's true, I mean Trump has clearly wanted power and success [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6388.9s)]
*  And then he has all these kids that are fucking incredibly successful [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6393.06s)]
*  So America's have a crow call that way though, because if you'd know kids, they're like, yeah, you should have a family [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6395.88s)]
*  Yeah, and if you do have kids, they're like, you know [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6400.18s)]
*  Fucking yeah, it's like running the country's not like a nine-to-five [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6403.98s)]
*  Go home and play catch every day. Yeah [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6407.62s)]
*  Yeah, it is true. We do want everything but then then would you make the argument that we should scrutinize the most powerful position in the world? [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6410.58s)]
*  Yeah, we should we know we should put you through the rain. It's like imagine what we do when we hire [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6418.099999999999s)]
*  You know a lawyer what you do when you hire [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6423.42s)]
*  Or just anybody who works for you like you're gonna put them through the ringer [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6427.26s)]
*  You're gonna make sure that they're fucking qualified [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6430.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6432.5s)]
*  I guess his point is just I don't want you to have a wife and kids because I don't want anything taken away from your time [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6432.7s)]
*  Yeah, or husband and kids. Well, we want you to have a wife and kids and we want them to be perfect without you doing anything [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6437.46s)]
*  Yeah, you're fully dedicated. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6442.38s)]
*  Also, I don't know how much like being a good parent has to do with being the president like it kind of does in your [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6446.099999999999s)]
*  Heart, but does it actually though? No, like if you're if you're in a pinch, you know a lawyer and you're like [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6450.62s)]
*  Oh, this guy's a terrible day cheats on his wife, but he's the greatest lawyer. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I don't give a shit, right [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6455.74s)]
*  Like no one cares. Yeah, but if they're good at their job, like no one cares what they're doing [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6460.94s)]
*  Oh, yeah, what makes you a good president might not make you a good father and what we need is a president [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6465.86s)]
*  We just want to be reflected in our presidents [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6471.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6473.82s)]
*  Yeah [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6474.179999999999s)]
*  We want to be reflected in everybody that we see or admire or look up to and the second they have a quality that differs from [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6474.66s)]
*  Us and a quality that we are glad we don't have then we will hold you to the fire [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6480.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they have a quality is different than us but a quality we wish we did have then we admire you for it [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6485.339999999999s)]
*  You're courageous. You're brave. You're confident like all the people looking at prime right now. They're like man [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6490.9s)]
*  I wish I had that confidence man [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6495.5599999999995s)]
*  I wish you go into a situation like that just knows gonna be successful because when your president you're the leader of the free [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6496.86s)]
*  World, it's hard to follow a leader when they have stains on their personality [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6502.38s)]
*  They want them to be perfect in every way. Yeah, we want you to be perfect, but perfect people are [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6506.66s)]
*  Might not make the best president. Yes, the best presidents might be the people who have failed a lot and no [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6512.26s)]
*  You know that the punishment the pain and the repercussions of that failure and will then try to [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6519.42s)]
*  Avoid those failures, you know, it's like somebody who's running a business. I don't want someone who's never ran a business before [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6525.98s)]
*  I want someone who's went through everything maybe one of their business fails and they know exactly why I failed [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6530.9s)]
*  Yeah, that's good because yeah, they got success. I'd rather one of their businesses also fail [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6535.58s)]
*  Just so you know what to do in that situation what you could have done differently [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6539.86s)]
*  Yeah, imagine you never had a business fail all you had a success and now we're starting to fail the fuck [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6543.3s)]
*  you know [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6547.9s)]
*  You don't know jack shit. Yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6549.099999999999s)]
*  Also, Trump is just so arrogant. He's like, you know, my kids are the best my family's the best [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6553.82s)]
*  So you just get that sense that he thinks he's the best [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6557.34s)]
*  So if anyone in his family were to slip up they'd be like, no look whereas Biden [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6559.46s)]
*  Said nothing [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6564.099999999999s)]
*  He's just kind of just been like walking around sort of just like trying his best for years and everyone's like yeah [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6566.34s)]
*  You know, you can't hey gonna blame this guy, you know, I mean, I think people genuinely feel bad for me [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6571.139999999999s)]
*  Do you think he's relaxed [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6575.86s)]
*  Like he's as a person or since he became president or just in general like he is arguably the most stressful job in the world [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6579.42s)]
*  Yeah, of course when there is a Navy SEAL that is hiding in a bunker about to assassinate in that moment [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6586.82s)]
*  That is objectively more stressful. Yeah, but I'm talking about day to day waking up and the decision that you have to make [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6594.2s)]
*  Not just your country they affect the whole world when you leave the world [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6600.0199999999995s)]
*  This is an 8 billion person decision every single time. Do you think he's going? [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6602.66s)]
*  Fuck I got some anxiety today. Like he always seems kind of chill like making jokes. I'm Jill's husband. I like [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6607.74s)]
*  Wouldn't you be panicking? I think he's less stress on average than other you know what's going on [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6615.54s)]
*  And is that to his benefit like to his benefit? [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6620.46s)]
*  If he's not making the decisions already [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6624.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, like if the CIA whoever's making the decisions at least the poor guy has no fucking clothes going on [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6626.54s)]
*  Imagine you weren't making the decisions and everybody thought you were. Yeah. Oh, yeah, no fucking pain and stress [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6633.14s)]

*  Don't think he knew what the fuck was going on. He was chillin. Yeah, it was chillin pro and there's part of me [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8HxWqDFEs&t=6661.58s)]
