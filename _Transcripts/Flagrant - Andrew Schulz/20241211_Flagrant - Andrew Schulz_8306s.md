# CEO Killer & Jay Z Are INNOCENT
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [December 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs)
*  What's up, everybody? Welcome to Flay Grid. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=0.0s)]
*  We got to start off this episode today. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1.76s)]
*  Big shout out to Luigi Mangione on the PEDs. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3.52s)]
*  Look at that bod. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Oh, he was a hater. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7.36s)]
*  You never had abs like that? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=8.32s)]
*  You just never had abs like that. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=9.36s)]
*  I thought it was because I'm pale, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=12.8s)]
*  so the sun doesn't hit it different. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=13.92s)]
*  And you guys, it hits it different. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  This guy is about to be the most beloved cold-blooded murderer. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=16.64s)]
*  This is like prison bed. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=19.44s)]
*  This is like prison bed. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=22.0s)]
*  I mean, he's a handsome guy. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=23.12s)]
*  Handsome guy. I was laughing trying to hate. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=24.32s)]
*  You were hating. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=26.48s)]
*  I was laughing because Biles was so quick to put it up. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  Before we talk about how great this guy is, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=32.24s)]
*  can we just talk about how horrible the CEO was? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=34.72s)]
*  Because that will give us a little bit more. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=37.36s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  So do you guys know anything about the CEO? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=42.64s)]
*  OK. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=43.2s)]
*  Really nice guy. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=43.599999999999994s)]
*  OK, tell me about him. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  No, just salt of the earth. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=44.96s)]
*  Salt of the earth, family man, golden retriever. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=45.76s)]
*  No, it's interesting. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=48.32s)]
*  Some people pointed out, I think even Bill Burris on his pockets, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=49.44s)]
*  he's like, these guys are gangsters. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=51.84s)]
*  They sit like, yeah, they got families. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=53.68s)]
*  They're putting in basically policies within the organization [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=56.24s)]
*  to withhold coverage from people. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=59.92s)]
*  Of course. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=61.84s)]
*  All these health care companies, in order for them to make money, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=62.4s)]
*  they have to deny coverage. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=64.8s)]
*  That's the way it works. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=65.76s)]
*  And they're publicly traded companies. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=66.56s)]
*  And the consumer mission is like, OK, we're going to help the people. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=68.16s)]
*  We're going to actually help people that need care. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=71.28s)]
*  So a CEO's job is to remove as much coverage as possible. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=72.56s)]
*  That's precise. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=75.2s)]
*  You can make the most money for the company. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=76.0s)]
*  Because you have to give responsibility to the shareholders of your publicly traded company. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=77.36s)]
*  To deny people who need health care is how you make the company profitable. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=80.8s)]
*  Precisely. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=86.08s)]
*  While at the same time getting them to continue to pay. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=86.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=88.8s)]
*  Precisely. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=89.12s)]
*  Convince you to pay them money and then not help them when they need it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=89.6s)]
*  Correct. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=92.56s)]
*  Kill that motherfucker. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  I'm just saying, kill that motherfucker. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=95.28s)]
*  Like, kill that motherfucker. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=97.6s)]
*  Actually, don't kill him. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=100.0s)]
*  You know what you should do? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=100.8s)]
*  You should make sweet love to him. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=101.44s)]
*  Well, we should have made sweet love to him. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=104.16s)]
*  Bro, I'm just saying, I would let this guy fuck me. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=106.24s)]
*  No, no, not this guy. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  I would let him fuck me. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=109.84s)]
*  He just made like, he just made like, come on. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=110.72s)]
*  What if we make sweet love to the CEO of UnitedHealthcare? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=113.84s)]
*  And all of the healthcare CEOs. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=116.88000000000001s)]
*  What if they get made sweet love to? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=119.28s)]
*  You know what? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=120.72s)]
*  Then when he goes to the psychiatrist for a sexual trauma, deny the claim. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=121.2s)]
*  Deny! [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=124.56s)]
*  You got to deny the ad. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=125.04s)]
*  Deny, deny, deny. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=125.84s)]
*  Deal with that shit. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=127.04s)]
*  You enjoyed it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=127.92s)]
*  I want your cheeks up on the wall. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=129.28s)]
*  I want to cast your cheeks. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  I want to get mold in your cheeks. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=132.08s)]
*  I want to put them up on the wall. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=133.28s)]
*  I don't think you're allowed to make jokes about... [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=133.68s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=135.84s)]
*  You're taking it too far. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=136.8s)]
*  So I'm just going to make a mold of his cheeks and put it up on the wall like a deer head. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=137.84s)]
*  You're going to mount it? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  That's... [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to mount the cheeks on the wall. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=145.6s)]
*  A couple different ways. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=147.84s)]
*  All the cheeks I get, I got to have a room in my house where I put all the cheeks that I make sweet love to. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=148.96s)]
*  He's a little stocky, so those are some heavy cheeks right there. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=154.24s)]
*  Oh, we're going to go to a professional. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  Not him. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=158.0s)]
*  We're going to go to a real, we're going to go to a real mounter. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=158.72s)]
*  You know, we're going to go to someone who deals with big animals like an elk or something like that. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=161.68s)]
*  Dill, you're telling me you can't make sweet love to a UnitedHealthcare CEO who's trying to deny coverage to people who need it? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=167.84s)]
*  I mean... [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=175.68s)]
*  Oh, of course you could. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=176.32s)]
*  Enough people hate him, so I think... [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=177.04s)]
*  Enough people hate him, you're totally fine. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  Like, what if we found out instead of killing him, someone just butt-fucked him on the street at Times Square? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=180.56s)]
*  Bring it back to the 80s. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=184.8s)]
*  An Elmo? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=186.96s)]
*  Peeps, yo. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=187.44s)]
*  Dude, if an Elmo fucked, that's healthcare for you. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  Elmo brought out that Mexican dick and just butt-fucked the UnitedHealth CEO. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=190.24s)]
*  That would be fire. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=194.88s)]
*  It would. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  The churros for everybody. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=196.48s)]
*  But yeah, there's a whole bunch of shit like this. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=199.11999999999998s)]
*  Like, I'm pretty sure even during COVID, all these hospitals went bankrupt and they had to roll them all up into one thing, so now they're all owned by private equity. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=200.48s)]
*  All these doctors are getting surgeries they don't really need to do and they're getting kickbacks from the fucking, you know, medical sales companies. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=206.72s)]
*  It's a very unethical job to have. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=213.28s)]
*  There's another one that actually just got repealed, so technically this guy already did one good thing so far. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=215.28s)]
*  You know, despite killing people, which is bad. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  He did one thing. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=221.2s)]
*  Killing person. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=221.76s)]
*  Killing person. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=222.95999999999998s)]
*  I'm talking about people. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=223.67999999999998s)]
*  Person. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=224.48s)]
*  That's true. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=225.04s)]
*  He killed way less people than that healthcare CEO. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=225.6s)]
*  Someone did a death count. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=227.44s)]
*  They said he killed, they accumulated over his time as CEO in this specific position, it was like 40,000 people or something like that. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=228.4s)]
*  Have died because he denied them coverage. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=235.44s)]
*  This is what they're estimating, yes. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  And it's a little indirect, but yes. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=238.56s)]
*  That's a genocide. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=239.68s)]
*  That is a genocide. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=241.92s)]
*  That's a genocide. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=242.72s)]
*  He killed more people than Osama. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=243.84s)]

*  Like- [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=711.12s)]
*  Not to go. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=711.44s)]
*  Dine in. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=712.8800000000001s)]
*  That's far. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=714.08s)]
*  That level of comfort is amazing. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=714.96s)]
*  He's not that dumb. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=716.88s)]
*  A guy like that doesn't make sense. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=718.08s)]
*  He'd be that dumb. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=719.44s)]
*  Didn't he go to college in Pennsylvania? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=720.08s)]
*  So he's going to- [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=722.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=722.72s)]
*  Altoona, he went to college in Philly, UPenn. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=723.04s)]
*  Then he went to Penn State Altoona. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=725.76s)]
*  That's not even- [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=727.9200000000001s)]
*  That's like an offshoot satellite school or whatever. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=728.64s)]
*  It's not even the real Penn State. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=732.24s)]
*  So there's- [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=733.84s)]
*  I've been to Altoona. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=734.4s)]
*  Ain't no fucking reason to go to Altoona. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=735.36s)]
*  No, I'm just saying- [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=736.96s)]
*  Unless you're doing a Wild'N Out comedy show there. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=738.0s)]
*  Or you're running from a murder. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=740.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=741.52s)]
*  But even then, you got the foreign currency. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=742.24s)]
*  Just go across country lines, whatever. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=744.0s)]
*  Whatever fucking currency you got, go there. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=745.52s)]
*  He's not a dumb person. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=747.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=749.4399999999999s)]
*  I think, well, one, he probably wasn't online that much [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=749.84s)]
*  because he probably threw away his phone. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=752.4s)]
*  And so he probably didn't know they were- [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=754.4s)]
*  So you thought nobody was looking for him? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=755.68s)]
*  He didn't throw away his phone. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=757.12s)]
*  Oh, he didn't? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=758.16s)]
*  So apparently- [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=758.56s)]
*  So there's another thing that came up in the court [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=759.1999999999999s)]
*  is that they said that he had Faraday bags, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=760.8s)]
*  which is basically like a bag, like almost- [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=762.8s)]
*  You can think of like a yonder bag, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=764.64s)]
*  but it basically disrupts the cell signal [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=765.84s)]
*  from getting in or out so you can't be traced. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=768.0s)]
*  And they said this is indication of criminal sophistication. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=770.0s)]
*  And he says, I picked this bag because it's waterproof. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=773.52s)]
*  It has nothing to do with criminal sophistication. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=776.4s)]
*  You think this is a ballfucker, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=777.6s)]
*  they planted that much shit on this guy. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=778.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=780.32s)]
*  But this is the thing where I'm like, okay, he is super smart, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=782.72s)]
*  but maybe he's like going through a mental episode [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=785.28s)]
*  or is like a narcissist or something [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=788.0s)]
*  because he's speaking in court without an attorney. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=789.52s)]
*  Which if you're like, you know, above average intelligent persons, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=792.96s)]
*  you know once you get into court, don't say shit. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=796.64s)]
*  Just be like, hey, I need legal representation. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=798.72s)]
*  I'm going to keep my mouth shut. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=800.16s)]
*  So that would indicate to me like, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=801.36s)]
*  oh, he feels pretty confident about his position with the judge. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=802.5600000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=806.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=807.04s)]
*  Because he knows he's innocent, yo. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=807.92s)]
*  He knows the truth is on his side. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=809.76s)]
*  Wait a minute, that changes things for me. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=811.6s)]
*  If he's choosing to defend himself- [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=814.0s)]
*  But he's not, he didn't choose to defend himself. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=815.6800000000001s)]
*  He's just in front of the judge. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=817.36s)]
*  God bless you in the name of the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=818.5600000000001s)]
*  And I was wet. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=819.6800000000001s)]
*  It was all over my shoulder. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=820.8000000000001s)]
*  I can smell it. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=821.84s)]
*  I have smelly sneezes. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=823.2s)]
*  What the hell? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=824.32s)]
*  But my farts don't smell. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=824.96s)]
*  That's false. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=826.5600000000001s)]
*  That's actually false, completely false. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=827.2s)]
*  It's only if I allow it. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=828.8000000000001s)]
*  How come your sneezes smell like shit? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=830.72s)]
*  Because I can't control the smell of my sneeze, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=832.72s)]
*  but my farts, I can't keep that in. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=834.16s)]
*  I can't keep that in. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=836.88s)]
*  And it just decomposes my body. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=838.3199999999999s)]
*  Bro, have you ever sneezed and woke up your baby [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=840.24s)]
*  and your wife freaks out at you? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=841.68s)]
*  No, but I farted and woken up my wife, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=842.72s)]
*  and she's really happy about it. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=844.24s)]
*  Yeah, she really enjoys that. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=847.6s)]
*  It's my favorite way to wake up. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=849.12s)]
*  And then when she wakes up, I go, ah! [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=850.48s)]
*  And then I say, she farted. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=853.6s)]
*  My wife farted the other day. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=856.48s)]
*  While we're in bed, she woke herself up, farted. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=858.5600000000001s)]
*  She was so embarrassed that she put the covers over her head. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=860.72s)]
*  And I was like, don't go down there. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=863.0400000000001s)]
*  It's ground zero. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=866.32s)]
*  She's like, touch out there. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=867.2800000000001s)]
*  Last show of the tour, okay? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=870.4s)]
*  Honolulu, Hawaii. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=872.88s)]
*  All right? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=874.24s)]
*  We'll see you guys all there, the Blindsdale Arena. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=874.88s)]
*  We'll see the protesters there as well. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=877.2800000000001s)]

*  when I wasn't even really moving tickets. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=937.44s)]
*  So you better buy tickets as actually, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=938.88s)]
*  because it's gonna go quickly. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=940.08s)]
*  Also, January 30th and February 1st, I'm gonna be in Des Moines. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=941.36s)]
*  I'm very excited to go to Des Moines, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=944.96s)]
*  because you know, sometimes you're just trying to like [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=946.48s)]

*  I don't know why the fuck you would have directions for Des Moines, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=955.52s)]
*  but I'm gonna be there at the Funny Bone in West Des Moines. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=958.96s)]

*  Also, if you go to the website, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=963.76s)]
*  my eyes look really pretty on the top banner. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=965.2s)]
*  I don't know who did the Photoshop, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=967.36s)]
*  or maybe that's my natural eye color. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=969.12s)]
*  I fucked those eyes. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=970.72s)]
*  See y'all there. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=971.9200000000001s)]
*  Back to Luigi. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=972.64s)]
*  Yeah, fucking Luigi, man. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=973.36s)]
*  Put a different picture up, man. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=974.96s)]
*  This is too crazy. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=976.0s)]
*  I can't. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=976.88s)]
*  All the pictures are so- [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=977.6s)]
*  Mugshot, he's in yellow too. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=978.64s)]
*  Yeah, it is crazy. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=980.4000000000001s)]
*  But, so he's talking to the judge in court. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=981.52s)]
*  I don't think he's like legally defending himself. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=983.6s)]
*  Like, I don't think he's like, I'm denying representation. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=985.52s)]
*  But I think he is going back and forth with the judge. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=988.1600000000001s)]
*  Wait, so you guys don't think he went crazy? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=992.24s)]
*  No, no, he probably went crazy. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=995.36s)]
*  It's just more fun to say that he's just like a vigilante hero. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=996.72s)]
*  But two things can be true, right? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=999.84s)]
*  You can be a crazy vigilante hero. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1001.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1002.64s)]
*  But it is rare that people like bad, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1003.28s)]
*  people we perceive to be bad get killed. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1007.28s)]
*  Yes, bad things usually don't happen to bad people. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1010.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1013.1999999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1014.16s)]
*  This is one of those rare cases. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1014.8s)]
*  It's just nice to see gun violence bringing people together. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1016.0799999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1018.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1018.98s)]
*  It's just nice to see an act of senseless crime [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1019.28s)]
*  bring in the whole country like, yes. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1021.36s)]
*  It did bring. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1022.64s)]
*  Both sides were just like- [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1023.4399999999999s)]
*  We can fight behind something. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1024.48s)]
*  It ain't senseless. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1025.36s)]
*  Anybody who ever had to pay for their own health insurance, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1026.8799999999999s)]
*  this made the most sense. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1028.8s)]
*  I think Americans are ready for central health care, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1029.92s)]
*  whatever it is. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1032.32s)]
*  What is it called? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1034.08s)]
*  Central health care. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1034.56s)]
*  Universal health care. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1035.4399999999998s)]
*  If you want that to happen, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1036.08s)]
*  mark out a couple more of these guys. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1038.6399999999999s)]
*  You get all the coverage you want. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1039.84s)]
*  Do you remember when we were talking about this? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1040.72s)]
*  We were like, okay, there's going to come a time where there's a [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1042.0s)]
*  wealth disparity and it'll be like a violent revolution or political revolution. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1045.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1048.56s)]
*  We're getting close. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1049.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1050.08s)]
*  We're getting close. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1050.48s)]
*  But you can, like rich people basically, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1051.2s)]
*  the super, super, super, super rich [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1053.4399999999998s)]
*  have to make sure that the super poor have just enough to get by. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1055.9199999999998s)]
*  The second they don't have enough to get by, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1059.52s)]
*  then they're going to, okay, we're going to storm that person's fucking estate [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1061.12s)]
*  and we're going to kill his whole family, et cetera. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1063.9199999999998s)]
*  And that's what happens here. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1065.6s)]
*  So a way to keep them poor, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1066.9599999999998s)]
*  but keep them happy, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1070.8799999999999s)]
*  would be to just give them universal health care. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1072.6399999999999s)]
*  And that will get you a few more years. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1076.3999999999999s)]
*  It's going to take some money off of your bottom dollar, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1078.6399999999999s)]
*  but you'll find a way to just put on the middle class [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1081.12s)]
*  or put on the kind of rich like they always do. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1082.8799999999999s)]
*  But that is a way to keep them out of your pockets [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1085.1999999999998s)]
*  or keep them from storing your estate for a few more decades. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1087.4399999999998s)]
*  Decades, yeah. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1090.08s)]
*  You get a couple more decades and eventually they'll be like, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1091.0400000000002s)]
*  hold on, I can't eat, but I can go get my neck fixed. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1093.1200000000001s)]
*  This is fucked up. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1095.3600000000001s)]
*  And they're going to shoot another one of you. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1096.64s)]
*  But this is a good sign that it's time to start taking care of the people [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1098.24s)]
*  because he wasn't poor. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1101.92s)]
*  No, he's like one of the wealthier families. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1103.3600000000001s)]
*  His cousin is a delegate in Maryland. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1105.2800000000002s)]
*  He's some type of like political office. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1108.5600000000002s)]
*  Really? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1110.4s)]
*  Yeah, Nino Mangione. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1110.8000000000002s)]
*  Weird thing, the whole family owns a bunch of nursing homes [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1112.0800000000002s)]
*  and they have really bad ratings. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1115.3600000000001s)]
*  So I'm like, if yours should be upset at somebody, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1118.16s)]
*  probably should be upset at your own family. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1121.52s)]
*  He didn't talk to his family for like three, six months, whatever. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1122.8000000000002s)]
*  No one knew what happened to him. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1124.88s)]
*  It's just interesting like why is he, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1127.52s)]
*  the anger being directed at the health insurance company [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1129.76s)]
*  when your family is really not doing a good job taking care of old people. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1132.88s)]
*  That's a good one. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1137.28s)]
*  I didn't know that they had nursing homes. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1138.3200000000002s)]
*  Oh yeah, they own like a bunch, like probably like 10 to 12. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1139.68s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1142.96s)]
*  Take it to the top, baby. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1143.44s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1145.0400000000002s)]
*  There's a little, they apparently had this back injury. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1145.6s)]
*  I don't know if that's real. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1148.3999999999999s)]
*  But this like lingering back injury. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1150.08s)]
*  Getting surgery. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1152.0s)]
*  Again, this is kind of one of the stories people are saying. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1153.1999999999998s)]
*  I don't know if it's the case, but it's like he was in Hawaii. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1154.9599999999998s)]
*  He was surfing, injured his back, gets back surgery. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1157.12s)]
*  Apparently there's like a whole back surgery racket that happens. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1160.8s)]
*  I was looking at this also where like they're overdiagnosed [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1163.36s)]
*  and oftentimes like the saying that people go through, go with is like, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1166.1599999999999s)]
*  the first surgery is optional, the second surgery isn't. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1169.76s)]
*  And so like these doctors will just like do back surgery [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1172.48s)]
*  and then they have chronic back pain forever because the doctor's [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1174.24s)]
*  getting kickbacks for the back surgeries and yada yada yada. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1176.96s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1179.6s)]
*  Is what people are saying. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1180.4s)]
*  And so it's possible that he was wrapped up in that. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1181.84s)]
*  He feels manipulated, taken advantage of, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1184.32s)]
*  and now for the rest of his life he's in pain. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1185.92s)]
*  So they're looking at his like book recommendations, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1187.6s)]
*  like the books he read and there's a ton of like back pain books. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1189.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1192.0s)]
*  And so he's like reading about this shit, he's feeling angry. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1192.4s)]
*  He maybe did like some people say he did like ayahuasca. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1195.44s)]
*  To get through it. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1198.08s)]
*  And like that was partially part of it. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1198.88s)]
*  So like he was angry, traumatized, hyper-intelligent. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1201.2s)]
*  And then goes potentially crazy, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1204.32s)]
*  doesn't talk to his family for three, six months, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1206.64s)]
*  and then forms his plan. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1208.56s)]
*  Yikes. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1209.84s)]
*  Comes back a fucking superhero. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1210.16s)]
*  What a fucking story. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1215.6s)]
*  Dude, mom's what we're talking about is it feels like Batman. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1216.96s)]
*  Like imagine he doesn't get caught and he keeps going. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1218.96s)]
*  But he kills people, he's not much cooler. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1220.72s)]
*  But he goes after other billionaires. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1222.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1223.92s)]
*  Imagine he keeps on finding billionaires. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1224.08s)]
*  Dexter. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1225.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1226.24s)]
*  And then he tries to kill Bruce Wayne. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1226.64s)]
*  And then that's where the episode of Batman starts. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1228.96s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1231.2s)]
*  I mean there is something interesting, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1233.92s)]
*  because Dexter the idea was that... [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1234.96s)]
*  Serial killer that kills other serial killers, right? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1237.28s)]
*  Oh I thought he was serial killer that just kills bad people. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1239.6000000000001s)]
*  Maybe it goes there, but I think the idea was serial killers. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1241.8400000000001s)]
*  Serial killers kill bad people, serial killers. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1243.76s)]
*  I think it's like sort of both. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1246.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1247.2s)]
*  But essentially to kill someone that stole copper pipes. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1247.52s)]
*  Like he's not killing good people, he's killing murderers or... [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1250.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1253.92s)]
*  It probably gets to that point, yeah. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1254.88s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1256.0800000000002s)]
*  But the idea is that... [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1256.3200000000002s)]
*  But the idea is so he has to feed that need. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1257.04s)]
*  So he's going to find a way to do it that like helps society. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1259.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1262.16s)]
*  Which now we can like him. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1262.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1264.0s)]
*  Robin Hood is a kleptomaniac. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1264.4s)]
*  And wants to help out poor people while he's at it. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1266.0s)]
*  Because I don't feel guilty. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1267.84s)]
*  That's great. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1268.88s)]
*  That's all Robin Hood is. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1269.92s)]
*  He's a fucking klepto. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1271.1200000000001s)]
*  Anyway, so I wonder if other CEOs for these companies right now [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1272.64s)]
*  are looking at how the public is reacting. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1278.56s)]
*  Not either a crazy person is going to try to murder you. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1281.04s)]
*  There can always be a crazy person that's going to try to murder any of us, right? [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1283.6000000000001s)]
*  But the public reaction and they're going, whoa, I'm hated. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1287.04s)]
*  My job is hated. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1292.08s)]
*  When I tell people what I do for a living, they hate me. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1293.12s)]
*  They despise me. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1296.3999999999999s)]
*  And they think that how I contribute to the world is repugnant. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1297.76s)]
*  And I wonder if that weighs on them. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1302.32s)]
*  And they start going, I don't want to be thought of by that this way by my community. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1303.9199999999998s)]
*  Or I wonder if they're such sociopaths that they go, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1308.32s)]
*  ah, fuck it, this is how I make money. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1310.8799999999999s)]
*  Here's what I... [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1312.3999999999999s)]
*  This is going to be like some cucky shit probably. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1313.52s)]
*  I'll say it. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1315.9199999999998s)]
*  This thing that they all hide behind, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1317.36s)]
*  healthcare insurance companies and food companies. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1319.04s)]
*  When they go public, oh, our fiduciary responsibilities to the shareholder. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1321.6s)]
*  I almost think you shouldn't be allowed to go public if you're a health insurance company, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1325.6799999999998s)]
*  a healthcare company, a food company. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1328.48s)]
*  Because then... [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1330.1599999999999s)]
*  A conflict of interest. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1330.7199999999998s)]
*  Food is full of bullshit. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1331.84s)]
*  And what they hide behind is we're publicly traded. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1333.28s)]
*  That's a great point. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1335.6799999999998s)]
*  This is medicine and food for the people. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1336.7199999999998s)]
*  But you get to hide behind, if I'm Brian Thompson, I'm doing my job. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1339.1999999999998s)]
*  All right, so can I ask you a question? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1343.6s)]
*  What would be the alternative argument to that? [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1344.6399999999999s)]
*  I guess it's just anti-capitalist. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1349.28s)]
*  It just seems a little socialist to not let these guys go, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1351.6s)]
*  to not let healthcare companies, food companies go public. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1354.1599999999999s)]
*  Oh, we can't get the funding we need to expand the business the way we want to or whatever. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1357.04s)]
*  They would hide behind that. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1360.24s)]
*  But... [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1361.36s)]
*  Anti-research and development. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1361.76s)]
*  The reason that a lot of these like drug companies say that they should be public is because... [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1363.1999999999998s)]
*  They need the money to do the R&D to profit off the drugs. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1366.8s)]
*  Yeah, which is true. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1370.0s)]
*  The entire world benefits from our drug R&D. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1371.6799999999998s)]
*  Okay, that would make sense for pharma. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1374.56s)]
*  What about health insurance companies? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1376.24s)]
*  Why does UnitedHealth... [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1377.76s)]
*  Hey. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1379.84s)]
*  No, I'm not... [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1380.56s)]
*  I'm not... [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1381.36s)]
*  UnitedHealth is not developing the instruments and machines to cure people. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1383.9199999999998s)]
*  And I know you're not on their side. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1387.12s)]
*  I'm just curious, what would be the argument for them if you're playing devil's advocate? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1388.24s)]
*  I mean, I don't have a good one for insurance. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1391.52s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think... [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1393.84s)]
*  And food companies, again. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1394.6399999999999s)]
*  That's a really... [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1395.6799999999998s)]
*  Now, the food company one is tricky because there is a lot of R&D when it comes to food. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1398.08s)]
*  And unfortunately, that R&D might lead to like way worse things for us. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1402.48s)]
*  But it is... [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1407.04s)]
*  That's how you make more food more addictive. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1407.9199999999998s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1410.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1410.64s)]
*  So maybe you eliminate that and the food gets healthier. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1411.1200000000001s)]
*  You can literally start a fucking GoFundMe. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1412.8000000000002s)]
*  You guys want to do Doritos flavor? [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1415.44s)]
*  Here you go. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1417.1200000000001s)]
*  Five dollars to the GoFundMe. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1418.4s)]
*  I mean, this is Kickstarter. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1420.5600000000002s)]
*  What do we like? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1422.16s)]
*  I don't think this is... [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1423.1200000000001s)]
*  Because again, if the goal is to maximize profits for the shareholder, I'm going to... [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1424.3200000000002s)]
*  In-N-Out never had a... [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1430.4s)]
*  Isn't a publicly traded business. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1432.48s)]
*  Very wealthy. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1434.16s)]
*  That's just slaps. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1435.0400000000002s)]
*  Like, so let's not act like you need to be publicly traded. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1435.8400000000001s)]
*  Chipotle, the quality fell to dogshit. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1437.76s)]
*  It's publicly traded. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1439.76s)]
*  And because you get to say, well, I could use this really high quality chicken, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1440.64s)]
*  but it costs more. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1444.4s)]
*  So I'm going to use a lower quality chicken, but that's okay because my primary responsibility [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1445.52s)]
*  is not to the people I'm feeding. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1450.16s)]
*  It's to the shareholder. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1451.44s)]
*  Akash, sometimes you make some great ass points. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1452.8799999999999s)]
*  You... [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1456.4s)]
*  It don't happen often. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1456.8799999999999s)]
*  No, but no, for real, this is a great ass point. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1458.08s)]
*  You stop being responsible to your customers. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1460.0s)]
*  And now your customers become this conduit to making your shareholders more money. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1463.1999999999998s)]
*  You're actually, in a lot of ways, poisoning your customers. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1470.1599999999999s)]
*  And that relationship then is one of animosity, where there's like, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1474.3999999999999s)]
*  okay, maybe I like this food, but also I hate the service and I hate all these things. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1478.3999999999999s)]
*  The businesses that are there to serve the customers, like In-N-Out, for example, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1482.56s)]
*  they always hear about, oh, they're paying their employees $15 an hour, $20 an hour. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1486.32s)]
*  They're playing way above minimum wage. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1490.8799999999999s)]
*  When you walk into that bitch, they're happy. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1492.88s)]
*  They're happy. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1494.5600000000002s)]

*  You feel great. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1496.4s)]
*  You walk into some of these fast food restaurants and it looks like it's on a sink. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1498.4s)]
*  They're trying to say you murdered a CEO. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1501.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, bro, I'm trying to get a ticket. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1503.2s)]
*  They're snitching because they're not getting paid right. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1504.96s)]
*  There is no way an In-N-Out employee would have snitched on Manjoni. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1507.68s)]
*  No. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1510.8000000000002s)]

*  Bernie bros are listening like, yes, they finally get it. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1515.8400000000001s)]
*  Social response. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1519.2800000000002s)]
*  Finally. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1520.48s)]
*  Let's fucking go. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1521.2s)]
*  I love this. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1522.32s)]
*  That's a fucking great. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1522.96s)]
*  Let's cook it. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1523.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, we're cooking right now. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1524.56s)]
*  Yeah, fucking cooking. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1525.28s)]
*  So that is a great example. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1526.1599999999999s)]
*  Should healthcare companies be publicly traded? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1528.6399999999999s)]
*  Because now your responsibility is no longer to the people you're trying to take care of. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1531.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1535.6799999999998s)]
*  And the same thing with food. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1536.08s)]
*  What other businesses shouldn't be publicly traded? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1537.04s)]
*  Those are the two that come to mind. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1540.08s)]
*  Let's say, for example, a bridge could be a publicly traded company. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1541.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1547.4399999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1548.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1548.8799999999999s)]
*  Be responsible for me getting over to the other side. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1549.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1552.4799999999998s)]
*  Don't be responsible for some guy in Arizona who invested in this bridge company. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1553.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1556.2399999999998s)]
*  The George Washington bridge, the Brooklyn bridge, those motherfuckers got to serve us. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1556.7199999999998s)]
*  And nobody else. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1560.8799999999999s)]
*  Thousand percent. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1562.1599999999999s)]
*  Same thing should apply. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1562.7199999999998s)]
*  The only things that come to my mind are essentially medicine, which is food and actual [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1563.6799999999998s)]
*  healthcare. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1568.56s)]
*  I guess you could say medicine. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1568.9599999999998s)]
*  You thought of this right now? [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1570.4799999999998s)]
*  No, I've been thinking this and this just proved to me that there was something here. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1571.76s)]
*  People have to say this. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1575.12s)]
*  No, I'm just saying every once in a while, he starts acting like a real Indian. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1575.52s)]
*  Fucking Indian. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1582.0800000000002s)]
*  I know. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1582.72s)]
*  I know. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1583.2s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1583.6000000000001s)]
*  Sometimes his little Punjabi brain is working. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1584.0800000000002s)]
*  But when you start asking him, can you do that? [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1588.3200000000002s)]
*  There was no Carmen in that group. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1591.2s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1592.48s)]
*  Hey, I agree. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1596.48s)]
*  You're all fucking. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1597.1200000000001s)]
*  Sometimes I'm Carmen. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1597.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1601.28s)]
*  He was going full Punjabi. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1601.8400000000001s)]
*  Because you also need the Punjabis to fucking throw it down. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1603.68s)]
*  When it's more, they're about that action. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1607.76s)]
*  And you need that version of them too. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1610.3200000000002s)]
*  He took out the bracelet. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1611.92s)]

*  Hands up. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1613.76s)]
*  I want to smoke with everybody. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1615.92s)]
*  That's what you need. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1617.6000000000001s)]
*  We can't do no Punjabi because it's going to be too passive. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1618.3200000000002s)]
*  It's a little bit too passive. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1621.68s)]
*  But sometimes you need that Hindu to come up and start making them crazy ass points. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1622.5600000000002s)]
*  And then when they say your points are stupid, that Punjabi comes in. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1626.64s)]
*  Meet you at the corner of the parking lot. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1630.48s)]
*  You want to drink it right now? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1633.68s)]
*  Let me just drink it. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1634.88s)]
*  You start drinking. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1636.96s)]
*  Can you get it? [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1638.0s)]
*  Don't let me bring my elephant through. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1641.28s)]
*  Stop all you motherfuckers. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1643.8400000000001s)]
*  That'd be a problem. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1644.96s)]
*  G's up, dude. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1645.68s)]
*  But yeah, I think that's true. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1648.16s)]
*  And the American people want it. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1650.24s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1653.52s)]
*  Universal Health Care. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1654.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1655.2s)]
*  I think that's that is a starting point because you don't actually. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1655.68s)]
*  And honestly, I don't think you care that much about shareholder profits, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1659.2s)]
*  but you get to use that as a shield. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1662.24s)]
*  Oh, it's all about you want your own profits. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1663.92s)]
*  The shareholders are secondary to what you want, but you get to hide behind that. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1666.4s)]
*  Every business person says your primary, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1669.92s)]
*  financial, whatever responsibility is bullshit. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1671.76s)]
*  Take that away from them. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1674.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's because the board can fire people that aren't making the company money. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1675.76s)]
*  Yeah, and they get to hide behind that same fucking excuse. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1678.96s)]
*  So now you're not publicly traded. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1681.1200000000001s)]
*  Now why are you pieces of shit? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1683.1200000000001s)]
*  My parents used to always say this, how lucky they were that they did something ethical for a living. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1685.52s)]
*  They would always say that to me. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1690.4s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1691.52s)]
*  They're like, yeah, we just teach people how to dance and they really enjoy it and they love it. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1691.92s)]
*  And it feels really good that we get to have this opportunity to provide for ourselves. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1695.84s)]
*  There are a lot of people that do things that are potentially unethical. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1700.0s)]
*  And they brought up the insurance thing. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1703.36s)]
*  Like somebody has to go to somebody's house that gets torn apart by a hurricane [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1704.96s)]
*  and say, well, technically you didn't board your windows. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1708.8799999999999s)]
*  And if you had boarded your windows, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1710.96s)]
*  it would have destroyed your living room and your kitchen. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1712.16s)]
*  So we're not going to repay your living room and kitchen. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1714.16s)]
*  And then. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1716.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1717.36s)]

*  And we get to come on this podcast and just talk about making love to little guys. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1722.08s)]
*  They're little rascals. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1728.9599999999998s)]
*  We'll make love to little rascals. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1730.0s)]
*  So unethical. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1731.36s)]
*  It's ethical. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1732.24s)]
*  Like we get to tell our children about that. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1733.04s)]
*  Our children one day will watch this and be like, damn, those crazy fuckers. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1736.6399999999999s)]

*  Why would I waste this sun? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1799.28s)]
*  Let me throw this shit down in Los Angeles where they need it. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1802.56s)]
*  That's why people from Boston are so funny because it's like, you're that ugly, you gotta at least be funny. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1805.2s)]
*  You gotta shop it up. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1811.44s)]
*  Even the women up there are funny. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1812.72s)]
*  A lot of Indiana is on the list of ugly cities, by the way. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1814.96s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1817.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1818.24s)]
*  Because they try to say the most attractive city and they're like, oh, it's Boston. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1818.72s)]
*  It's something. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1822.4s)]
*  Maybe, yeah. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1822.96s)]
*  They always try to make a splash with these lists. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1823.68s)]
*  No, the most attractive city is probably LA, right? [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1825.6000000000001s)]
*  No, it's New York. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1828.8s)]
*  I feel New York is underrated to be on TV. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1829.6000000000001s)]
*  New York for sure. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1831.28s)]
*  I mean, I agree. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1833.04s)]
*  We look good even in the wintertime. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1833.84s)]
*  Can I be honest with you? [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1835.36s)]
*  You know how hard that is? [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1836.3999999999999s)]
*  Can I be honest with you? [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1837.12s)]
*  It's also diverse beauty. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1837.9199999999998s)]
*  LA, the hottest girls are like, they're not out. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1839.76s)]
*  You don't see them. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1842.6399999999999s)]
*  Can I just be honest? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1843.1999999999998s)]
*  There's too many intelligent people in New York for it to be the hottest. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1845.28s)]
*  There is, the thing about LA is there's no need for intelligence at all. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1851.76s)]
*  Pretty much all jobs in LA can be done by literal retards. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1858.9599999999998s)]
*  And because we have... [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1864.24s)]
*  We have Luigi's though. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1865.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1866.1599999999999s)]
*  Intelligent hot people. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1866.56s)]
*  Wait, where is he from? [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1867.6799999999998s)]
*  I thought he's from Pennsylvania. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1869.04s)]
*  Yeah, but he's from Maryland. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1870.0s)]
*  He moved over here. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1871.6799999999998s)]
*  Northeast, Northeast. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1872.8s)]
*  We'll take Northeast. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1874.24s)]
*  You claim them? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1874.8799999999999s)]
*  We're not claiming them. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1875.6s)]
*  What I'm trying to say is... [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1876.56s)]
*  Oh, if it's natives only, then even LA don't count, New York don't count, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1877.9199999999998s)]
*  because all the hot people move there. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1881.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1882.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but then eventually it accumulates. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1883.04s)]
*  Okay, so we have people moving, but so with the people moving, it's fine. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1884.56s)]
*  So New York, you have to have some level of intelligence to live here, right? [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1887.6799999999998s)]
*  Because there's not as many jobs for retards as there is in LA. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1892.72s)]
*  That's true. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1897.92s)]
*  So unfortunately... [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1899.04s)]
*  If you have to have some level of intelligence, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1900.56s)]
*  how do you explain all Dove's girls? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1902.08s)]

*  I have to stand outside Tommy Hilfiger store and hold the surfboard for 8 hours a day. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1920.88s)]
*  And then he waits until it's like their last two days here so you don't have to break out? [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1926.0s)]
*  He's a genius, bro. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1931.76s)]
*  Would you like to pay for the citizenship so I can stand outside Tommy Hilfiger store [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1932.24s)]
*  and hold the surfboard? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=1936.64s)]

*  So there was this fight between Ian Gary and Shavkat Rachmanov, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2170.18s)]
*  I think his name, I'm probably mispronouncing. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2176.82s)]
*  Which was phenomenal. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2179.62s)]
*  Like, Shavkat is supposedly the boogeyman in the division. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2180.66s)]
*  Ian Gary comes out on like three weeks notice. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2183.06s)]

*  And then she wrote that book, which is a satirical book, but obviously everybody's, you know, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2201.62s)]
*  or it's incredibly accurate. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2206.1s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2207.7s)]

*  She's way older than him. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2215.62s)]
*  She locked him down, made him change his name to include her name. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2216.58s)]
*  And like a lot of on the surface, you're like, this is fucked. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2219.62s)]
*  Then you read the book and it's like clearly like a joke. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2222.2599999999998s)]

*  And you looked at him and be like, he's only a striker. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2241.7s)]

*  You want to see that? [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2390.9s)]
*  OK. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2391.54s)]
*  I want to see another rematch. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2391.86s)]
*  Maybe down the line, they both get another fight or two. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2392.98s)]
*  But I think this was one of those reality checks for Ian. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2394.98s)]
*  Because he had all this hype and there's all this criticism. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2398.26s)]
*  And then he goes and fights the scariest guy in the division. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2400.42s)]
*  So they say, this is the guy who's going to fight Balal next. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2402.82s)]
*  OK. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2405.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2406.02s)]
*  And he fights him. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2406.74s)]
*  That's a tough fight. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2409.8599999999997s)]
*  I think he lost. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2410.8999999999996s)]
*  But it was 3-2. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2412.18s)]
*  And if there was one card that went the other way or one scoring [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2413.8599999999997s)]
*  that went the other way, then I would not be crazy upset about it. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2417.7s)]
*  But I think they got the decision right. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2421.14s)]
*  The other fight, you said he fought at 125? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2422.58s)]
*  He fought 125 pounds. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2424.5s)]
*  What does he come in weighing at? [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2425.4599999999996s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2427.22s)]
*  Because I'm like, 125? [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2428.3399999999997s)]
*  I could take that. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2429.54s)]
*  I mean, yeah. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2430.8199999999997s)]
*  How? [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2431.2999999999997s)]
*  Like, I could take 125 pounds. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2431.7s)]
*  The last week of my life is based on that principle. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2434.3399999999997s)]
*  You know? [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2436.74s)]
*  But I'm watching this shit. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2438.74s)]
*  Like, I'm going to have to rethink this shit. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2439.7s)]
*  How much kung fu does a motherfucker know? [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2441.62s)]
*  So yeah, it was crazy. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2445.4599999999996s)]
*  What do you think of the Seryl Ghan decision? [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2447.7s)]
*  Horrible. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2449.54s)]
*  Yeah, I saw Dana go and apologize to Volkov. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2450.2599999999998s)]
*  Like, it was so horrible. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2452.5s)]
*  I mean, Seryl Ghan just got worked. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2454.3399999999997s)]
*  He got his ass kicked. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2455.62s)]
*  And I think, yeah, it was just apparently he broke his every toe [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2456.58s)]
*  and one of his feet in the first round or something like that. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2460.66s)]
*  But Volkov, I thought, fought a way better fight. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2462.8199999999997s)]
*  He kind of like laid on him the last few rounds, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2465.22s)]
*  the last round of it. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2467.14s)]
*  And so you could go, he didn't really deliver the decision. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2468.5s)]
*  But it was easy. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2472.74s)]
*  Like, I don't think anybody that watched that fight with eyeballs [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2473.4599999999996s)]
*  thought that those judges got it right. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2475.7799999999997s)]
*  Like, I couldn't believe it. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2477.22s)]
*  There's no way that the judges that judge the rest of the fights [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2478.2599999999998s)]
*  that I thought they judged well judge that one. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2480.58s)]
*  And the fact that Dana gets so upset about it, it's nice. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2483.7s)]
*  Because in boxing, I would look at this and I go, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2486.66s)]
*  ah, the promoter rigged this whole shit. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2491.14s)]
*  But Dana coming out and going like, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2493.8599999999997s)]
*  I'm going to see if we can reverse that. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2495.4599999999996s)]
*  That was one of the worst decisions I've ever made. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2496.74s)]
*  Makes me feel like the judges are neutral. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2498.8199999999997s)]
*  But it's an interesting one too, where it's like, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2503.14s)]
*  can an organization reverse a scoring? [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2504.8999999999996s)]
*  And if they do, what's the precedent for that? [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2508.2599999999998s)]
*  Do you go back? [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2510.1s)]
*  That almost feels more corrupt. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2511.4599999999996s)]
*  It does. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2512.66s)]
*  Because if that happens, then it's like every single, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2513.06s)]
*  everything, no, contest it, contest it, contest it. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2516.1s)]
*  Or it could be a smart play by Dana and be like, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2518.3399999999997s)]
*  this person's better for views. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2521.7799999999997s)]
*  But even though they took the L, I got to act like I, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2523.54s)]
*  the other person deserved it. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2526.42s)]
*  But nah, you're going to get the next one. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2527.62s)]
*  But even losses in UFC, you can still run those guys. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2529.54s)]
*  This loss is not going to hurt Gary at all. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2533.14s)]
*  I don't think it helps him because he would have [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2535.7s)]
*  got a title shed immediately afterwards. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2537.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, but I'm going to still watch him. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2538.8199999999997s)]
*  I think it qualified him and validated him in a way. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2541.14s)]
*  You're like, oh, he's not a prospect. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2543.46s)]
*  This guy's good. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2545.3799999999997s)]
*  Remember when Munoz took that fight last minute [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2547.2999999999997s)]
*  and got demolished? [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2549.14s)]
*  But you still were like, I will watch every fight this guy does. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2550.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2553.22s)]
*  Wait, which one was Munoz again? [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2553.54s)]
*  He took a fight against what's his name last minute [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2555.8599999999997s)]
*  and just like got battered for five rounds. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2558.18s)]
*  I like that you're not against O'Malley. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2560.1s)]
*  Not against O'Malley. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2561.4599999999996s)]
*  I think it might have been O'Malley. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2561.9399999999996s)]
*  Oh, I think they're thinking of a different guy. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2563.2999999999997s)]
*  I know the guy you're talking about. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2564.8199999999997s)]
*  Is that a Brazilian guy? [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2565.9399999999996s)]
*  I thought it was Munoz. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2567.7s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2568.9799999999996s)]
*  Wait, what was it? [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2569.2999999999997s)]
*  Moutinho. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2569.7799999999997s)]
*  Moutinho? [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2570.58s)]
*  Moutinho? [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2571.7s)]
*  My bad. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2572.4199999999996s)]
*  Doesn't matter. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2572.8999999999996s)]
*  Point is, if you show up and you ball out, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2573.8599999999997s)]
*  the UFC will reward it. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2577.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2578.8999999999996s)]
*  Anyway, y'all are going to stake. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2579.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2581.62s)]

*  And then the celebs started getting comfy, right? [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2930.08s)]
*  Because they saw, they're like, ooh, there's [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2933.48s)]
*  a trend in this direction. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2935.48s)]
*  Let's pile on. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2936.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2937.88s)]
*  The second I saw these cornball ass celebs try to pile on, [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2938.36s)]
*  Meek tried to pile on. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2941.12s)]
*  He's like, yeah, this is what they do. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2942.24s)]
*  He made fun of me. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2943.88s)]
*  Called me gay in his standup. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2944.6s)]
*  That shit was fucked up. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2945.7999999999997s)]
*  I got a tweet of Meek saying, that shit was funny, bro. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2947.4s)]
*  I like that. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2949.52s)]
*  That's the first time I ever laughed at being called gay. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2950.0s)]
*  Actually, he didn't say being called gay. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2952.36s)]
*  What did he say? [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2954.04s)]
*  He said, that's the first time I laughed at being gay. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2954.6s)]
*  I almost feel bad for him. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2956.88s)]
*  I almost didn't want to do that. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2958.04s)]
*  Because I'm like, poor Meek cannot help himself. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2959.36s)]
*  If anyone has a reason to be mad, you know what I mean? [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2961.1600000000003s)]
*  It's him. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2962.84s)]
*  He's just cooking him in that clip. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2963.4s)]
*  Anyway, so he and then Ice Cube's son [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2965.32s)]
*  tries to post some shit. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2968.92s)]
*  And I just put it right under it. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2970.4s)]
*  I'm like, why don't you look up Google, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2971.6800000000003s)]
*  no Vaseline by your dad. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2973.44s)]
*  And now he's in the comments explaining himself. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2975.64s)]
*  Well, technically, that was a joke. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2977.72s)]
*  It was a metaphor. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2979.6s)]
*  It wasn't a real thing that was actually going to happen. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2980.6s)]
*  I'm like, oh, oh, really? [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2982.8399999999997s)]
*  Is that it? [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2984.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2984.96s)]
*  He must not have heard it in a while. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2985.44s)]
*  Because those aren't all metaphors. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2987.08s)]
*  There's some. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2989.04s)]
*  There's some on that one. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2990.0s)]
*  MC Ren's dick tastes like the shit in Yeezy's ass or something. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2991.0s)]
*  Talking about sticking a broom up somebody's ass. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2994.4s)]
*  Like, how do you make that into a metaphor? [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2996.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2998.4s)]
*  The broom was actually really the oppression [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=2999.7999999999997s)]
*  that black people had to endure from the record industry. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3001.64s)]
*  No. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3004.08s)]
*  No, it was just crazy to see it happen. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3005.0s)]
*  And then to see people jumping on the narratives. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3007.28s)]
*  The only thing that annoyed me was that one [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3010.4s)]
*  that they tried to push out, DL and then I guess Jasmine Brand, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3012.76s)]
*  tried to push out. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3015.76s)]
*  Because they tried to make it seem like I was being a victim [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3016.68s)]
*  after what I said. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3018.76s)]
*  No. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3019.84s)]
*  They said that shit to me and you and Sharla. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3020.84s)]
*  And I was like, it's up then. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3024.12s)]
*  If y'all want to go there, we could go there. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3025.8s)]
*  And I promised that you're not comfortable there. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3027.8s)]
*  And the second I went there, what happened? [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3030.52s)]
*  This is too far. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3033.28s)]
*  You can't make jokes about. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3034.2s)]
*  Unless of course you're making them about people [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3036.24s)]
*  that we think it's funny. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3038.08s)]
*  Unless of course you're every TV show. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3040.48s)]
*  Unless of course it's like literally everything [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3042.48s)]
*  they brought up. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3044.3999999999996s)]
*  They brought up this clip of Cat Williams going, [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3045.24s)]
*  is never funny. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3046.8399999999997s)]
*  And then literally Friday after next, [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3048.24s)]
*  he's in a scene where he's about to get. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3049.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3051.3999999999996s)]
*  He's like, what'd you pee on me? [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3052.24s)]
*  And I posted that scene. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3054.3599999999997s)]
*  It's like, come on. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3055.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3056.04s)]
*  People can make jokes about things. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3057.7599999999998s)]
*  You can make jokes about things. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3059.56s)]

*  And so I can actually understand. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3065.7200000000003s)]
*  It's like, if you take a clip out of context [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3067.92s)]
*  and you're like, wait, this is a podcast. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3071.0800000000004s)]
*  These podcasts is usually serious. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3072.6800000000003s)]
*  You're just people around sitting and talking. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3074.1200000000003s)]
*  So if you actually take what you say as serious, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3076.1200000000003s)]
*  I can understand why people would get upset at it. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3079.0s)]
*  But it's like, once you realize this is a comedy podcast, [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3081.0s)]
*  you're a comedian and you're making jokes. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3084.76s)]

*  I don't find these funny, this is fucked up. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3146.92s)]

*  about a group of people, now we have a disagreement. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3150.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's like if you were to- [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3153.68s)]
*  The second you tell people to kill my friends, [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3154.52s)]
*  now we have an issue. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3158.12s)]
*  So you took it to violence and you tried to censor my art. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3159.84s)]
*  You did two no-nos from me. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3164.04s)]
*  And I reacted accordingly. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3166.2s)]
*  And we didn't play the victim by showing all of our DMs [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3167.8s)]
*  of the death threats and all that stuff. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3170.4s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3190.96s)]
*  It's the point of being so over the top [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3191.8s)]
*  is so on some level you understand we're all kidding. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3194.08s)]

*  That's so crazy that he would do that. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3220.84s)]
*  And you wore the jacket today in protest. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3222.8s)]
*  That is so crazy. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3224.68s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3233.2s)]
*  That's a reasonable insult, fuck. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3234.04s)]
*  Yeah, no, that was just crazy. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3237.16s)]
*  Just seeing them immediately turn into victims [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3238.7999999999997s)]
*  was just so corny. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3241.68s)]
*  The fact that they're protesting, listen, [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3242.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm gonna put this out as it's a fan, okay? [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3247.08s)]
*  I'm not gonna say it comes from Kendrick or his team [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3250.8399999999997s)]
*  or his publicist. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3254.8799999999997s)]
*  I'm gonna say that this is a random fan [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3255.7999999999997s)]
*  acting completely separately from them. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3258.0s)]
*  But basically, they put out an ad [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3260.2s)]
*  where they are paying protesters [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3262.92s)]
*  to show up to my Hawaii show, [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3265.08s)]
*  December 21st, take a link down there, you'll see it, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3267.68s)]
*  at the Blisdale Arena. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3270.88s)]
*  They're paying protesters. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3273.24s)]
*  Now, I don't know who's providing the money. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3276.08s)]
*  $250 is not nothing. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3278.68s)]
*  Low key, I'm almost like, should we all go [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3280.4s)]
*  and not just do a show outside? [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3282.64s)]
*  Sorry, if a thousand people show up, [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3284.36s)]
*  that's $250,000 you gotta pay. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3287.36s)]
*  So who's gonna pay that, who would have that kind of money? [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3288.7999999999997s)]
*  Probably a really obsessive fan. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3292.7599999999998s)]
*  Now, I'm not saying it's coming from their team. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3295.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm not saying it's coming from Kendrick. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3298.28s)]
*  But this is, and by the way, they're paying full, [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3299.92s)]
*  that's like full, that's not 30% off their streams. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3304.2000000000003s)]
*  This is a full price. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3306.96s)]
*  They're paying, imagine being an artist artist [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3309.08s)]
*  who really believes in creativity [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3314.56s)]
*  and in censoring other artists. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3316.92s)]
*  Now, I'm not saying it's Kendrick. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3318.88s)]
*  It's probably just a one random fan [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3320.2000000000003s)]
*  with millions and millions of dollars [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3322.2000000000003s)]
*  that he would like to deploy to protesting a show [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3324.12s)]
*  in Hawaii of mine. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3327.08s)]
*  Probably has nothing to do with the team [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3328.44s)]
*  freaking out and in shambles [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3330.4s)]
*  because they've never been made fun of on the internet. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3331.8399999999997s)]
*  And their only reactions go, you're racist. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3334.04s)]
*  Oh, you're so racist. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3337.7999999999997s)]
*  Because you wanna butt fuck my guy. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3340.4s)]
*  You know what hurt me the most? [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3342.56s)]
*  What is it? [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3343.4s)]
*  You said Kendrick made music for Dudes Under 5'10 [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3344.24s)]
*  and he's my number one artist on Spotify, right? [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3346.44s)]
*  He does, he does make music for Dudes Under 5'10. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3349.16s)]
*  And number one and two songs. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3352.6s)]
*  That's what hurt me the most personally. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3354.36s)]
*  I took that as like painfully true. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3355.84s)]
*  He does make good music. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3357.92s)]
*  You need to stop wearing lifts. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3358.76s)]
*  Yes, right? [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3360.2000000000003s)]
*  He was my number one artist. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3362.04s)]
*  Now, he's 16. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3364.88s)]
*  He was all about the six god. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3365.7200000000003s)]
*  But no, I think it is like, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3370.2400000000002s)]

*  Short King Kendrick, no? [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3407.12s)]
*  Short King Kendrick. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3408.32s)]
*  It's that energy. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3409.96s)]
*  It's why there's a protest out of the show. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3410.88s)]

*  Just tell your fans about this [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3418.24s)]
*  and have everybody who's showing up to the show get paid. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3420.44s)]
*  Bro, that's what I wanted. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3424.56s)]
*  That's what you shouldn't do. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3425.4s)]
*  That and then just drain the bank account. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3426.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3427.8s)]
*  The prob, there's one problem. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3428.64s)]
*  So this is what I wanted to do. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3429.68s)]
*  I was like, yo, let's all just go get paid. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3430.7599999999998s)]
*  But then it's, [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3433.08s)]
*  this is so fucking funny. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3435.16s)]
*  The protest is a minimum requirement of four hours. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3436.64s)]
*  So you can't even just protest regular. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3441.16s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta find a way to broadcast the hour outside. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3444.3199999999997s)]
*  Once the show sells, once tickets sell out, [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3448.0s)]
*  if tickets sell out, once you buy a spot, [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3451.64s)]
*  then we'll find a way to broadcast it outside. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3453.72s)]
*  And then everybody just gets to pay $250 to go to a show. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3455.72s)]
*  I mean, that would be good, [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3458.68s)]
*  but then they're just gonna post it all over the internet. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3460.0s)]
*  And that's the... [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3462.2s)]
*  Oh, fuck me dude. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3463.04s)]
*  That's okay, that was that Punjabi brand coming out. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3464.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3466.0s)]
*  It's okay, get that Hindu, get that Hindu, get that Hindu. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3467.28s)]
*  Get that Hindu, guys. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3470.28s)]
*  Shout out to Punjabis, we love you. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3471.72s)]
*  Delay the show and you gotta go for four hours. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3473.52s)]
*  Trust is Luigi Mangione. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3475.44s)]
*  That's what you should do. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3476.96s)]

*  You need a burger and you're right in the ass. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3483.08s)]
*  I didn't realize the four hour thing. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3485.0s)]
*  Nah, they were so hard at that. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3486.68s)]
*  But you know, the idea of paying people to protest. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3487.72s)]
*  But also, you're gonna be in Hawaii. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3490.48s)]
*  I don't know what Hawaiian is gonna spend [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3493.72s)]
*  four hours being mad. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3495.2s)]
*  Yo, first of all, Hawaiians don't give a... [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3496.3999999999996s)]
*  Let me tell you something about Hawaiians. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3498.0s)]

*  Hawaiians do not take kindly to outsiders [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3501.8799999999997s)]
*  telling them what they can or can't do. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3504.8399999999997s)]
*  Okay? [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3507.2799999999997s)]
*  Hawaiians don't give a fuck what no outsider [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3508.12s)]
*  tells them what they can or can't laugh at, [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3510.7599999999998s)]
*  what they can or can't joke around about that. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3512.92s)]
*  Hawaiians do what Hawaiians fucking do. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3515.04s)]
*  So I, yeah, you could try to tell Hawaiians [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3517.48s)]
*  what to do all you want. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3520.3199999999997s)]

*  I promise you that. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3524.2s)]
*  Hawaii's the only place where they're openly [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3525.52s)]
*  just call people from America. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3527.12s)]

*  Like openly, and then we just all go along with it. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3534.16s)]
*  They don't give a fuck. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3536.44s)]
*  And also they're like, oh, it's a racist comedy show. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3537.96s)]
*  Hawaiians look at that, they're like, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3541.0s)]
*  ooh, I can't, where to take this? [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3542.2s)]
*  This is gonna be fun. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3544.44s)]
*  They have immense comfort with race-based humor. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3546.3999999999996s)]
*  There's so many different people there. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3549.3199999999997s)]
*  And the way that they can, I guess, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3551.68s)]
*  come together culturally is making fun of each other. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3553.8399999999997s)]

*  All right guys, let's take a break for a second, man, [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3640.52s)]
*  because I need to help you organize your business. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3642.04s)]
*  I need to help you save some money. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3643.6800000000003s)]
*  And I'm gonna do that by talking to you guys about Odoo. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3645.52s)]
*  Odoo is an all-in-one platform that combines practically [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3648.48s)]
*  every single tool that you could pay for [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3651.4s)]
*  as a business under one roof. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3654.16s)]
*  You're gonna be paying for these things [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3656.2000000000003s)]
*  as your business grows, guaranteed. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3657.48s)]
*  You're gonna go a la carte, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3659.08s)]
*  where you select each individual dual service, [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3660.96s)]
*  or you're gonna go with Odoo, [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3662.92s)]
*  a one-stop shop for all of it. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3664.6s)]
*  This is the no-brainer. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3667.16s)]
*  This is a genius idea. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3668.44s)]
*  You're gonna save hundreds, maybe thousands of dollars [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3669.96s)]
*  by making the switch to Odoo. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3672.96s)]
*  They have a time-tracking platform [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3674.52s)]
*  so employees can track their hours that they've worked. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3676.52s)]
*  They have an accounting platform to replace QuickBooks. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3679.16s)]
*  They have invoicing and much more. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3681.8399999999997s)]
*  And the plans start for as low as $24.90 per month per user. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3684.12s)]
*  So think about it. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3688.12s)]
*  DocuSign, right? [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3689.04s)]
*  We all use DocuSign. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3690.6s)]
*  That's where you're gonna sign your documents. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=3691.52s)]

*  probably hasn't been able to curse, [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4226.8s)]
*  hasn't been able to say things. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4228.040000000001s)]
*  Every rapper that's performed has words they can't say. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4229.400000000001s)]
*  But if you're gonna play the song [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4231.280000000001s)]
*  that is about calling a dude a pedophile [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4233.200000000001s)]
*  and then you don't call him a pedophile, [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4235.0s)]
*  seems a little. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4237.200000000001s)]
*  It's a beef, it's not a normal, [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4238.240000000001s)]
*  this is the craziest hit that is a beef song, [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4240.4800000000005s)]
*  even more than Back to Back, I think. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4243.6s)]
*  It's his biggest song by far. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4245.6s)]
*  So if you go there, you gotta do that song, it's your hit, [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4247.04s)]
*  but it is also a beef song, [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4250.48s)]
*  so taking the beef out of it, now what is it? [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4251.72s)]
*  It's not the same song. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4254.08s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4255.28s)]
*  Most rap songs, you can take out the cuss words [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4256.36s)]
*  and it's the same song. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4258.08s)]
*  This one, you can't take out the Drake disses [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4258.92s)]
*  and it'd still be the same song. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4261.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4263.0s)]
*  Like I said, I feel like he's gonna say it [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4264.16s)]
*  and I think they'll just mute it in the broadcast. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4266.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's on a delay probably, right? [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4267.72s)]
*  Probably his best move is to tell the NFL, [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4269.56s)]
*  this is getting said, get your mute button ready. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4271.24s)]
*  I think, and I would respect the fuck out of that, low key. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4273.44s)]
*  I would respect the fuck out of that. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4277.68s)]
*  Stand by your art, say whatever the fuck you want. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4278.6s)]
*  I would respect the high key, five seven, I love him. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4280.64s)]
*  I love this guy, I love this guy. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4283.08s)]
*  The number one artist. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4285.72s)]
*  Honestly, you kind of freed me up to say I love him [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4286.56s)]
*  when you said that. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4288.360000000001s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with loving, you should love him, [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4289.2s)]
*  he's for you. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4290.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's my guy. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4291.88s)]
*  He's your chapel rome. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4293.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4294.64s)]
*  Like we're sure dudes, listen to Kendrick, [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4295.4800000000005s)]
*  they're doing that, H-O-T-T-O-G-O. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4297.8s)]
*  D-O-P-H-I-O-E. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4301.28s)]
*  No? [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4304.68s)]
*  I was like, I think I have to spell that shit. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4305.68s)]
*  I was thinking, I was like, how do you even spell it? [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4308.56s)]
*  Fucking damn, Mark. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4310.72s)]
*  I think he can say it. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4313.040000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, is it against the broadcast rules? [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4315.080000000001s)]
*  We're reading all these FCC rules [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4317.120000000001s)]
*  and it doesn't seem like he's not allowed to say it. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4318.400000000001s)]
*  No, it's not whether it breaks the rule, [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4320.040000000001s)]
*  it's whether you want that word screamed out. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4321.84s)]
*  If the NFL wants to deal with that. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4323.92s)]
*  Dr. Dre. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4325.68s)]
*  So Dr. Dre admitted that the NFL did request minor changes [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4327.0s)]
*  and I think that. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4330.0s)]
*  Get it? [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4330.84s)]
*  Dude. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4331.68s)]
*  Well, catch it. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4332.52s)]
*  He's back. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4333.4400000000005s)]
*  The 2022 show, Kendrick Lamar's all right to line and weed. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4336.4800000000005s)]
*  I won't even say all the lines. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4340.76s)]
*  He admitted a couple things. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4342.6s)]
*  Lamar admitted popo. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4344.96s)]
*  Popo? [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4348.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh wow, he couldn't even say that. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4349.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, dog, come on, this is the NFL. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4351.0s)]
*  Oh, he's not saying a minor, he's not saying nothing. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4352.4400000000005s)]
*  What if he doesn't do the song? [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4355.160000000001s)]
*  Now, if he doesn't do the song, that's a point to Drake. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4357.0s)]
*  Or is it like, I'm not even gonna make it about you. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4360.0s)]
*  If he avoids the whole song. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4361.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4363.68s)]
*  That's a point to Drake. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4365.56s)]
*  It's either Drake made it happen [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4367.04s)]
*  or you weren't really willing to stand up for your art. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4369.84s)]
*  Because if I'm not mistaken, [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4372.92s)]
*  Eminem said I'm not doing a Super Bowl [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4376.16s)]
*  unless 50 is gonna be there. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4377.64s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4380.72s)]
*  Stood up for his art. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4381.56s)]
*  He's like, I need him to be there. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4383.04s)]
*  This is an important moment [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4384.4800000000005s)]
*  and I need him to be part of this. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4385.72s)]
*  Stood up for it. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4387.52s)]
*  I would rather not do it. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4388.96s)]
*  I'd rather not do it if he's not gonna be there. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4391.08s)]
*  You're gonna not do your most popular song [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4395.64s)]
*  in the height of its popularity at the fucking Super Bowl? [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4397.6s)]
*  Nah, bro, you gotta do it. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4401.4800000000005s)]
*  He does have to. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4403.88s)]
*  Yeah, there were gang references [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4404.72s)]
*  that were ass-bombed from Kendrick's performances. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4405.8s)]
*  And the Po-Po thing, probably the NFL was like, [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4408.88s)]
*  dog, the Colin Kaepernick shit is still fresh [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4410.64s)]
*  on everybody's mind, I don't want it. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4412.4800000000005s)]
*  And to him, it's probably like, I don't care that much. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4414.0s)]
*  I'm doing one song, but if it's my performance, [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4417.04s)]
*  I have to do the song, I think he does the song. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4419.64s)]
*  And either he says, I think, like PDF file or something, [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4421.88s)]
*  or what you said, which is, I'm NFL, I'm saying it, [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4425.04s)]
*  get ready to dump it. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4428.76s)]
*  That's just what it is. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4429.72s)]
*  I think that's the smartest way to do it. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4430.64s)]
*  That's by far. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4432.88s)]
*  And then what's gonna happen is they'll dump him saying it, [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4434.0s)]
*  but the crowd will say it. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4436.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4438.400000000001s)]
*  And then you get the best of both worlds. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4439.24s)]
*  Or yeah, what if he could do certified, [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4440.84s)]
*  Loverboy certified. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4443.24s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4444.56s)]
*  Yeah, he kept doing it, I was like, yeah. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4445.400000000001s)]
*  That's fire. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4446.24s)]
*  That's fire. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4447.08s)]
*  Oh boy. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4447.92s)]
*  That would be a good workaround. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4448.74s)]
*  That's not good. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4449.58s)]
*  50 posted and he said, what's going on? [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4450.46s)]
*  Are we still gonna even have the Super Bowl? [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4452.9800000000005s)]
*  What did Jay do to 50? [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4454.9800000000005s)]
*  Did you remember? [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4458.9800000000005s)]
*  I love it, I love it. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4459.82s)]
*  Whatever video that is. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4461.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, why don't they get along? [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4462.78s)]
*  Because I know back in the day, they didn't get along. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4465.14s)]
*  Like 50, Jay had a line for 50 in one of his earlier. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4468.66s)]
*  But that was a response to 50 going at Jay, right? [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4473.1s)]
*  On how to rock? [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4475.42s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4476.26s)]
*  I'm sure some behind the scenes shit has happened. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4478.58s)]
*  And also ego. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4481.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Jay probably didn't forget that as 50 came up. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4482.62s)]
*  So do you think the Jay Z thing just gets thrown out? [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4486.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4488.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4489.46s)]
*  Nothing comes of it? [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4490.3s)]

*  He's innocent, bro. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4491.96s)]
*  Until proven guilty. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4492.8s)]
*  He's innocent. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4493.62s)]
*  And this is America. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4494.46s)]
*  You said it like it was gonna happen. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4495.3s)]
*  You said until proven guilty like it was gonna happen. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4497.179999999999s)]
*  If proven guilty. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4499.46s)]
*  Until proven guilty. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4500.5s)]
*  I hate the, like. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4502.179999999999s)]
*  Shut up. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4504.54s)]
*  What is the, what are they basically saying? [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4505.38s)]
*  The allegations are that she was 13 trying to get [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4507.740000000001s)]
*  into the Radio City show or something like that. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4510.42s)]
*  VMAs. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4513.02s)]
*  What was that? [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4513.860000000001s)]
*  VMAs after party. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4514.700000000001s)]
*  VMAs after party. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4515.580000000001s)]
*  But she's trying to get the VMAs, yeah, then. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4516.42s)]
*  The VMAs are I think at Radio City. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4517.740000000001s)]
*  And then she was trying to get into the after party [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4519.42s)]
*  and then she was driven around. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4521.3s)]
*  And then there's like the stories getting a little wonky. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4522.900000000001s)]
*  It's also happened how long ago? [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4525.820000000001s)]
*  Like 20 years ago? [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4527.34s)]
*  I think it was 2000. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4529.22s)]
*  Like I don't know, bro. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4530.54s)]
*  24 years ago, that's crazy. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4531.38s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4532.620000000001s)]
*  The allegations, Al, you are a rider god, bro. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4534.26s)]
*  You gotta respect. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4538.02s)]
*  You gotta respect. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4538.860000000001s)]
*  No, no, no, but I wanna say. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4539.7s)]
*  No comment. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4540.54s)]
*  I wanna say it's like, I hate the idea [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4541.38s)]
*  that just allegations can go automatically [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4543.38s)]
*  incriminate people. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4545.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4546.22s)]
*  Yeah, I think the allegations shit is corny. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4547.06s)]
*  But I also think we're moving away from a time [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4548.46s)]
*  where an allegation is a conviction. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4550.62s)]
*  There was a time during Me Too where it was just [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4552.58s)]
*  the second you said something, it's over. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4554.58s)]
*  And I think now there's been so many things said [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4556.58s)]
*  that people just do not give a fuck about. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4559.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4561.740000000001s)]
*  That we're like, oh. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4562.58s)]
*  Arr, Me Too now. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4563.46s)]
*  We're just a little late to the party. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4564.3s)]
*  What a surprise. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4566.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4568.06s)]
*  Nah, but real talk. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4568.9s)]
*  But do you know what I'm saying? [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4570.74s)]
*  I don't like that for a civil case, [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4571.58s)]
*  you can still be John Doe, Jane Doe, whatever. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4575.1s)]
*  Ooh. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4578.58s)]
*  I don't like that. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4579.42s)]
*  Can you break that down to people, [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4580.26s)]
*  the difference between a civil case and a criminal? [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4582.58s)]
*  So, criminal, Tay, you get charged for a crime [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4584.38s)]
*  and my justice is you going to jail for. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4587.7s)]
*  Civil is like, hey, I'm just suing for damages [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4591.26s)]
*  and usually it's a monetary payout. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4593.900000000001s)]
*  And it's like, I think, hey. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4596.14s)]
*  But it's for the same, it's for the same act. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4597.7s)]
*  Yeah, for the same act. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4601.54s)]
*  You've been wronged by that person [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4602.38s)]
*  and you're not gonna go to jail, [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4603.780000000001s)]
*  but I want you to pay me for what you've done [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4605.06s)]
*  to do the pain. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4607.02s)]
*  And to be guilty for a criminal, [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4607.860000000001s)]
*  it's beyond reasonable doubt. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4609.46s)]
*  For civil, you only have to have just a suspicion, [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4611.02s)]
*  at least 51% you feel like. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4614.780000000001s)]
*  It's a much easier conviction for civil. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4616.3s)]
*  That's like, OJ I think was convicted for civil. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4618.9400000000005s)]
*  But not for criminal. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4622.14s)]
*  And so I don't think that you should be able [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4623.14s)]
*  to just file a civil lawsuit, [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4625.06s)]
*  but then not identify yourself. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4627.780000000001s)]
*  And break that down. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4630.46s)]
*  Tell me more. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4631.46s)]
*  Because it's like, the damage is already done with, [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4632.3s)]
*  well, I wouldn't say done, [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4634.34s)]
*  but this is already hurting Jay-Z [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4635.700000000001s)]
*  just by making the accusation. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4637.820000000001s)]
*  And it's like, this person doesn't want him to seek justice. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4639.9800000000005s)]
*  You don't want him to go to jail. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4644.18s)]
*  You just want a payout. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4645.900000000001s)]
*  So it's like, hey, if you want a payout [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4646.900000000001s)]
*  and that's gonna make you feel better, [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4648.5s)]
*  then at least you should have to say your name. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4649.86s)]
*  So this is really interesting. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4652.74s)]
*  Because I've thought this about even criminal, [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4654.66s)]
*  but the idea is that if there are women, for example, [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4657.54s)]
*  that are victims of sexual assault, [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4661.139999999999s)]
*  they what, fear for their life if they're coming out, [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4664.259999999999s)]
*  that they could be attacked. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4667.0599999999995s)]
*  Coming out against somebody with a lot of fans. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4668.259999999999s)]
*  With a lot of power and fame. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4670.0599999999995s)]
*  Like, isn't their name out there? [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4671.74s)]
*  Rabid fans can just be hitting them up, [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4673.78s)]
*  threatening them, fuck you, you're slut, whatever. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4675.86s)]
*  Maybe physical violence, they're out there. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4678.34s)]
*  And now you can dock somebody fairly easily. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4680.82s)]
*  Anybody can sue another person. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4683.26s)]
*  And it's like, the damage for Jay-Z is happening right now. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4685.46s)]
*  But a sexual assault is different than a lawsuit. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4688.78s)]
*  It's very odd that we're on such, [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4690.54s)]
*  well, really flipped on this. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4692.46s)]
*  You're the guy that wants to pay government employees [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4694.38s)]
*  who do nothing for two years, [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4696.06s)]
*  but if a girl potentially gets hit by somebody, [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4697.14s)]
*  you're like, say the name. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4699.7s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4701.3s)]
*  He's saying criminally, you should hide the name. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4702.42s)]
*  But for civil, if you're just asking for monetary gain, [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4705.06s)]
*  I still see how, again, if you are coming at a Jay-Z [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4709.3s)]
*  or a Diddy or a fucking Tom Brady, not to say anything, [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4711.9400000000005s)]
*  but like people that are super famous, [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4715.22s)]
*  there are super fans who are insane. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4717.5s)]
*  Once your name is out there, they can get the address, [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4719.54s)]
*  they can get your family's address. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4721.5s)]
*  They can do anything they want to, [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4722.860000000001s)]
*  because you are coming at my god. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4723.9400000000005s)]
*  It doesn't matter who the artist is. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4727.14s)]
*  If they are famous, there are repercussions [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4728.7s)]
*  that could come with that that you do not deserve. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4731.54s)]
*  Even... [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4734.22s)]
*  I get your point, but I'm saying is for justice, [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4736.3s)]
*  criminal justice, meaning you go to jail [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4739.26s)]
*  for committing the crime, you get to hide your identity. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4741.3s)]
*  For profit, to make money off of the circumstances, [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4744.14s)]
*  the horrible circumstances that you were in, [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4747.74s)]
*  you can hide your name. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4750.34s)]
*  That's the idea. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4751.5s)]
*  So you don't hide your name. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4752.74s)]
*  That's what Al's saying. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4753.86s)]
*  If you're trying to make money, [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4754.7s)]
*  we should know who's trying to make money [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4755.74s)]
*  off of this situation. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4757.0s)]
*  Well, I think also... [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=4757.9800000000005s)]

*  I'm like, what is this? [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5285.62s)]
*  That was funny. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5289.62s)]

*  Oh, man. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5295.099999999999s)]
*  All right, guys, we're gonna take a break real quick [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5297.7s)]
*  because we gotta talk about Morgan and Morgan. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5299.62s)]
*  And hopefully this doesn't apply to you. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5301.5s)]
*  Hopefully this never applies. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5302.82s)]
*  But sometimes you get injured [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5304.34s)]
*  because of the malevolence, maliciousness, [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5306.22s)]
*  or negligence of another human being. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5309.74s)]
*  And that shit sucks. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5312.139999999999s)]
*  You gotta deal with health insurance companies. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5313.419999999999s)]
*  You can't just shoot out CEOs apparently. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5314.9s)]
*  I thought that'd be fire, but you can't do that. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5316.54s)]
*  You gotta deal with the pain, [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5318.58s)]
*  the medical bills that are piling up. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5320.74s)]
*  And again, you can't shoot the CEOs [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5322.419999999999s)]
*  as much as you want to. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5323.78s)]
*  So it all sucks. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5324.94s)]
*  It's all difficult. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5326.259999999999s)]
*  But you know what's easy? [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5327.099999999999s)]
*  Filing a claim with Morgan and Morgan. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5327.919999999999s)]
*  Morgan and Morgan is America's largest injury law firm. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5329.58s)]
*  They have recovered over $15 billion [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5332.339999999999s)]
*  for over 300,000 clients. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5335.139999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna be honest, [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5336.66s)]
*  I think that number's gone up by now. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5337.5s)]
*  This copy might be old. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5338.7s)]
*  I read 20 billion somewhere. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5340.0599999999995s)]
*  I don't know where, but 20 billion. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5341.42s)]
*  And for hundreds of thousands of clients. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5343.06s)]
*  So it's not like they won $15 billion case [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5344.9400000000005s)]
*  and then they fucked everybody else over. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5347.22s)]
*  Morgan and Morgan has been fighting for the people [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5349.06s)]
*  for over 35 years. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5351.26s)]
*  So again, if you get injured [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5352.38s)]
*  because somebody else is negligence, that's hard. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5353.9400000000005s)]
*  But submitting a claim to Morgan and Morgan is easy. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5358.14s)]
*  If you're ever injured, you can check out Morgan and Morgan. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5360.42s)]
*  Their fee is free unless they win. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5362.42s)]
*  That is important and worth repeating. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5364.24s)]

*  It's always great when you gotta explain it. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5686.0s)]
*  Yes, my dad married her when she was 21. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5687.32s)]
*  So, there you go. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5690.72s)]
*  Less hope is 21. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5691.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5693.24s)]
*  Next year it's gonna be- [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5694.08s)]
*  425. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5694.92s)]
*  It's gonna be something different. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5695.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5696.6s)]
*  Anywho, so- [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5697.44s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like he had a little bit of a [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5699.32s)]
*  criminal history. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5701.0s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5701.96s)]
*  No, he's a crazy person. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5702.8s)]
*  This is a shame. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5704.08s)]
*  It's a shame that they're crazy. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5704.92s)]
*  It's a shame that we don't have a system to help them [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5706.12s)]
*  because essentially what happens is when they commit a crime [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5709.24s)]
*  and they're crazy, they go to the psych ward for like a week, [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5711.0s)]
*  they put them on some meds, [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5713.08s)]
*  they can force them on the meds [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5714.04s)]
*  while they're on the psych ward, [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5715.16s)]
*  and then they go back out to the street [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5716.24s)]
*  and the same thing happens. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5717.48s)]
*  That is tragic. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5718.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5719.28s)]
*  That's fucked up and we just don't have a support system [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5720.12s)]
*  for it. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5722.5599999999995s)]
*  It's fucked up that cops gotta deal with it. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5723.4s)]
*  Cops are here to stop people from committing crimes. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5725.08s)]
*  They're not here to do therapy. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5727.04s)]
*  And a lot of times cops had to deal with psychotic people, [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5728.24s)]
*  which it shouldn't be them. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5731.5599999999995s)]
*  There should be a unit of people who deal with mental [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5732.68s)]
*  illness, but that doesn't happen. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5734.5199999999995s)]
*  So it sucks. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5736.48s)]
*  This does suck. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5737.32s)]
*  But that guy on the subway, the Daniel Penny guy, [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5738.16s)]
*  doesn't know this guy's history. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5740.8s)]
*  No. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5742.32s)]
*  He just sees somebody- [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5743.16s)]
*  Acting erratic. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5744.0s)]
*  Acting erratic people. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5745.400000000001s)]
*  So he steps in and does what he thinks [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5746.64s)]
*  is the right thing to do, which is subdue that guy. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5749.360000000001s)]
*  Puts him into a choke hold. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5751.28s)]
*  And then this person- [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5752.88s)]
*  For eight minutes. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5754.28s)]
*  Unfortunately dies. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5755.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5756.88s)]
*  And then he's never- [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5757.72s)]
*  They could be choke anything for eight minutes. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5759.2s)]
*  Well, hold on, hold on. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5761.52s)]
*  What's the amount of minutes? [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5763.6s)]
*  You know? [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5765.92s)]
*  Eight might be the minutes. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5766.76s)]
*  We know the allegations. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5767.6s)]
*  Eight might be the minutes. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5769.360000000001s)]
*  We need to know the amount of minutes. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5770.4800000000005s)]
*  Eight is the number. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5771.88s)]
*  Eight is the number. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5772.72s)]
*  George Floyd, what was that? [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5774.52s)]
*  I think it was nine or something. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5776.64s)]
*  So is that the amount of minutes where we start going, [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5778.04s)]
*  whoa, that's a little too long? [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5780.2s)]
*  One minute. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5782.0s)]
*  One minute. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5782.84s)]
*  Wipe it away. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5783.68s)]
*  You gotta choke someone for a minute. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5784.52s)]
*  That's just a UFC match. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5785.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5786.92s)]
*  Stop, did he tap? [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5787.76s)]
*  Two, two minutes. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5789.12s)]
*  Two minutes, you're like, [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5789.96s)]
*  well, maybe he was wriggling a little bit [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5791.04s)]
*  and you weren't choking him the whole time. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5792.52s)]
*  Three minutes? [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5794.84s)]
*  Three minutes to body ain't wiggling. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5795.68s)]
*  Three minutes to body's not wiggling, [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5797.72s)]
*  but he could be faking sleep and then come back [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5799.04s)]
*  and go back to assaulting, [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5801.52s)]
*  so you need to keep him in there for three minutes. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5802.44s)]
*  Four minutes? [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5804.759999999999s)]
*  So he's playing possum. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5805.879999999999s)]
*  Now we're getting into a he might be dead situation. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5806.839999999999s)]
*  He might be actually dead. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5810.639999999999s)]
*  You can do that thing. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5812.5199999999995s)]
*  Not four minutes are good. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5813.36s)]
*  Lift a hand if he falls. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5814.2s)]
*  Three of those match over. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5815.44s)]
*  So then that happened and then four more minutes happened [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5816.759999999999s)]
*  just to make sure. Five minutes, [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5819.12s)]
*  that's fucked up. He wasn't. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5820.28s)]
*  Six minutes, that's fucked up. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5821.4s)]
*  Seven minutes. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5822.719999999999s)]
*  Lucky. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5824.08s)]
*  Too lucky, can't do it. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5824.919999999999s)]
*  You gotta let go at seven though, [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5826.4s)]
*  because that's where you stop, now he can breathe again. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5827.639999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5829.2s)]
*  Eight minutes. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5830.72s)]
*  Fucked up. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5831.6s)]
*  So you're saying this guy's guilty? [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5833.08s)]
*  Well, guilty of what? [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5835.8s)]
*  I would give him manslaughter. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5837.240000000001s)]
*  He didn't intentionally try to kill the guy, but he did. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5838.280000000001s)]
*  You ever been harassed on the subway, bro? [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5841.200000000001s)]
*  You never had like a mariachi band or something like that [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5842.8s)]
*  come onto your thing while you're trying to listen [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5845.4800000000005s)]
*  to a podcast? [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5847.16s)]
*  I never wanted to kill him, [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5848.0s)]
*  just like throw pennies at him. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5848.84s)]
*  That ain't my question. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5851.4800000000005s)]
*  How many times he been on the subway? [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5852.56s)]
*  Oh gosh, you can check your mic. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5854.400000000001s)]
*  For everybody else, this shit is, we seen this. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5855.4800000000005s)]
*  Crazy person on the subway, you just go to the next train. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5857.72s)]
*  That's why you know he's a transplant. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5859.84s)]
*  Transplants can't, they don't know how New York operates [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5861.84s)]
*  and he overreacted. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5865.4800000000005s)]
*  So what you're saying is only New Yorkers [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5867.08s)]
*  can kill their homeless? [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5868.56s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5869.400000000001s)]
*  Now, if that person was hitting your mom, [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5870.96s)]
*  would you have done what Daniel Penny did? [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5876.4400000000005s)]
*  Damn, I wanted to see what she'd do. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5878.2s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5880.0s)]
*  It's my mom, I can't do that. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5880.84s)]
*  I can't do that. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5882.76s)]
*  With that, it would have been funny. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5884.16s)]
*  What if you punch him in the nose, [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5885.0s)]
*  break a nose and an orbital bone? [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5885.84s)]
*  That seems just, that seems all right. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5887.72s)]
*  Just beat his ass. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5890.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I just, I understand. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5891.92s)]
*  He just wanted to protect, subdue him. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5893.92s)]
*  Yes, I get that. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5896.52s)]
*  It just seems, eight minutes does seem like a long ass time. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5897.360000000001s)]
*  Also, I think what they're saying is that he actually died [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5899.200000000001s)]
*  from, it's one of those. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5901.68s)]

*  That's the defense. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5904.200000000001s)]
*  Like, oh, all this other stuff in his system, [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5905.04s)]
*  but come on, guys. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5907.200000000001s)]
*  They're saying he had a faint pulse [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5908.120000000001s)]
*  when they first got to him and then they hit him [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5909.92s)]
*  with Narcan and then he was pronounced dead after. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5911.4400000000005s)]
*  So they killed him. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5913.68s)]
*  Well, that was literally one of the defenses. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5915.160000000001s)]
*  Of course the cops would kill another minority. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5918.12s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5920.0s)]
*  Damn, this motherfucker held his breath for eight minutes. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5920.84s)]
*  Of course. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5923.36s)]
*  But I think according to what I read earlier, [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5924.2s)]
*  I got a double check. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5926.5599999999995s)]
*  I think he swam here, bro. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5927.4s)]
*  This is a film. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5928.64s)]
*  He's black, he's. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5929.96s)]
*  Oh, I thought he was Puerto Rican. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5932.04s)]
*  I thought he was Latino. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5933.0s)]
*  He's black. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5933.84s)]
*  What's his name? [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5934.66s)]
*  Jordan Neely. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5935.5s)]
*  Oh yeah, Jordan Neely, yeah. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5936.34s)]
*  Oh. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5937.16s)]
*  That's a black man, bro. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5938.0s)]
*  You think this would be a news story [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5939.68s)]
*  if he was Puerto Rican? [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5940.76s)]
*  Come on. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5941.6s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5942.44s)]
*  But apparently. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5943.48s)]
*  They've been like, yo, it's a migrant. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5944.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5945.36s)]
*  I think in court they testify that he let go [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5946.2s)]
*  45 seconds after he had gone limp. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5949.04s)]
*  So he was sort of moving, [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5950.68s)]
*  and then by the time he was limp, [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5952.32s)]
*  he let go 45 seconds later. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5953.96s)]
*  As what I read earlier today. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5955.8s)]
*  I need to know what he was doing. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5957.48s)]
*  Immediately after the limp. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5959.12s)]
*  Not held. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5960.64s)]
*  I need to know what he was doing [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5961.48s)]
*  to the people on the subway. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5962.32s)]
*  Because that's what matters. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5963.6s)]
*  Some people were saying he was threatening, [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5964.92s)]
*  some people were saying he wasn't. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5966.22s)]
*  He was getting in some woman's face with kids. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5967.24s)]
*  Yeah, he walked on the train. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5969.08s)]
*  Dreatening a woman with children. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5970.64s)]
*  He was getting in their face. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5972.04s)]
*  I mean, yeah. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5973.2s)]
*  But that's the thing, you have people on the same train [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5974.0199999999995s)]
*  saying two different things. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5976.04s)]
*  Because to me, that's the only thing that matters. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5978.12s)]
*  If you're threatening a woman with children, [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5980.16s)]
*  and if my wife with our baby is on the subway, [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5981.88s)]
*  and there's a crazy person threatening her, [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5984.96s)]
*  and she is locked in the subway, [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5986.74s)]
*  cannot control herself, cannot leave our baby, [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5987.96s)]
*  because to defend herself against a man, [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5990.64s)]
*  and another dude comes and steps in, [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5993.72s)]
*  and fucking chokes that guy out. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=5996.08s)]
*  I gotta dap him up or something. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6000.34s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6001.84s)]
*  He said. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6003.36s)]
*  You could subdue him in other ways. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6004.2s)]
*  He said he was hungry, thirsty, [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6006.12s)]
*  and ready to die or go to jail. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6008.160000000001s)]
*  And then there's. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6009.320000000001s)]
*  That's scary. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6010.64s)]
*  Some people are saying that he was harassing other people. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6011.46s)]
*  Like trying to. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6013.88s)]
*  Made half lunch movements. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6014.72s)]
*  Yeah, the dude has mental illness. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6015.56s)]
*  Miles, what'd you say? [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6017.400000000001s)]
*  There's other people that said he made half lunch movements [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6018.240000000001s)]
*  and said I will kill. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6021.0s)]
*  But these are all obviously just. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6021.96s)]
*  I mean, yeah, I will kill is different. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6023.6s)]
*  And if there's wives, and if there's kids and moms, [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6025.320000000001s)]
*  it's like, eh, that's a different thing. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6027.400000000001s)]
*  And it's easy to say, oh, he should have. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6030.0s)]
*  But if you're in that situation, it's harder to say. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6032.38s)]
*  But it's harder to do. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6035.400000000001s)]
*  So I should do this. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6036.88s)]
*  This is only a tragedy because he's mentally ill. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6037.92s)]
*  If he was a sane person that was on the subway [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6041.0s)]
*  telling people I plan to kill, I don't go fuck, [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6044.96s)]
*  I'm ready, whatever. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6047.04s)]
*  I agree. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6047.96s)]
*  And some of the. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6048.8s)]
*  The tragedy is mentally ill people are not in control [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6049.64s)]
*  of their body and they're not in control of their actions. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6051.72s)]
*  Yeah, or their minds. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6055.28s)]
*  Or their mind. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6056.24s)]
*  And they do these fucked up things. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6057.06s)]
*  And we don't really have a system that can support them. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6059.16s)]
*  If you're somebody that's living below the poverty line, [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6061.36s)]
*  I don't know if this guy is, [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6063.86s)]
*  there's literally nothing for you but jail [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6065.1s)]
*  and the psych ward. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6066.9800000000005s)]
*  It's tragic. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6067.820000000001s)]
*  And that's why, even though I made it a joke, [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6068.660000000001s)]
*  I think a New Yorker would have recognized. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6070.42s)]
*  Yeah, and they would have just like, [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6072.42s)]
*  hey, let's go to a different car, et cetera. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6073.46s)]
*  I agree with you there. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6075.58s)]
*  But if this is just a regular guy who's just like, [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6077.84s)]
*  you know what, fuck people today [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6080.860000000001s)]
*  and I'm gonna go harass them and then this happens, [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6082.06s)]
*  I'm like, whatever. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6083.9400000000005s)]
*  The fact that he has the mental illness, [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6085.06s)]
*  I feel really badly. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6086.6s)]
*  Now here's the thing. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6087.54s)]
*  There are serial killers that are mentally ill. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6088.38s)]
*  You gotta get them the fuck out of here. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6090.58s)]
*  Just because you have a mental illness [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6092.54s)]
*  doesn't mean you have an excuse to harass people, [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6093.74s)]
*  to hurt people, to murder people, [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6095.94s)]
*  to break a woman's orbital bone. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6097.639999999999s)]
*  That's not an excuse. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6099.46s)]
*  It's tragic that you're not in control of your body. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6100.46s)]
*  That sucks. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6103.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6104.66s)]
*  I guess I'm curious, is there a middle ground? [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6105.5s)]
*  Is what Jordan Penny did to subdue him, [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6107.26s)]
*  or Daniel Penny did to subdue him good? [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6110.84s)]
*  Yeah, he probably should have subdued him. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6113.099999999999s)]
*  Did he go too far? [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6114.139999999999s)]
*  Accidentally kill a guy? [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6115.66s)]
*  I think that's the question. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6116.5s)]
*  That's wrong. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6117.32s)]
*  I don't think people have a. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6118.16s)]
*  How do you know? [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6119.0s)]
*  When do you know? [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6119.82s)]
*  I don't know what too far is. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6120.66s)]
*  I mean, it's a tragic mistake. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6121.5s)]
*  I don't think you should be criminally liable. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6122.34s)]
*  I don't think it's manslaughter or homicide. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6124.02s)]
*  I think you should be free. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6124.86s)]
*  He's also not a UFC fighter [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6125.7s)]
*  who's choking people out all the time [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6127.18s)]
*  and knows when they're fucking done. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6128.6s)]
*  He's a former Marine. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6130.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6130.900000000001s)]
*  That doesn't mean he's a UFC fighter. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6132.34s)]
*  You still, I think, have some idea. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6134.22s)]
*  But you're trained for combat. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6135.06s)]
*  Yeah, you're trained for combat. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6135.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, but I don't think that you're jujitsu-ing the Taliban. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6137.34s)]
*  Right? [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6140.14s)]
*  I mean, but even more the reason [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6141.34s)]
*  why would you use that type of. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6143.9400000000005s)]
*  How many guys do you think he's choked out in his life? [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6145.42s)]
*  I think what he's doing [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6148.06s)]
*  is doing what he believes to be the safest version of it, [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6148.900000000001s)]
*  which is I can choke him out, pass him out, [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6151.54s)]
*  and then we can wake him back up [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6154.0199999999995s)]
*  like it happens in jujitsu gyms all over the country, [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6154.86s)]
*  et cetera. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6157.44s)]
*  That's what I'm assuming. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6158.28s)]
*  I can't be certain, but I'm pretty sure [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6159.099999999999s)]
*  they get trained in doing the same police shit [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6161.08s)]
*  with the armor behind the back and face them. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6163.04s)]
*  So apparently the cops didn't wanna get involved. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6164.96s)]
*  They wouldn't touch Daniel Penny [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6167.2s)]
*  because they thought they were gonna get HIV [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6168.48s)]
*  or something like that, [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6169.5599999999995s)]
*  which is also like if you're Daniel Penny, [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6170.54s)]
*  what the fuck, I'm like, [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6171.96s)]
*  y'all are supposed to do your jobs now. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6172.78s)]
*  Take over. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6173.72s)]
*  I mean, that's how I knew he wasn't from New York [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6174.5599999999995s)]
*  because he touched the homeless. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6175.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6177.0s)]
*  Like, you know, the homeless dudes can get away [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6177.84s)]
*  with murder in New York [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6179.92s)]
*  because we think they all got HIV. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6180.96s)]
*  So they get to touch whoever they want. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6182.6s)]
*  They get to talk to everyone. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6184.52s)]
*  And they got the special type. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6185.360000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6186.360000000001s)]
*  Like, they'll just jump on you [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6187.200000000001s)]
*  and get a little too close. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6188.02s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6188.860000000001s)]
*  That's why you gotta move into another car. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6189.700000000001s)]
*  100%. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6190.72s)]
*  Like that is, you know, game. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6191.56s)]
*  So Daniel Penny, yeah, you should move, [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6192.400000000001s)]
*  but you see that wife and kid, you might be like, [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6193.64s)]
*  and again, I don't know exactly how I feel. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6195.860000000001s)]
*  I'm just doing the both sides thing, [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6197.120000000001s)]
*  but like if you're him, you're like, [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6198.54s)]
*  you're probably looking at the mom and the kids, [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6199.88s)]
*  like, hit the fuck off this train. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6201.400000000001s)]
*  But then if you're the mom, a kid, you might be terrified [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6202.92s)]
*  because this guy's saying, I'll kill you or whatever, [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6204.900000000001s)]
*  and you're just like, if I move, is he gonna lunge at me? [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6206.88s)]
*  What do I do? [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6209.0s)]
*  I'm paralyzed with fear. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6209.84s)]
*  And then if you're this guy, you're like, [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6210.66s)]
*  all right, man, I gotta do something [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6211.88s)]
*  because they're not fucking leaving. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6212.92s)]
*  And this is what it is. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6213.76s)]
*  I do get the feeling of, like, feeling [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6214.96s)]
*  that you need to do something to protect other people, [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6217.4400000000005s)]
*  especially your wife and kid, [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6219.4800000000005s)]
*  but I just think he took it too far. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6220.84s)]
*  And I do think, yeah, some people make mistakes [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6222.360000000001s)]
*  and you have to pay a price for making a mistake. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6224.56s)]
*  Shouldn't he be criminally liable? [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6227.76s)]
*  I do think he should be. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6229.24s)]
*  Well, I'm honestly asking, [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6230.28s)]
*  what's like a punishment to you years-wise, whatever? [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6231.88s)]
*  I don't really know how long you get, [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6235.04s)]
*  but I think this is typical manslaughter. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6236.38s)]
*  You did not intend to kill somebody, [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6239.5s)]
*  but you killed him by accident. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6241.3s)]
*  So whatever charge comes along with manslaughter, [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6243.5s)]
*  I think that's- [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6245.3s)]
*  Five years or something, I think it's kind of light. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6246.12s)]
*  I mean, don't you wanna reward Samaritans [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6248.06s)]
*  for protecting other innocents? [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6251.34s)]
*  No, we have police for that. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6252.9800000000005s)]
*  That is true. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6254.18s)]
*  It doesn't cross the line of vigilante shit. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6255.02s)]
*  That is what- [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6257.9800000000005s)]
*  But a vigilante to me is going out looking for something, [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6258.82s)]
*  whereas this guy just sees something go wrong. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6260.9800000000005s)]
*  And the thing where I was- [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6262.54s)]
*  Everybody else on the train just moved away and ignored it. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6263.38s)]
*  No, there was another guy that assisted [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6266.139999999999s)]
*  and subdued his hands. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6267.339999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6268.58s)]
*  There was another guy that, [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6269.419999999999s)]
*  afterwards they put him on his side [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6270.24s)]
*  and basically to make him not choke on a spit or his tongue. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6271.7s)]
*  To be like, oh yeah, we don't wanna kill him. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6275.0599999999995s)]
*  We're gonna put him on his side. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6276.459999999999s)]
*  Those are the people that after guys win in a fight, [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6277.28s)]
*  you come in after and you put a kick in their face. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6278.86s)]
*  You really do it. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6280.9s)]
*  And so to me, manslaughter's like, [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6282.339999999999s)]
*  oh, you're texting and driving [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6283.86s)]
*  and you hit someone in the crosswalk. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6285.219999999999s)]
*  That was an innocent person that did nothing wrong, [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6287.139999999999s)]
*  just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6289.0s)]
*  You didn't mean to kill them, [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6290.24s)]
*  you were texting and driving, not paying attention. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6291.08s)]
*  And it's unfortunate- [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6292.94s)]
*  That's a version of it. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6293.78s)]
*  But this is where I would say, [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6294.9s)]
*  again, they even took off the manslaughter thing. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6296.54s)]
*  The judge was like, yeah, this is not gonna stick. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6298.42s)]
*  And that's where they went with, [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6299.9s)]
*  what was it, negligent homicide? [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6300.86s)]
*  And so they moved it down another one. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6302.98s)]
*  And again, negligent homicide is basically [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6305.42s)]
*  exactly what it sounds like. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6307.259999999999s)]
*  And according to, hey, he got tried in a court [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6308.299999999999s)]
*  with 12 of his peers and he got found non-guilty. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6311.0s)]
*  So who am I to say? [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6313.62s)]
*  I just feel that in this case, we can't allow that [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6315.86s)]
*  because now this gives the okay [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6319.139999999999s)]
*  for other people to do this. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6321.12s)]
*  I think people call him a hero. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6322.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's why. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6324.099999999999s)]
*  I see that going to be like, all right, [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6324.94s)]
*  I almost feel like the same way with Kyle Rittenhouse. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6326.46s)]
*  Where people are like, oh, Kyle Rittenhouse. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6328.66s)]
*  It's not the same exact thing, but like, oh look, he killed- [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6330.099999999999s)]
*  Subway did get a little bit safer though. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6333.0199999999995s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6334.62s)]
*  We've been seeing them stories on the subway, [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6337.9s)]
*  XYZ is happening, maybe now not so much. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6339.82s)]
*  What is the racial component here? [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6343.42s)]
*  Is this different if it's- [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6347.54s)]
*  If it was white Michael Jackson, [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6349.34s)]
*  I think he still gets killed. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6350.42s)]
*  But it's different if it's a white guy doing it [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6352.219999999999s)]
*  and a white guy kills him. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6354.38s)]
*  It's upsetting when I'm the only one as much so. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6355.219999999999s)]
*  Or a black guy does it and a black guy's killed. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6356.5s)]
*  Like if it's not cross racial. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6358.7s)]
*  It's not as- [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6360.86s)]
*  This is America, the story's always bigger when it's- [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6361.7s)]
*  Add some gas on it for sure. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6365.0199999999995s)]
*  For a reason, but yeah. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6366.7s)]
*  But so it probably wouldn't just be a national story [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6368.38s)]
*  if it's the same, if it's Asian on Asian [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6372.34s)]
*  or if it's Indian on Indian, whatever it is. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6374.34s)]
*  It just wouldn't be a national story, [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6376.62s)]
*  we wouldn't even know about it. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6377.66s)]
*  Probably. Probably not. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6379.42s)]
*  So we know about it because of the racial component, [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6381.1s)]
*  but that doesn't mean that it's less frustrating [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6383.900000000001s)]
*  or divisive. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6387.1s)]
*  Right. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6388.740000000001s)]
*  So the racial component puts the gas on it, [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6389.58s)]
*  which makes it on everybody's radar, [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6391.620000000001s)]
*  but the situation itself is the divisive thing. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6393.9800000000005s)]
*  You see what I'm trying to ask? [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6399.34s)]
*  Or does the racial component make it divisive? [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6401.14s)]
*  It adds to the divisiveness. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6404.780000000001s)]
*  I feel that, because I think some people [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6405.9800000000005s)]
*  immediately just see the racial component first [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6409.38s)]
*  before even knowing all the facts. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6412.3s)]
*  So they're forming all of their- [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6413.62s)]
*  Yes. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6415.26s)]
*  Got it, they're forming their decision-based- [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6416.1s)]
*  And we see that shit online all the time. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6417.02s)]
*  So it's white guy chokes out black guy [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6418.78s)]
*  and he is considered innocent and a hero. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6423.06s)]
*  And looking for a ways, [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6425.74s)]
*  they only looking for ways where this guy is- [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6427.900000000001s)]
*  Justified what they feel. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6429.82s)]
*  Got it. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6431.5s)]
*  Whereas if it was white guy chokes out white guy [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6432.34s)]
*  and he's innocent, there's just less of a care about it [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6434.860000000001s)]
*  because it doesn't tap into preconceived notions [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6438.14s)]
*  that we have about groups, or not even groups, [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6440.780000000001s)]
*  just how the world treats us. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6442.9400000000005s)]
*  And you can empathize with a black person [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6445.42s)]
*  that's looking at going, man, if it was me [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6447.42s)]
*  who did this to some white person, [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6449.860000000001s)]
*  I'd be locked up, guaranteed, [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6451.02s)]
*  but when some white person does it to someone [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6452.660000000001s)]
*  that looks like me, they're free. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6454.06s)]
*  Or a black person being the reason they choke him out [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6455.58s)]
*  till he dies because they don't respect his life as much. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6457.42s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6459.26s)]
*  If it was a white guy, he would have been like, [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6460.1s)]
*  all right, you're good, let me subdue you and not you. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6460.92s)]
*  And based on experiences in that person's life, [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6462.9400000000005s)]
*  you can go, okay, I can see why he's informed, [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6465.22s)]
*  and this decision is informed in this way. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6468.22s)]
*  But it doesn't mean that justice wasn't served, [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6470.42s)]
*  which is what you said. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6473.5s)]
*  Like a jury of his peers looked at this, [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6474.34s)]
*  all the information, way more information than we fucking [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6476.52s)]
*  got, and they were like, he's not guilty. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6478.52s)]
*  So there might be things that they know [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6481.08s)]
*  that we're just not aware of [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6482.860000000001s)]
*  that made them come to that conclusion. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6484.66s)]
*  And if it's a New York City fucking jury, [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6487.9800000000005s)]
*  it's not gonna be a bunch of white guys that look like him. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6490.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6491.9400000000005s)]
*  So it's... [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6492.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6493.62s)]
*  But it does change the lens. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6494.46s)]
*  And then you have activists on both sides. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6495.42s)]
*  Like again, one side being like, this guy's amazing, [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6496.86s)]
*  we need more of this. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6498.86s)]
*  And it's like, all right, well, that seems a little far. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6499.74s)]
*  But then people on the other side being like, [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6501.139999999999s)]
*  Jordan Neely was only killed because of his skin color. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6502.7s)]
*  And it's like, well, I don't know if that's true. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6504.74s)]
*  Now, when somebody comes on the train [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6506.179999999999s)]
*  and they try to do that thing where they like dance [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6507.9s)]
*  and do flips and throw their hat in the air, [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6509.62s)]
*  and you know that? [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6511.219999999999s)]
*  I love that. Showtime. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6512.38s)]
*  Now, if they try to do Showtime, [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6513.219999999999s)]
*  is there a part of you where you just get up [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6515.219999999999s)]
*  and you go like, just to shut it down? [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6517.099999999999s)]
*  Not to Showtime. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6520.34s)]
*  Showtime is kind of entertaining. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6521.34s)]
*  No, that hack story where my dad kicked me out [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6523.14s)]

*  because one time my boy started laughing. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6532.820000000001s)]
*  My boy's crazy. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6537.14s)]
*  Giant black dude, this gay white dude comes on, [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=6538.3s)]

*  He produced some really cool stuff [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7193.12s)]
*  And now he has gone on [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7195.12s)]
*  And created this venture [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7197.12s)]
*  That is Arctic [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7199.32s)]
*  These look like just regular shorts [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7201.32s)]
*  They are not regular shorts [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7203.32s)]
*  They are shorts for you when you're getting in your cold plunge [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7205.32s)]

*  And I want to look out for him [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7217.32s)]
*  And the basic idea is [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7219.32s)]
*  Don't let your balls being cold stop you from getting the benefits of a long cold plunge [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7221.32s)]
*  Protect your balls [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7223.32s)]
*  And then get all the benefits that the cold plunge has [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7225.32s)]
*  Stay in there longer [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7227.5199999999995s)]
*  Reduce that inflammation [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7229.5199999999995s)]
*  Do all those things that make you feel good [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7231.5199999999995s)]
*  Get another few minutes away from your wife and family [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7233.5199999999995s)]

*  So what happened [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7297.72s)]
*  So Syria fell, the Assad regime fell [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7299.72s)]
*  Refugees took over [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7301.72s)]
*  Some shit like that [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7303.72s)]
*  What's it [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7305.72s)]
*  You could have just [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7307.72s)]
*  He was talking about my airport thing [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7309.72s)]
*  My airport thing made sense [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7311.72s)]
*  I'm just stupid [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7313.92s)]
*  It's not funny, it's worse [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7315.92s)]
*  I think we need Arqas to explain it to us [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7317.92s)]
*  Oh this is going to be good [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7319.92s)]
*  Tell us what happened [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7321.92s)]
*  I think some refugees came back to Syria [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7323.92s)]
*  Took that shit back [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7325.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, Fuji La [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7327.92s)]
*  You know what I mean [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7329.92s)]
*  That's what I think happened [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7331.92s)]
*  Assad fell, I don't know who Assad is [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7333.92s)]
*  To be honest with you [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7335.92s)]
*  That's everything I knew [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7337.92s)]
*  Just make a Lauryn Hill reference [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7339.92s)]
*  Yeah you got that [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7342.12s)]
*  You're a little late to it [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7344.12s)]
*  Here's the reality, none of us really know what happened in Syria [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7348.12s)]
*  But [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7350.12s)]
*  It looked like Russia's a little preoccupied [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7352.12s)]
*  With Ukraine [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7354.12s)]
*  They can't back Syria anymore [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7356.12s)]
*  The Assad regime needs that Russian support [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7358.12s)]
*  In order to stay in power [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7360.12s)]
*  Russian support is gone [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7362.12s)]
*  Now Russia loses their influence in Syria [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7364.12s)]
*  Do we swoop in? [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7366.12s)]
*  Who swoops in and takes over Syria? [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7368.12s)]
*  Is this a win for the neocons? [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7370.32s)]
*  Is this the exact thing [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7372.32s)]
*  That the American neocons wanted? [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7374.32s)]
*  The war hawk Americans wanted? [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7376.32s)]
*  Did they fund the Ukraine war to get [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7378.32s)]
*  Russia out of Syria [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7380.32s)]
*  So that they couldn't build some pipeline [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7382.32s)]
*  Or something or the other [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7384.32s)]
*  To fuck over western influence in the region [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7386.32s)]
*  Who knows [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7388.32s)]
*  And doesn't Syria get money from Iran? [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7390.32s)]
*  I think they were financed by Turkey in this one [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7392.32s)]
*  Right? [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7394.32s)]
*  I think it was Turkey back in the day [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7396.32s)]
*  I think it was Turkey backing them [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7398.5199999999995s)]
*  The rebels were backed by the Turks [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7400.5199999999995s)]
*  But Assad was backed by Iran and Russia [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7402.5199999999995s)]
*  So that's why I heard [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7404.5199999999995s)]
*  It was a win for the Jews [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7406.5199999999995s)]
*  Well it definitely went for the Jews [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7408.5199999999995s)]
*  Because you guys get a little land up there [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7410.5199999999995s)]
*  So you can leave them Palestinians alone now [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7412.5199999999995s)]
*  There's just a buffer [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7414.5199999999995s)]
*  Starts as a buffer [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7416.5199999999995s)]
*  Starts as a buffer [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7418.5199999999995s)]
*  Starts as a buffer [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLy-57IcWs&t=7420.5199999999995s)]
