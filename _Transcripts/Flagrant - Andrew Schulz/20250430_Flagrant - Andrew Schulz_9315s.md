**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM)
*  What's up everybody? Today we're joined by the most punctual black comedian in America. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=0.0s)]
*  And he's here to break down Shannon Sharpe's future. He shares some insane stories of living [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=5.2s)]
*  with one of LA's most dangerous gangsters who is currently serving life in prison. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=9.6s)]
*  He reveals a private conversation he had with OJ Simpson and how Charlemagne and I [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=14.4s)]
*  played a key role in his very public divorce. That's my goal for 2019. 16 years. How long [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=19.36s)]
*  are you faithful? Give it up right now for the legend himself, Gary Owen. Gary is a legendary [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=24.64s)]
*  comedian. Absolutely hilarious. There's no special. No S is available at mint comedy.com. Make sure [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=34.32s)]
*  you go check that out. It's Gary Owen. No S. You hear that? We know that. There's one person on the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=40.32s)]
*  couch that might not. Black people love the letter S. Can I get some shrimps? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=47.84s)]
*  Do Latinos do that too? Do they pluralize? I don't know. Yeah, you don't know. I don't know. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=63.6s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't know it was just my friends until Kanye said Prince Williams ain't doing it right. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  If you asked me and I was like Prince William. How the fuck do you get Williams? It's not a last name. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=74.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Black people love that letter. Is it really Serena Williams? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=79.04s)]
*  I've never Googled that. I don't know. That's crazy. Anyway, you're a big football fan, right? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=86.56s)]
*  What did you make of the Shador Sanders thing? Do you care about college ball at all or are you just [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=92.4s)]
*  bangles? Yeah, yeah, I think we made a lot of nothing. It's not the first guy to drop. Five [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=96.8s)]
*  rounds is crazy though. There was really only like five or six teams looking for a quarterback [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=102.4s)]
*  in the beginning. It wasn't like 32 teams. Like the Bengals was not going to get him. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=108.56s)]
*  You know what I mean? The Ravens were not going to get him. So when they act like all 32 teams, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=113.04s)]
*  I go really we all knew it was five or six teams. It was the Giants, the Saints, the Titans. They [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=117.44000000000001s)]
*  went and got Cam. Wars. They were out. Right. Literally every round you were looking at 14. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=123.92s)]
*  That's right. You already got a quarterback. You're not even picking it up. Here's what I disagree. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=129.84s)]
*  I think there's five or six teams not looking for a quarterback. The Bengals because they got [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=132.8s)]
*  Burrow. The Ravens because they got Lamar. The Bills because they got Josh Allen. Couple other [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  teams. If your quarterback isn't that tier, the Chiefs, Smallhomes, you're looking for a [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=140.56s)]
*  quarterback. If you're the Cowboys, you got Dak Prescott. He's old. He's coming off a season ending [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  injury twice in the past three years. Draft a fucking quarterback. Most teams, your quarterback's [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=149.28s)]
*  not good. So you might as well draft a guy, take a chance in the third, fourth round and just see [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=154.08s)]
*  what happens. Well, I'm also thinking next year is supposed to be quarterback heavy. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=157.68s)]
*  So do you want to bring him in? Now you're not going to win. You know what? Let's hold off. Get [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=161.6s)]
*  this delignment. Get this. And what's that thing? If you have two quarterbacks, you have no quarterbacks. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=166.56s)]
*  Yeah. And the Browns got five. But he's got a shot. He's in a perfect situation now. So explain. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=170.32s)]
*  Yeah. Because the expectations are low. Very low. Now you can only exceed expectations. And build a [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=177.60000000000002s)]
*  new stadium. If he comes in balls, they're going to be in a dome next year. Oh, wow. I mean, he's [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=181.84s)]
*  going to be comfy. Yeah. Yeah. He's going to be, that's what he keeps saying. He's in the cold. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=186.56s)]
*  He goes, no, he's not. Yeah. He's got no weather to worry about after next year. That's great. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=189.6s)]
*  Yeah. It was weird. It's like, I don't understand if GMs or if NFL GMs are like the most open-minded [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=194.48s)]
*  people or they're racist because it's like, if you beat your wife, they'll be like, they expect [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=201.76s)]
*  that a black quarterback. Oh, wow. Wow. Oh my God. There he is. You should have went on the pivot. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=207.52s)]
*  Come on. I think GMs are racist. That's my point. I watch it happen with a black quarterback every [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  year. Justin Field went to a bad situation. He wasn't good. But Fields? Fields. He should have. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=222.4s)]
*  They got done pushing everything. That fell for no reason. Lamar Jackson fell out of the first [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=228.96s)]
*  round. It's always, I don't see this happen with white quarterbacks very often. What are you talking [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=234.48s)]
*  about? Tim Couch won the Heisman at Nebraska. They drafted him and said, you got to switch [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=237.67999999999998s)]
*  positions. Because he sucked. Somebody could say the same thing about Shador. 25 years ago, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=240.79999999999998s)]
*  Shador can actually throw a ball. Tim Couch played in like a wishbone off. Sports, sports, sports. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=245.6s)]
*  I'm just saying. No, this is good. I like this. Sports and races collide. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=249.76s)]
*  I'm a very proponent of black quarterbacks. They come to see me. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=254.08s)]
*  I've been seeing some white people at your shows recently, bro. Yeah, it's starting to happen. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  I've been seeing some fucking white people at your shows. And gays. I saw that clip with the gays. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=273.2s)]
*  Whoa, dude. I did this gay guy sat in the front. No, the moment there was like five of them. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=278.24s)]
*  Well, that's what I was getting to. There was a gay guy sat in the front in Ontario. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=283.84s)]
*  And we got it. It just, the stars aligned. It was perfect. He laughed at every joke. He was [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=288.4s)]
*  open to everything. He had like, my boyfriend tastes better shirt or something like that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=294.23999999999995s)]
*  Posted that. It did great on the internet. And then I come to Houston and then there's a line [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=299.28s)]
*  of gay guys like, yeah, we saw the video. I was like, oh, this might be the audience. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=304.71999999999997s)]
*  I didn't even know. So the tall time. They love us. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=309.6s)]
*  Gary, no arm. That's fucking awesome. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=321.44s)]
*  Fucking cracker. White people showing up to your shows, gay show up to your shows. This is crazy. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=329.92s)]
*  You're like 20 something years into how many years? 25, seven. So 28, 28 years into your career. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=335.84s)]
*  Wow. Harlem. White people found you. They did. You started posts on YouTube, Instagram, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  white people find you. The gays find you. Now, how does the black community feel about this? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=349.2s)]
*  They've held you down for 28 years. I've, I've, I've got enough equity in the community. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=353.84s)]
*  Then it's fine. They're good. So they're just, they don't feel like the white people are taking [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=358.4s)]
*  the thing that they started. Well, I got to buy their tickets sooner. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=362.72s)]
*  That should happen to me too. Cause you know, for years my audience was only black, right? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=371.76000000000005s)]
*  Like people knew me from guide code and they knew it from brilliant idiots. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=375.44000000000005s)]
*  And so I do clubs around the country and like the owners would say, which I'm sure they said [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=378.8s)]
*  to you initially, they were like, you look the way you look and your audience does like, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=383.04s)]
*  what exactly is going on? They didn't understand it. And, and it was funny. Like once, once I did [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=386.24s)]
*  Rogan and like white people started finding out about me, then white people buy tickets in [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=391.36s)]
*  November for a show. And you're in line early on that. Yeah. Yeah. You, you, you, you, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=394.96000000000004s)]
*  MSG would have been sweating bullets. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=400.48s)]
*  I had a rumor and I don't know this true, but maybe DL can, uh, DL Hughley can confirm it one day, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=408.72s)]
*  but when he got the Hughley's, it really crossed him over in the mainstream. And the rumor was, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=414.24s)]
*  why he got the neck tattoos. He was like, I gotta keep these white people. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=420.96s)]
*  The rumor was he would tell the, the comedy clubs this show don't sell in advance because they were [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=424.8s)]
*  all white people's bias. So far in advance, he goes like the late show Saturday, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=431.12s)]
*  we're not putting that on sale yet. That was the rumor I heard. That's cool. That's awesome. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=435.36s)]
*  Yo, Gary, here's a good question, right? Both of us have done uncle Shannon's podcast. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=440.56s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. This is really why we wanted you to be on here outside of your special being out. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=445.28s)]
*  You having this prolific career, been one of the most successful touring [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=450.79999999999995s)]
*  comedians in American history. You've been doing this for 28 years. Okay. A lot of people [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=453.76s)]
*  don't realize that people have little bumps and blips, but 28 years is not a game. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=457.84s)]
*  You go on Shannon's podcast almost immediately afterwards, some little white girl sues him for, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=462.15999999999997s)]
*  uh, a horrible thing. Did you introduce, did [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=467.91999999999996s)]
*  you know that? That's completely out of my wheelhouse. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=476.23999999999995s)]
*  You're trying to bring it back. I've said it numerous times. I ain't had white pussy since [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=481.84s)]
*  white pussy had me. No way. You haven't had a little. One 1996. That's where I was born. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=486.71999999999997s)]
*  Met her at TGI Fridays. Whoever you are, you ruined everything. It was on highway eight in [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=493.67999999999995s)]
*  San Diego. It was bad. No, no, no, no, no. You never went back. No, she was a white girl that [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=500.88s)]
*  only liked black dudes and she said, and we both said, we're just going to try. She tried to [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=508.64s)]
*  introduce you to what happened. We both made a consistent decision. You know what? Bucket list. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=514.56s)]
*  Check. Like a gay and lesbian hooking up to sit. Just to try. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=519.68s)]
*  I didn't realize that didn't sound good. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=525.68s)]
*  Okay. So why you never, you never, you never into white girls or were they not into you or what was [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=531.76s)]
*  it? A little bit of both. It was like, even when I was in the Navy, we go out, I was staying in [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=536.0799999999999s)]
*  San Diego and we go out to Pacific beach. It's all beach bars, white people. There'd be one black [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=542.88s)]
*  girl. And at the end of the night, my boys would be like, how does this happen every night? I'd just [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=547.1999999999999s)]
*  be in the corner. I don't know why. I don't know. Just, they like me. I like them. So [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=552.72s)]
*  we just went with it. And have you been like the first white guy for a lot of black people? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=558.88s)]

*  It's down here. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1107.04s)]
*  How long have you been faithful to this girl? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1111.04s)]
*  Let's shut up. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1113.04s)]
*  Fourty-once. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1115.04s)]
*  Watch how I drink this one. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1117.04s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1119.04s)]
*  Why are you not answering? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1121.04s)]
*  How long have you been faithful? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1123.04s)]
*  That was a big reason for the original divorce. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1125.04s)]
*  We just stopped being intimate. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1131.04s)]
*  You guys stopped having sex? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1133.04s)]
*  I think the last six years, three times. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1135.04s)]
*  Wow. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1137.04s)]
*  To be fair, only one of them stopped having sex. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1139.04s)]
*  When I was on your podcast, that was deep into six. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1141.04s)]
*  That was deep into six. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1143.04s)]
*  God. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1145.04s)]
*  Because you brought this up, I didn't bring this up. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1147.04s)]
*  Is that when you started? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1149.04s)]
*  Kind of like the beginning? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1151.04s)]
*  Is that when you started seeking other holes? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1153.04s)]
*  Extramarital relationships? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1157.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1159.04s)]
*  I mean, it had a big part of it. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1161.04s)]
*  You're not sleeping with your wife. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1163.04s)]
*  Were you trying though? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1165.04s)]
*  You weren't even trying. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1167.04s)]
*  She wasn't either. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1169.04s)]
*  We went through COVID and just never touched. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1171.04s)]
*  It was like, we're watching Walking Dead and All American. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1173.04s)]
*  That was COVID. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1177.04s)]
*  I was watching All American like it was a real team. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1179.04s)]
*  I was like, how's he going to leave Beverly High for Compton? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1181.04s)]
*  I did this with Friday lights. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1185.04s)]
*  I remember that. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1187.04s)]
*  I actually cared about if they were going to win. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1189.04s)]
*  It's really what it came down to. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1191.04s)]
*  That was COVID. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1193.04s)]
*  This clip is from well before COVID. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1195.04s)]
*  I'm just curious on the timeline of all of it. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1197.04s)]
*  We've been five years. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1199.04s)]
*  We separated. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1201.04s)]
*  Gary, I feel like you're getting back into the iced coffee moment. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1203.04s)]
*  You're slowly walking ourselves back in. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1205.04s)]
*  I feel like you are. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1207.04s)]
*  We don't even want to be there. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1209.04s)]
*  You are walking back into it. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1211.04s)]
*  You have a beautiful new marriage right now. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1213.04s)]
*  You have twins. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1215.04s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1217.04s)]
*  I'm sure that's exactly what you wanted. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1219.04s)]
*  Barbara Welch. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1221.04s)]
*  Did we get it down to 55? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1225.04s)]
*  This is not working. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1229.04s)]
*  This divorce was so tragic. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1231.04s)]
*  The way that you describe it. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1233.04s)]
*  You came on Brilliant and you were breaking it down. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1235.04s)]
*  I was crying laughing. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1237.04s)]
*  Do you remember the process server? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1239.04s)]
*  The process server. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1241.04s)]
*  Can you just break down that story a little bit? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1243.04s)]
*  If you feel comfortable. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1245.04s)]
*  It's in the past. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1247.04s)]
*  It's all cleared. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1249.04s)]
*  Can you break down a process server to the lights? [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1251.04s)]
*  When you file for divorce, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1253.04s)]
*  this happens a lot when you have houses in two different states. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1255.04s)]
*  We had a house in Ohio and a house in Gila. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1257.04s)]
*  We had a house in California. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1259.04s)]
*  We had a house in California. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1261.04s)]
*  We had a house in California. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1263.04s)]
*  We had a house in Ohio and a house in California. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1265.04s)]
*  I filed for divorce in Ohio. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1269.04s)]
*  I filed for divorce in Ohio. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1271.04s)]
*  Reason being, obviously, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1273.04s)]
*  financially, usually it's better in Ohio. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1275.04s)]
*  We were registered voters in Ohio. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1277.04s)]
*  We pay taxes in Ohio. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1279.04s)]
*  The real reason is because if you divorce in California, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1281.04s)]
*  you're fucked. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1283.04s)]
*  That too. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1285.04s)]
*  We can't file in California because if it goes down, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1287.04s)]
*  then they're going to come after us for [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1289.04s)]
*  tax evasion and voter fraud. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1291.04s)]
*  I didn't do it out of just California. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1295.04s)]
*  I was like, no, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1297.04s)]
*  we are registered voters. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1299.04s)]
*  Before we built the house in California, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1301.04s)]
*  I asked my accountant, I go, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1303.04s)]
*  I don't want to pay California taxes. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1305.04s)]
*  Can I get a house in California? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1307.04s)]
*  He goes, as long as you spend less than half the year there. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1309.04s)]
*  I'm on the road every year. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1311.04s)]
*  I was like, no problem. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1313.04s)]
*  You've got to keep a residency somewhere else. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1315.04s)]
*  Even if you looked at our neighborhood in California, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1317.04s)]
*  all the license plates was Nevada, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1319.04s)]
*  Arizona, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1321.04s)]
*  California. Everybody was doing the same shit. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1323.04s)]
*  That's really why I filed in Ohio. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1325.04s)]
*  Then, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1327.04s)]
*  I tried to do [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1329.04s)]
*  the somewhat respectable thing. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1331.04s)]
*  I said, hey, I'm not happy. I want to divorce. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1333.04s)]
*  I said, so if there's a knock on the door, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1335.04s)]
*  just so you know, it's probably a process [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1337.04s)]
*  service. You said that to her. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1339.04s)]
*  She was also trying to serve your ass. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1341.04s)]
*  That's when she [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1343.04s)]
*  went and left. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1345.04s)]
*  I was like, this ain't going to be good because I heard the [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1347.04s)]
*  door knocking. The guy was knocking. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1349.04s)]
*  She wouldn't answer. I go, I think the door is knocking. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1351.04s)]
*  She goes, it's probably Amazon. I go, fuck. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1353.04s)]
*  She knows. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1355.04s)]
*  She's about to do something. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1357.04s)]
*  She didn't answer the door. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1359.04s)]
*  Two days later, the TMZ shit came out [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1361.04s)]
*  where she filed in LA [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1363.04s)]
*  against me. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1365.04s)]
*  I was like, wait, we don't live in LA. We live in the Bay. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1367.04s)]
*  That [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1369.04s)]
*  started off a [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1371.04s)]
*  three-month cat and mouse game of [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1373.04s)]
*  avoiding a process server. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1375.04s)]
*  I went to my boy's house in West [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1377.04s)]
*  Virginia. I was off the grid. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1379.04s)]
*  I wasn't using credit cards, cash. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1381.04s)]
*  They're not going to find me at this dude's house. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1383.04s)]
*  It was damn near deliverance. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1385.04s)]
*  You were hiding at the comedy clubs? [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1389.04s)]
*  Comedy clubs? I was staying [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1391.04s)]
*  at hotels. I'd be under Mohammed Shabazz. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1393.04s)]
*  They would look for me, but then [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1395.04s)]
*  they'd call Wynn because I'm ordering bacon for breakfast. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1397.04s)]
*  Literally the [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1401.04s)]
*  group service guy was like, that is a Muslim. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1403.04s)]
*  I don't need that [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1405.04s)]
*  fucking shit. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1407.04s)]
*  I was at the Four Seasons [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1409.04s)]
*  in Baltimore for two weeks. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1411.04s)]
*  I never left my room. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1413.04s)]
*  I would go to the shows. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1415.04s)]
*  They'd pick [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1417.04s)]
*  me up underneath [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1419.04s)]
*  the hotel. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1421.04s)]
*  We'd drive over. My opener [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1423.04s)]
*  was at this other [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1425.04s)]
*  hotel under my name. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1427.04s)]
*  We were hoping to miss Leo. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1429.04s)]
*  Then [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1431.04s)]
*  they [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1433.04s)]
*  almost got me [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1435.04s)]
*  in Colorado Springs. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1437.04s)]
*  I had my normal [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1439.04s)]
*  opener. He's a bulldog. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1441.04s)]
*  He didn't go with me. I said, I got a bad [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1443.04s)]
*  feeling about next week. You're not with me. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1445.04s)]
*  We weren't in Colorado Springs five minutes. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1447.04s)]
*  I'm crossing the road. I'm getting to the [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1449.04s)]
*  club two hours early. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1451.04s)]
*  This guy goes, hey, Gary. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1453.04s)]
*  I looked and I saw him pulling [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1455.04s)]
*  the paper out of his back. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1457.04s)]
*  I turned into Ricky [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1459.04s)]
*  from Boys in the Club. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1461.04s)]
*  He started [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1463.04s)]
*  chasing me and he threw [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1465.04s)]
*  the paper at me. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1467.04s)]
*  He threw it. It didn't hit [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1469.04s)]
*  me. One of my guys, I had [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1471.04s)]
*  two guys of me, they both got fired [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1473.04s)]
*  after this weekend. I told him, your one job [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1475.04s)]
*  is to not let him come. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1477.04s)]
*  The dude walked right between them. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1479.04s)]
*  They looked and I said, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1481.04s)]
*  I don't want you to fight nobody but stop [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1483.04s)]
*  him. Then the one guy started [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1485.04s)]
*  looking at the paper. I said, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1487.04s)]
*  don't fucking touch that. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1489.04s)]
*  If they touch it, I could be served. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1491.04s)]
*  Then I go in [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1493.04s)]
*  the dressing room and now I'm turning into [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1495.04s)]
*  Cuba Gooding. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1497.04s)]
*  I'm swinging. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1499.04s)]
*  You know what's money going to cost me? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1501.04s)]
*  It did. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1503.04s)]
*  It was six [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1505.04s)]
*  figures, I'm going to say how much, for [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1507.04s)]
*  jurisdiction. Just going to court [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1509.04s)]
*  and I had to hire a lawyer in California [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1511.04s)]
*  to fight it, fight jurisdiction. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1513.04s)]
*  It was just a big waste of [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1515.04s)]
*  time. But ultimately, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1517.04s)]
*  we got in Ohio. And we settled. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1519.04s)]
*  We got her. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1521.04s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1523.04s)]
*  I go, what happened? [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1525.04s)]
*  We got her. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1527.04s)]
*  We got her at a Panera Bread in Antioch, California. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1529.04s)]
*  It was crazy how it happened. I had [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1531.04s)]
*  hired a process server and I said [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1533.04s)]
*  24-7 surveillance on the house. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1535.04s)]
*  They just said, she doesn't [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1537.04s)]
*  come out. She's not leaving. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1539.04s)]
*  I go, I got a feeling this [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1541.04s)]
*  service company ain't got 24-7 on the [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1543.04s)]
*  house. Then they hit me with [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1545.04s)]
*  a huge bill. And I go, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1547.04s)]
*  I'm not going to pay until you get her [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1549.04s)]
*  served. I hired a process [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1551.04s)]
*  server out of Cincinnati. Me and her flew [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1553.04s)]
*  into town and we had her [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1555.04s)]
*  within an hour. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1557.04s)]
*  We flew from Cincinnati to Sacramento [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1559.04s)]
*  because they said don't fly into Oakland [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1561.04s)]
*  or San Fran because if somebody sees you, they can [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1563.04s)]
*  tip her off here in town. We flew into Sacramento, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1565.04s)]
*  got her in a car, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1567.04s)]
*  we were driving through my neighborhood [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1569.04s)]
*  and right before we got in my neighborhood, there was a grocery store. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1571.04s)]
*  I looked to my left, I swear to God I saw [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1573.04s)]
*  our SUV. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1575.04s)]
*  I was like, that looks like ours. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1577.04s)]
*  We went to the house, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1579.04s)]
*  she wasn't there, I still had the garage door open. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1581.04s)]
*  The garage came up and the car was there. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1583.04s)]
*  I go, let's go back to the grocery store. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1585.04s)]
*  It was her, she was pulling out. We followed her for about [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1587.04s)]
*  15 miles on the highway. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1589.04s)]
*  She pulled into a Panera Bread and she [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1591.04s)]
*  went through the drive-through and she got stuck. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1593.04s)]
*  That's where we got her. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1595.04s)]
*  The lady came out and I had to get on the other side and film it. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1597.04s)]
*  It's a video, so she never saw me. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1599.04s)]
*  She was so focused on the driver's side, I'm right there. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1601.04s)]
*  Filming the whole thing. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1603.04s)]
*  I got back in the car, I was like, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1605.04s)]
*  we freaking got her. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1607.04s)]
*  She goes, you gotta get out of here. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1609.04s)]
*  You can still get served today. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1611.04s)]
*  I had to immediately go to [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1613.04s)]
*  the Oakland airport and I just walked in. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1615.04s)]
*  I'm literally walking down. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1617.04s)]
*  Southwest had a flight. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1619.04s)]
*  I was walking down. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1621.04s)]
*  I would have been on Spirit that day. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1623.04s)]
*  I was just walking down, anybody got a flight out? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1625.04s)]
*  I didn't care where we went. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1627.04s)]
*  I had to get out of California. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1629.04s)]
*  Southwest had a flight and just got on and dipped out. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1631.04s)]
*  And now things are okay? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1633.04s)]
*  What do you mean? Like between you two, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1635.04s)]
*  you're fully divorced? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1637.04s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's been over two and a half, three years. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1639.04s)]
*  Talking at all? [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1641.04s)]
*  Not like that. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1643.04s)]
*  But my son's talking to me. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1645.04s)]
*  I was hesitant to ask because I know that was hesitant. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1647.04s)]
*  No, no, he's good now. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1649.04s)]

*  He's doing good. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1655.04s)]
*  Was that stressful when you were following her on the highway? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1657.04s)]
*  Were you nervous? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1659.04s)]
*  No, here's what's funny. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1661.04s)]
*  The process server's driving [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1663.04s)]
*  and she goes, you gotta get in the back seat. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1665.04s)]
*  She might see you. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1667.04s)]
*  This lady was a bulldog. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1669.04s)]
*  So now I'm in the back. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1671.04s)]
*  I don't think she sees me. She goes, get down! [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1673.04s)]
*  So I don't know where we're at. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1675.04s)]

*  looking in the back for this [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1683.04s)]
*  Nissan Rogue. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1685.04s)]
*  We came to a stop. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1691.04s)]
*  She goes, alright, I need you to get your phone out. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1693.04s)]
*  I didn't even know where we were at. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1695.04s)]

*  And boom. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1699.04s)]
*  No disguise or anything? I would have done a mustache or something. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1701.04s)]
*  Right? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1703.04s)]
*  That was too much. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1705.04s)]
*  That was too much. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1707.04s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1709.04s)]
*  When you go through this for four months though, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1711.04s)]
*  you're always looking like, how is this going to end? [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1713.04s)]
*  I remember when I was in West Virginia, I'd be walking around [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1715.04s)]
*  like, how does this end? [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1717.04s)]
*  Do they get me? [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1719.04s)]
*  Do I get her? [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1721.04s)]
*  It was funny because I'm in West Virginia for a couple of weeks at one point. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1723.04s)]
*  And I just was having [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1725.04s)]
*  Stockholm Syndrome. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1727.04s)]
*  I gotta do something. So I went through an Orange Theory. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1729.04s)]
*  In [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1731.04s)]
*  Huntington, West Virginia, Orange Theory. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1733.04s)]
*  I was in the best shape. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1735.04s)]
*  I'll put it like that. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1737.04s)]
*  I just remember [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1739.04s)]
*  the lady saw my ID [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1741.04s)]
*  and then [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1743.04s)]
*  I'm trying to keep a low profile. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1745.04s)]
*  I'm thinking I'm good at this Orange Theory. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1747.04s)]
*  The whole time she goes, you don't work out like this in California? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1749.04s)]
*  California? I don't like that! [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1751.04s)]
*  I was like, why the fuck are you keep saying my name? [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1753.04s)]
*  She looked like Olivia Newton John [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1755.04s)]
*  mixed with John Travolta. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1757.04s)]
*  She was real rough. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1759.04s)]
*  I'm sure she didn't have a boyfriend. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1761.04s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1763.04s)]
*  I was like, I'm not going to do this. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1765.04s)]
*  I'm not going to do this. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1767.04s)]
*  The way you describe it, it almost sounds fun. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1769.04s)]
*  I'll be honest. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1771.04s)]
*  Like the Prada server? [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1773.04s)]
*  It's an adventure. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1775.04s)]
*  It sounds like a Mr. Beast video. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1777.04s)]
*  You never get served first loses. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1779.04s)]
*  It is wild though. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1781.04s)]
*  I will say [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1783.04s)]
*  it was very like a male bonding experience. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1785.04s)]
*  Because every guy that had been through a divorce [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1787.04s)]
*  reached out. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1789.04s)]
*  Like in my business. Anthony Anderson reached out. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1791.04s)]
*  Kevin reached out. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1793.04s)]
*  I feel like I'm name-drawing. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1795.04s)]
*  But they had all been through messy divorces. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1797.04s)]
*  One of them said, I don't know if it was Shaq or Anthony. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1799.04s)]
*  Because you know, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1801.04s)]
*  when you go through it, you're thinking [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1803.04s)]
*  I'm about to be broke. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1805.04s)]
*  I'm going to be working the rest of my life for somebody else. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1807.04s)]
*  And then [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1809.04s)]
*  one of them said [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1811.04s)]
*  they said, look, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1813.04s)]
*  if you get a chance to settle, settle. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1815.04s)]
*  Your talent won't allow you to go broke. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1817.04s)]
*  And I was like, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1819.04s)]
*  I was very profound. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1821.04s)]
*  Then I was really ready to settle. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1823.04s)]
*  At that point. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1825.04s)]
*  But I also understand that feeling. You've worked your ass off for almost 30 years. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1827.04s)]
*  You've made a bunch of money. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1829.04s)]
*  And now you're faced with this dilemma. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1831.04s)]
*  You're like, I might have to pay all this money to an ex-wife. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1833.04s)]
*  And there goes my security blanket. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1835.04s)]
*  Now I'm back hustling. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1837.04s)]
*  Now I have to do this because I've got to pay bills. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1839.04s)]
*  Not because I want to do it. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1841.04s)]
*  That changes everything. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1843.04s)]
*  Comedy is what? 15 years before you start making money? 10, 12, whatever. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1845.04s)]
*  It's like, you're broke before that. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1847.04s)]
*  Also alimony. Imagine you're paying something off the top. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1849.04s)]
*  You're paying 30% whatever it is before taxes. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1851.04s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1853.04s)]
*  Oh, we have some other stuff I didn't find out about [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1855.04s)]
*  until later too. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1857.04s)]
*  The IRS was coming, baby. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1859.04s)]
*  I had no idea. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1861.04s)]
*  For her? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1863.04s)]
*  For her. We're married. It's joint. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1865.04s)]
*  I was like, oh, I didn't know this was happening. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1867.04s)]
*  That's what scared me more than anything. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1869.04s)]
*  I was like, well, I got to work for the IRS and her. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1871.04s)]
*  Were women upset [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1873.04s)]
*  at you during this whole thing? [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1875.04s)]
*  Because it was public. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1877.04s)]
*  I mean, a lot of them had went through similar things. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1879.04s)]
*  No, I think internet women. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1881.04s)]
*  But real life women. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1883.04s)]
*  So at the shows, they were sympathetic to you? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1885.04s)]
*  Best thing I ever heard was [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1887.04s)]
*  I had gone like a week and a half, two weeks. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1889.04s)]
*  I'm just reading the internet. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1891.04s)]
*  I'm holed up at that Four Seasons in Baltimore. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1893.04s)]
*  Terrifying. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1895.04s)]
*  My first show out the box, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1897.04s)]
*  I'm on stage about 45 minutes in, and lady in the back goes, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1899.04s)]
*  I love you, little cheating ass. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1901.04s)]
*  I was like, man, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1903.04s)]
*  I'm glad I had to hear that. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1905.04s)]
*  That was the only time I was nervous walking on stage [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1907.04s)]
*  in probably about 15, 20 years. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1909.04s)]
*  I didn't know how they were going to react to me. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1911.04s)]
*  You thought the internet was real. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1913.04s)]
*  So you were going to walk on stage and see the food. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1915.04s)]
*  Or you were going to see the dudes sympathetic. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1917.04s)]
*  And the girls are tight. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1919.04s)]
*  No. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1921.04s)]
*  I was like, oh, the internet is not real. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1923.04s)]
*  Why? Why do you think that was? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1925.04s)]
*  You're literally by yourself. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1927.04s)]
*  And you don't know who to trust. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1929.04s)]
*  You're getting... [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1931.04s)]
*  She's finding shit out. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1933.04s)]
*  How is she finding this out? [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1935.04s)]
*  There was some shit she found out that only [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1937.04s)]
*  two or three people knew. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1939.04s)]
*  You got a mole, bro. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1941.04s)]
*  I found all of them out. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1943.04s)]
*  One of my openers. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1945.04s)]
*  Was telling her shit? Get the fuck out of here. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1947.04s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1949.04s)]
*  How did she convert him? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1951.04s)]
*  I had already fired him. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1953.04s)]
*  The year before this came out. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1955.04s)]
*  And then he was like... [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1957.04s)]
*  After the divorce came out, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1959.04s)]
*  then they got in touch and he started giving her [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1961.04s)]
*  all this shit. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1963.04s)]
*  Was she paying him to do it or was he just doing it [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1965.04s)]
*  off the strength of I Hate You? [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1967.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1969.04s)]
*  You can find him at a coffee shop. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1971.04s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1973.04s)]
*  I still follow him. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1975.04s)]
*  Just to see where his life is. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1977.04s)]
*  How's that? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1979.04s)]
*  How's that Gregory's coffee at 3pm on a Sunday brunch show? [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1981.04s)]
*  Bitch. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1983.04s)]
*  Well it's good to know you're not a vendictive. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1985.04s)]
*  I love it. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1987.04s)]
*  You said it in a special. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1989.04s)]
*  I like those posts. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1991.04s)]
*  You keep double-checking. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1993.04s)]
*  You said in a special that after it got out to TMZ [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1995.04s)]
*  that the DMs were crazy. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=1999.04s)]
*  Yeah, that was a little nuts. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2001.04s)]
*  Wait, girls were sliding into DMs? [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2003.04s)]
*  Once they knew that you were single? [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2005.04s)]
*  I guess. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2007.04s)]
*  It was a lot of people shooting their shot. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2009.04s)]
*  And it was all over the place. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2011.04s)]
*  Did you have some fun once you got single? [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2013.04s)]
*  Now you're married, you're obviously a good faithful husband. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2015.04s)]
*  Nah, I was having fun when I was married. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2017.04s)]
*  His throat's clear now. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2019.04s)]
*  It was very compartmentalized. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2021.04s)]
*  The road was the road and home was home. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2023.04s)]
*  Bro, it's so funny. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2025.04s)]
*  The way that you would do it was just so funny, bro. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2027.04s)]
*  I remember once we did a pod. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2029.04s)]
*  You remember back in the day. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2031.04s)]
*  I know where you're going with this. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2033.04s)]
*  This is where I found out Gary's not a white guy at all. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2035.04s)]
*  Because we did this pod. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2037.04s)]
*  He was telling me about us all the time. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2039.04s)]
*  It was beautiful. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2041.04s)]
*  It was inside jokes. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2043.04s)]
*  It was a joke. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2045.04s)]
*  It was one on one. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2047.04s)]
*  Yeah, we were at that restaurant. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2049.04s)]
*  Yeah, gilas. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2051.04s)]
*  It was awesome. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2053.04s)]
*  I was like, you want to go grab a drink? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2055.04s)]
*  He was like, yeah, sure. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2057.04s)]
*  Did you come as well? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2059.04s)]
*  We went to go grab a drink. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2061.04s)]
*  Then Gary pulled up with a fine ass chick out of nowhere. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2063.04s)]
*  But didn't even DM him. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2065.04s)]
*  Didn't even mess with me. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2067.04s)]
*  Yo, by the way, keep this low. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2069.04s)]
*  So now I'm sitting down like, is this his assistant? [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2071.04s)]
*  Who is this fine ass girl? [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2073.04s)]
*  I'm like, Gary, what the fuck? [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2075.04s)]
*  You made me a liar. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2077.04s)]
*  Why are you going to make me fake? [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2079.04s)]
*  You can lie, but don't make me a liar. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2081.04s)]
*  Here comes the sweat. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2083.04s)]
*  Bro, no heads up, nothing. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2085.04s)]
*  I'm supposed to know. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2087.04s)]
*  We all cheaters. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2089.04s)]
*  I should have gave you a heads up. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2091.04s)]
*  Not even a text message. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2093.04s)]
*  She's doing good now. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2095.04s)]
*  That was his assistant. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2097.04s)]
*  Ass assistant. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2099.04s)]
*  She's like, we're married now. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2101.04s)]
*  I remember the weather in Detroit. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2103.04s)]
*  I remember that too. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2109.04s)]
*  Was there any party where you were like, I should probably just let Schultz know I'm a piece of shit? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2111.04s)]
*  No party at all? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2115.04s)]
*  I'm like, fuck it. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2117.04s)]
*  You're at that place where I've heard it and I didn't believe it. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2119.04s)]
*  You almost want to get caught. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2123.04s)]
*  Just to like, fucking let's just end this. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2125.04s)]
*  So you get a little reckless towards the end. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2127.04s)]
*  I think that was like 2019. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2131.04s)]
*  That was early. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2133.04s)]
*  I want to date it. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2135.04s)]
*  Well the shit hit the fan in 2021 for me early. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2137.04s)]
*  I never believed it, but I look at my behavior and I was like, yeah, I wanted to get caught. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2141.04s)]
*  I wasn't like PDA and I wasn't out there at parties bringing people, but I wasn't hiding it either. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2147.04s)]
*  I'm also curious, is there like an OG comic thing? [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2155.04s)]
*  I feel like comics that were on the road in like 80s, 90s, because it was before social media, there was a little bit of a dual life that a lot of comics would do that you can't really do now. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2159.04s)]
*  I only think it's just comics. I think it's entertainers. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2169.04s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's probably fair. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2171.04s)]
*  But specifically like comedians are on the road every single weekend. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2173.04s)]
*  So you have a life on the road and then you got a life at home. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2177.04s)]
*  And I think a lot of these guys before camera phones, before the internet, before social media, you can kind of do whatever you wanted. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2179.04s)]
*  And there was girls in every city and you would go back to those cities and those girls are still there. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2187.04s)]
*  So yeah, you can see how that would definitely happen, especially if like things at home weren't great. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2191.04s)]
*  Comedians, man, you know, you get on the road in the beginning and you're getting attention, you're tapped in socially and you've never had that before. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2197.04s)]
*  And you're just like, oh, I don't even have to talk to girls. They're talking to me. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2207.04s)]
*  Yeah, you know, yeah. So it's it's why do you think that's not happening now? [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2210.04s)]
*  I think it's still probably going on. It's just it's just easier to get caught up. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2215.04s)]
*  Yeah, a girl posts on social media. She's with you. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2219.04s)]
*  You know, she's tagging you in a picture. Your girl's gone. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2222.04s)]
*  What the fuck is this bitch tagging you in a picture? [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2225.04s)]
*  Yeah, I think also part of it, I think that's mainly it. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2227.04s)]
*  But a smaller part, a lot of times now comedians are making more money before they get on the road or as before. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2230.04s)]
*  That's all you had. So you had to only take you. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2234.04s)]
*  Now you can afford to take your boys. So you're kind of just hanging out and you're not as inclined to go out and chase the night where it's like, well, I'm with my homies, so I don't have to. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2237.04s)]
*  Otherwise, it's just you in some random fucking city in Toledo or wherever. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2245.04s)]
*  And it's like, what am I going to do? I'm just here alone. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2250.04s)]
*  Yeah, a fact. What do you think happens to Shannon, man? [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2253.04s)]
*  Have you spoken to him since you guys close? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2256.04s)]
*  And we're cool, but not. It's just it's so weird. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2258.04s)]
*  Like, they know he's coming back in September. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2261.04s)]
*  Bro, I was shocked at how many people like immediately came out and shit on them and shit on it. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2263.04s)]
*  Yeah. Like, what do you think that's about? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2268.04s)]
*  I'm trying to wrap my head around that, because usually when there's an accusation from an OnlyFans girl, it's like, oh, this is some fake shit. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2271.04s)]
*  She just wants some money. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2277.04s)]
*  But with Shannon, the immediate response from like big media figures was, hey, what the hell are you doing? [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2279.04s)]
*  You're fucked up. Why are you doing this? [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2286.04s)]
*  I don't listen. I'm the last person to comment on someone's personal life. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2288.04s)]
*  Yeah, but also the best. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2291.04s)]
*  I've got experience here. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2294.04s)]
*  Yeah, I don't want to be the hypocrite. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2295.04s)]
*  No, you're not. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2297.04s)]
*  Why do you think he's not getting more support? [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2298.04s)]
*  That's what I'm wondering. Why? [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2301.04s)]
*  Think about it. It's very similar to stand up. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2303.04s)]
*  Like, why do the guys that sell the most tickets, people like they shit on them? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2305.04s)]
*  Like, as many people shit on Kevin. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2311.04s)]
*  And if you know Kevin, he's like, literally one of the nicest guys on the planet. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2313.04s)]
*  And you guys just shit on him. You're going, why is that? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2317.04s)]
*  That's because humans just we have an issue with. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2320.04s)]
*  They're kind of want that spot. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2322.04s)]
*  So Shannon was viewed as. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2324.04s)]
*  But then there's people like I saw Stephen A. Smith kind of talking shit. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2326.04s)]
*  But and Stephen A. Smith is at the top. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2330.04s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. You see that? [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2333.04s)]
*  But I think he wants to be the top top. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2334.04s)]
*  Oh, but he so he don't want even anybody second or third. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2336.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's hate. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2339.04s)]
*  That's hate. And then because, yeah, if there's there is a human instinct, there's like jealousy and competitiveness. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2342.04s)]
*  Right. And sometimes it clouds our judgment. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2348.04s)]
*  And we see it happen a lot. You know, like you said, people hate on Kevin. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2350.04s)]
*  He's literally like the nicest, most supportive guy. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2353.04s)]
*  Yeah. But if you're above somebody and hating on someone and being super critical of somebody below you when they're not even convicted, that feels like hate right there. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2355.04s)]
*  Like, why are you even worried about what's happening? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2364.04s)]
*  But Shannon's pod was more successful. So maybe he's like looking at him. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2366.04s)]
*  But it's also clicks. Yeah. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2369.04s)]
*  It's also like you talk about Shannon. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2371.04s)]
*  You're going to like definitely clip it up. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2373.04s)]
*  You're going to get numbers. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2376.04s)]
*  I wonder that was the guy, especially in that John, like, you know, Stephen A wants to comment on, you know, I don't know, the Pope dying is not going to get the numbers of Shannon Sharpe scandal. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2378.04s)]
*  I think part of it is he's angling for president and he's got to be a Smith. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2390.04s)]
*  Yeah, he's not getting the president. No, he wants to run. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2394.04s)]
*  He wants to run. So you want to run. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2397.04s)]
*  You got to morally be like, how could you? [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2399.04s)]
*  I also think that like Shannon's show was you need a clean record to run nowadays. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2401.04s)]
*  Yeah, like Shannon show was like very clicky and like in a lot of ways toxic like Shannon. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2406.04s)]
*  Yeah, Shannon show like you did the show. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2417.04s)]
*  I was crazy how the show was sports based, but the comedians get the biggest numbers. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2419.04s)]
*  Oh, yeah, because comedians out here talking shit. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2423.04s)]
*  Yeah. But like, like I even remember when I was doing it and I love Shannon. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2425.04s)]
*  Like the team was brilliant the way they put it together. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2428.04s)]
*  It was like really good. There's this guy CJ is producing it. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2430.04s)]
*  They're like they're fucking smart. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2432.04s)]
*  But like there are moments where like they stopped the interview and then CJ would hand him a card [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2434.04s)]
*  with questions that were going to be clickable videos and here just ask him these questions. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2438.04s)]

*  No, we got extra recess. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2566.04s)]
*  This school, I went hauling as like, you know, those doors that the gym doors, I know it's locked. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2569.04s)]
*  No, and I had both teeth. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2575.04s)]
*  They were like this. You know, I did a joke. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2578.04s)]
*  Like I went I used to go to Catholic Church and the priest never mess with me. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2581.04s)]
*  And then I found he was messing with all the little boys. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2585.04s)]
*  And I was like, they never fucking me once. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2587.04s)]
*  I'm not letting that mouth hit my shit. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2590.04s)]
*  But once he lost the teeth, then it was like that was an open goal. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2593.04s)]
*  That tooth flew out. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2599.04s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a break for a second. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2601.04s)]
*  One of the most unpatriotic things that I've ever seen is people that refuse to eat cereal outside of breakfast. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2603.04s)]
*  This is bullshit. This is nonsense. It is communism. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2612.04s)]
*  It's what our forefathers were fighting against. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2616.04s)]
*  It's not about tea. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2620.04s)]
*  It's about the ability to have a delicious bowl of cereal, ideally highly packed with protein, zero sugar, you know, the nice good things about modern day magic spoon cereal. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2621.04s)]
*  Having that at any time of day is crucial to the American identity, to the American experience. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2633.04s)]
*  OK, now I know some of you like, well, where am I going to get milk midday? [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2639.04s)]
*  You don't need that because they have high protein granola as well. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2643.04s)]
*  You could take with you. OK, true to the magic spoon promise. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2647.04s)]
*  It's packed with protein. It's so crunchy. It's absolutely amazing. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2649.04s)]
*  OK, OK, well, I don't want to carry a little thing of granola around. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2653.04s)]
*  Sure, they have the treats. Magic spoons, high protein treats are crispy, crunchy, airy, an easy way to get 12 grams of protein on the go. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2656.04s)]
*  So now there's no excuses for you to live like a communist. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2664.04s)]
*  What you can do is be a proud American because they come in mouthwatering flavors like marshmallow, chocolate, peanut butter and dark chocolate, things that don't exist in Europe. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2668.04s)]
*  You can't even find a marshmallow in Europe. You can't find dark chocolate in Asia. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2676.04s)]
*  Definitely not. No. The point I'm trying to make here is magic spoons, brand new granola packs, 13 grams of protein and zero added sugars. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2681.04s)]
*  This is something the European mind could not even conceptualize. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2689.04s)]
*  OK, don't even get me started about the rest of the world. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2692.04s)]
*  They come in delicious flavors like dark chocolate, almond, honey, almond and peanut butter. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2694.04s)]
*  Peanut butter is indigenous to America. Did you know that? Is that true? Yeah, it is true. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2699.04s)]

*  That's it. There's no back end. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2893.04s)]
*  There's no hotel. There's no flight. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2895.04s)]
*  Wow. I was in Columbia, South Carolina. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2897.04s)]
*  I canceled it. And all they said was, is Jeff Klang going to be there? [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2899.04s)]
*  Because he was running Code Black. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2903.04s)]
*  He now I think he runs Kevin's shit. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2905.04s)]
*  So I was like, is he going to be there? [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2907.04s)]
*  And they go, if you promise me he watches my set, I'm in. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2909.04s)]
*  I'm in. They go, we got you. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2912.04s)]
*  I get there. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2914.04s)]
*  They get there on a Friday. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2916.04s)]
*  People know there was ten acts. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2918.04s)]
*  They only aired like five of them. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2920.04s)]
*  Five got cut. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2922.04s)]
*  And so we're backstage and everybody's like arguing over who's going to go last. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2923.04s)]
*  And I go, I'll go last. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2928.04s)]
*  And I remember I looked like, oh, last. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2930.04s)]
*  I knew that's a great I knew I had. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2932.04s)]
*  I never did the black church joke yet, which kind of like the black and white church. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2936.04s)]
*  I go, this I've been doing it at clubs, but it hasn't been aired. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2940.04s)]
*  It was like bringing the house down like one of my strongest probably. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2944.04s)]
*  Something in your pocket right there. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2948.04s)]
*  And the Tiger Woods shit just happened. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2950.04s)]
*  Where's wife? Yeah, I had a fucking strong tiger. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2952.04s)]
*  I said, if nothing else, they only want me to do 10, 15 minutes. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2954.04s)]
*  I think I'm doing 20 because I went last. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2957.04s)]
*  I knew I had like eight that was just going to bring the roof down in the beginning and end. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2960.04s)]
*  So you could package it. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2966.04s)]
*  Boom. So I walk on stage and you're kind of refreshing because you're probably the only like you said, probably only white guy there. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2967.04s)]
*  Yeah. So they've been seeing black dude like and then it's white dude pops up and you kind of waking back up like, oh, shit. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2972.04s)]
*  It wasn't just that. It was it was it was nine comics doing dick pussy jokes. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2977.04s)]
*  And then I came out like hey church. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2982.04s)]
*  And what set the whole set off was Morris Chestnut was in the front row. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2987.04s)]
*  So I walked out, I see Morris Chestnut and I go, hey, I go, oh, literally I go Morris. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2992.04s)]
*  And I go, hey, you guys are boys in a hood and think Ricky's going to live. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=2998.04s)]
*  And I said, I get so mad at you. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3002.04s)]
*  That's why I watch it. I go, you die every time. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3004.04s)]
*  I mean, the Twinkie, bro. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3008.04s)]
*  You passed the test. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3012.04s)]
*  You're going to the army. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3013.04s)]
*  So resets the whole room. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3015.04s)]
*  Live in the moment. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3017.04s)]
*  Right there. Right. Right. Right. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3018.04s)]
*  And so Clannigan saw me and then they sent me to Japan first. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3019.04s)]
*  He wasn't familiar. So the shack was doing the tour. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3024.04s)]
*  So they was like, yo, they want to send you to Japan first to do a show. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3027.04s)]
*  And I go, so I went to Japan. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3032.04s)]
*  I think it was me, Mark Curry, Lunel, a couple of other people. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3033.04s)]
*  Dude, Mark Curry was so fucking good. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3036.04s)]
*  And then I guess the word got back. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3039.04s)]
*  No, he's solid. He's got it. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3041.04s)]
*  Because he only saw 20 minutes. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3043.04s)]
*  Of course. Yeah. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3044.04s)]
*  So then they put me on that shack tour of 2011. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3045.04s)]
*  And then they said, we're going to give you a special. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3049.04s)]
*  We got to deal with showtime. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3052.04s)]
*  OK. On the shack tour, who is who is your group that's going? [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3053.04s)]
*  It was D-Ray, Michael Blackson, Corey Holcomb, me and Capone. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3057.04s)]
*  I mean, just killers. Where are you going up in the show? [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3064.04s)]
*  Right before Corey. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3069.04s)]
*  Corey closed it, D-Ray host it. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3070.04s)]
*  Yeah. And then Michael Blackson and Capone flip flopped. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3072.04s)]
*  Yeah. Half the tour. One would go first, one would go second. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3075.04s)]
*  And then then I would go fourth and then Corey would close it. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3078.04s)]
*  Yeah. Strong. Great show. Yeah. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3082.04s)]
*  Yeah, it was. It was a solid show. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3085.04s)]
*  And all of us kind of did our own thing after it ended. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3087.04s)]
*  And then so they gave me the special. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3089.04s)]
*  So I'm in Vegas. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3092.04s)]
*  I mean, we stopped filming Think Like a Man like two weeks before I'm filming this. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3093.04s)]
*  It's at the Mandalay Bay. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3097.04s)]
*  And I just remember I'm on stage. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3099.04s)]
*  It's sold out. But there's literally in the front two empty rows. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3101.04s)]
*  I'm going, why aren't they filling this? [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3106.04s)]
*  Keep in mind, this is a theater. So rows are 20. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3108.04s)]
*  That's 10, 20 seats. Easy. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3111.04s)]
*  Mandalay Bay, the big theater there. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3113.04s)]
*  Why is this so weird? Why aren't they filling this in? [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3115.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3118.04s)]
*  Floyd has called and said, I'm coming. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3120.04s)]
*  I don't care if there's a special. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3122.04s)]
*  Floyd's the champ at this point. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3124.04s)]
*  He runs Vegas. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3126.04s)]
*  He's bringing a billion dollars every single time he does a fight. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3128.04s)]
*  I'm on stage and I see, I'm 30, 40 minutes in and a commotion happens. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3131.04s)]
*  It's like, there's like all these people just, I thought a fight happened. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3137.04s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3141.04s)]
*  And then it starts coming towards me and I'm going, what the fuck is happening? [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3142.04s)]
*  You know, Floyd's a little guy. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3145.04s)]
*  He's in the middle of these big body guards and I'm going, what's going on? [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3146.04s)]
*  And then I see Floyd, oh Floyd. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3150.04s)]
*  And then I just started talking to him and his entourage for about 15 minutes. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3153.04s)]
*  And then they kept like five of it in the special. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3157.04s)]
*  That's great. That's all I need. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3159.04s)]
*  Just completely in the middle of it. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3160.04s)]
*  I'm like, all right. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3162.04s)]
*  But a lot of people who haven't taped something don't know. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3164.04s)]
*  Like when you're taping anything, it could be a 10 minute set, it could be an hour set. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3167.04s)]
*  Like you're kind of in like a performance mode, right? [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3170.04s)]
*  You're on autopilot. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3173.04s)]
*  You're on autopilot. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3174.04s)]
*  You're on autopilot. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3175.04s)]
*  I need to make sure I get these jokes right. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3176.04s)]
*  And every time you do a joke, it doesn't go as good as it did in fucking Portland. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3178.04s)]
*  You're like thinking about it and editing in your head. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3181.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3183.04s)]
*  And then 20 people walk in 40 minutes into your first 40 people walk in to stay in the moment is one very ballsy. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3184.04s)]
*  But like that's a really a lot of people just ignore it. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3193.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3196.04s)]
*  And try to muscle through. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3197.04s)]
*  That's a courageous thing to do. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3198.04s)]
*  But you do it because you got chops. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3200.04s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3202.04s)]
*  Like you've done a lot of shows where people are walking in in the middle. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3203.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3205.04s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3206.04s)]
*  Like if you go in that check or if you went up first or second slot, people are still walking in. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3207.04s)]
*  Yeah, true, true, true. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3211.04s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3213.04s)]
*  And that's the first time I met Floyd. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3214.04s)]
*  That's the crazy part. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3215.04s)]
*  I thought that he told you he was coming. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3216.04s)]
*  No, they told me he's coming. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3218.04s)]
*  But I didn't tell me he's going to come in the middle of my set. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3221.04s)]
*  The promoters are like, you know, we got to call Floyd's coming. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3224.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3228.04s)]
*  Oh, there it is. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3229.04s)]
*  Did you see it? [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3230.04s)]
*  Oh, metal and special. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3231.04s)]
*  They took over. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3234.04s)]
*  I mean, yeah, that's like a nightmare scenario. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3237.04s)]
*  Nightmare. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3239.04s)]
*  Nightmare. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3240.04s)]
*  And they're all in the front. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=3241.04s)]

*  So BET doesn't know I'm in the Navy [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=4354.4s)]
*  Obviously the Navy doesn't know I'm doing stand-up [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=4356.92s)]
*  There was a funny thing cuz I don't have cable and so I don't know I'm airing [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=4358.719999999999s)]

*  What was it like back in the day when there are fewer channels and you had something pop on TV [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=4384.860000000001s)]
*  Do you make me sound? [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=4391.38s)]
*  I remember like Geico days when [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=4396.1s)]
*  There were just fewer things to watch. Yeah, so when people were watching a show you felt it on the street [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=4399.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah for real like I remember just walking around certain areas, especially like tourist areas in New York City [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=4405.34s)]
*  If you're in Times Square, it was like it felt like every person within an age demographic had watched the show [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=4409.9s)]
*  Yeah with the internet now, it's different like with the internet. There's little echo chamber [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=4414.98s)]
*  So you'll be walking down the street. Somebody recognize you some is like, I don't even know who the fuck that is [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=4419.98s)]

*  It was like if you watched comedy and you watched BET you watched comic view [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=4425.86s)]
*  Yeah, so you didn't miss it. Yeah, so you would instantly feel it. Yeah, does that make sense? [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=4431.66s)]

*  That was kind of similar to my journey like I didn't have a long time where I was going and featuring for yeah [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=4449.38s)]

*  I'm never I've never heard that yeah, it's dated because they remember it's something something had to do with a pager [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7101.12s)]
*  You know, did you use my code on my page? [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7105.96s)]
*  Yeah, I would say quake was a window by one to follow back to any [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7111.200000000001s)]
*  This is a bad question, but there's part of it's like is there any set that you had that was just like [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7116.280000000001s)]
*  absolutely destructive and then [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7123.04s)]
*  Somebody that was big big big just could not step into afterwards [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7125.4s)]
*  Yeah, we don't have to name names. I don't want to name names, but like they [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7131.24s)]
*  It happened at the um, it happened at the Bay Area black comedy competition the same one that Nick won [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7135.28s)]
*  Oh really I had a I don't know what I said, but the guy that went after me [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7140.84s)]
*  Did really bad and it was they used to like call the bombs his name [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7146.88s)]
*  I [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7152.92s)]
*  Can't really guys name though. Oh [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7160.8s)]
*  I remember I just remember he had a pink [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7163.6s)]
*  The only I remember he came after me had a pink sweater with the big white lapels coming out of words [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7165.8s)]
*  It just was really bad that night. I don't like to shit on comics. Yeah, I really can't remember his name though [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7171.360000000001s)]
*  Better not to do it. Yeah, but not to do that. That was a that was a rough one for him [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7177.68s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I mean, I'm curious like so many of the stories is you obviously having so much acceptance within the black community specifically [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7182.92s)]
*  I'm curious was there ever any issue being a white dude in that space that caused you problems or you lost opportunities [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7188.76s)]
*  purely just because of you know, no you look like no, I think I didn't know I [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7195.360000000001s)]
*  Think it's wanting to be a white guy and you're acting like you want to hang out like people when you're ingrained in the culture [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7201.6s)]
*  Mm-hmm. Like like I said, they saw me at the black spots when I got to LA [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7206.72s)]
*  I wasn't I wasn't doing a comedy store all night. I was I was going to Mavericks flat [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7211.22s)]
*  I was going to the Camiac Theatre [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7215.26s)]
*  I was going to all the all the black shit and not not the ones in Hollywood [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7217.26s)]
*  I'm talking with the ones in Compton and on the other side of the the 10 [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7220.34s)]
*  Mm-hmm. You know what I mean? So I don't think I didn't I never saw that [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7224.62s)]
*  Most of the comics was cool [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7228.58s)]
*  It's so weird how like I saw that in New York too [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7230.06s)]
*  Like we would do the black rooms in New York or coming up and I just didn't understand why it was so [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7232.900000000001s)]
*  Divided especially like the black comedy world. Yeah, no like why comics white and black [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7238.94s)]
*  Yeah, there'd be like these white comics that would be doing open mics [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7244.94s)]
*  They'd be trying to get up at the clubs and they would do these open mics [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7247.62s)]
*  They were horrible and the black rooms is what I'll say about the black rooms [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7250.74s)]
*  If you show up and you want to get up, they will get you up [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7253.76s)]
*  That's why I started doing they're way more [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7257.099999999999s)]
*  Accepting into the clubs are not gonna make you send them a tape go do this whole fucking rigmarole and then open mics in the [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7258.78s)]
*  City are just literally that is just comedians that there's no regular audience member [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7264.14s)]
*  So my mind was just like why I want to go up wherever it's not like weird to perform for black people [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7267.54s)]
*  I grew up in New York City, but the what I saw is like mostly the non black comics in New York [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7271.94s)]
*  Would not even venture to the black rooms, which is crazy. Can you figure don't you want to go up in front of people? [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7277.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's something and you and you want to [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7283.82s)]
*  Push yourself like I want to make sure these jokes are they go over wherever I'm at [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7286.22s)]
*  yeah, and also not one thing that I think really taught me in the in the black rooms is like [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7290.78s)]
*  The the black rooms they were not there for you to try your little misdirection math problem [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7296.06s)]
*  Do you know me like like like the white the white audience sometimes will entertain the big? Oh, I see what you did there [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7303.46s)]
*  Yeah, like I got it and the black rooms like oh, yeah. Okay good. Whatever. Oh, so you didn't kill them [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7309.74s)]
*  So I stabbed them oh, I guess you stabbed them, you know [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7316.66s)]
*  It was important that like you acknowledged that we're in this room and I want to go back to that moment [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7320.219999999999s)]
*  We're like Floyd comes back in to fully walks into your special taping. Yeah, like that's you have to be present in the room [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7326.259999999999s)]
*  That's something I learned in the black rooms. You have to be present in the room [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7332.66s)]
*  If you are not present, they'll immediately will just check out on you [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7335.66s)]
*  They're like, are you gonna pretend I'm not here? [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7338.379999999999s)]
*  My emotion has to be real you have to be present like if something weird is happening you have to call it out [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7339.9s)]
*  Yeah [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7344.62s)]
*  I think it's something that's really helped me in my career that I don't think I would have developed in the the white rooms at [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7344.98s)]
*  All or like the whatever you call in the mainstream rooms [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7349.5s)]
*  Yeah, and it's like because they'll give you a little bit of leeway like you like the joke will go over and be like [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7351.62s)]
*  Oh, I guess that one didn't go over and then they're like, all right. Well, what's the next one? [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7357.54s)]
*  Yeah, there's this like politeness that exists, right? Yeah and [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7361.42s)]
*  But yeah, it's interesting like you develop this like really important tool [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7366.46s)]
*  For comedy which is being able to stay present in the moment [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7371.34s)]
*  Not every show is gonna be polite where people are like they waited two weeks to get to get that ticket to go to [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7374.82s)]
*  The cellar and they're ready to go and they're waiting with their hands clasped like this. Yeah, you know, it's yeah [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7379.74s)]
*  I wish more I wish more comics, especially when they're younger would go into the black rooms [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7385.0199999999995s)]
*  I think they learn a lot more. I think I've only been to the cellar once really [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7388.799999999999s)]
*  Do you are you scared to do white rooms? No, not at all. Do you remember the first time? [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7393.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm begging I literally I keep begging my agent and he'll tell you this get me in Salt Lake, please [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7397.94s)]
*  I want to experience everything. Yeah, cuz I don't think you wouldn't cross over. Yeah [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7404.9s)]
*  This latest special it was on purpose and somebody be like don't listen to haters and stuff though the one on on meant right now [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7411.299999999999s)]
*  There's no race jokes and that was a purposeful thing on my part [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7419.42s)]
*  But why I don't think that there's not one mention at all and I was just like, you know what? [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7423.719999999999s)]
*  Cuz how this special came out was the last special I had [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7428.82s)]
*  Broken family [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7433.96s)]
*  We did that on Friday and I woke up Saturday morning and I went I told my manager [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7435.76s)]
*  I think I another hour did we get it last night because we did two shows she's here. We're clean [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7440.84s)]
*  I go I'm gonna do a different hour tonight [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7444.5s)]
*  So we sat there at the coffee shop and we wrote down bullet points [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7446.16s)]
*  I just remember there was there was 12 bullet points and it was like one or two words and we taped it [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7450.8s)]
*  to the stage so I could glance down and [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7455.92s)]
*  Because you know, I didn't want a choppy special was trying I need the flow so we did in the flow of things and [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7459.120000000001s)]
*  And it came out good and then when I wrote I got I looked I said look [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7465.8s)]
*  There's no race jokes in this almost like laughing about it. Yeah, and then when I when I saw it go, all right [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7468.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think I don't think jokes in this shit again. I'm curious, you know, obviously I wanted to be successful [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7474.6s)]
*  Just I love you. But like I don't think that like [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7480.0s)]
*  Staying away from race jokes would change any dynamic. I actually think going on pods and stuff [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7482.240000000001s)]
*  Will communicate to more people that at the end of the day you're a storyteller and like you [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7487.700000000001s)]
*  Watch the wire [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7496.46s)]
*  So to me it's just about like an education process [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7498.860000000001s)]
*  You're a storyteller at the end of day white people probably seen you in these black spaces and then they might go [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7502.38s)]
*  Oh, maybe he's a comic for black people and not for me white people a little concerned about that shit [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7507.02s)]
*  They want to watch black shit from afar, but they don't want to be in it. That's the reason why roots [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7511.58s)]
*  Well [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7516.56s)]
*  was like the number one show on TV in the 70s when that miniseries came out because white feels like I [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7517.76s)]
*  Don't I want to watch this shit. They know who the biggest consumer of hip-hop music is white people, right? [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7522.12s)]
*  I mean, there's like, you know population [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7526.72s)]
*  I'm gonna watch on TV. I just I don't know if I want to go to the concert [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7531.72s)]
*  But there is a little there is a little concern and also like [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7534.9800000000005s)]
*  To defend white people sometimes there also is like a shame. It's like am I am I appropriating this? [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7537.96s)]
*  There's like there's sometimes a slap on the wrist if white people do get too interested [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7542.8s)]
*  They're like, oh you're gonna take this shit from us [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7546.360000000001s)]
*  Which I understand from black perspective as well [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7548.64s)]
*  Which is like they have seen that happen like white people putting cornrows in and all of a sudden trying to make it some white shit [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7550.72s)]
*  So I understand both sides of it [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7555.16s)]
*  But like there is a thing with white people's like they want to like comfortably watch something that they have nothing to do with they really are [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7556.72s)]
*  white people really interested in that kind of shit, but [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7562.72s)]
*  But I think the stories that you tell especially the ones from today [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7565.8s)]
*  My assumption that people are gonna love this and they're gonna be like I want to go check out Gary's like that what the stand-up is [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7569.280000000001s)]
*  Like so I'm very better [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7575.04s)]
*  I do coke on stage [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7580.320000000001s)]
*  I stole key [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7584.360000000001s)]
*  One line in his memory every [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7587.76s)]
*  Sleep [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7591.68s)]
*  I [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7593.68s)]
*  Happened on think like a man the first one. Oh my fucking god the first time we all sat in the bar together [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7614.0s)]
*  And we're in the scene. I'm here. I started leaking just like I was on here and I didn't know why I'm not nervous [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7620.4s)]
*  I'm amongst friends. Yeah, why the fuck am I sweating and I know my body [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7627.0s)]
*  I'm like just get adjusted get adjusted and then when the producers go Jesus Christ [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=7631.5199999999995s)]

*  And meet with four special needs people that were telling me how to write my jokes. And what did they say? How did they say? [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=9003.080000000002s)]

*  And what did they say like what were they saying I said what's funny [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=9037.800000000001s)]

*  You're just telling us a story so they're telling you how to tell the joke to make it more I told them I said I don't [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=9081.36s)]
*  Blame these four people. I mean they all had people behind them that were like they're people I blame you [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=9086.52s)]

*  You don't want them to be made fun of which to me says I'm better than you [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=9093.88s)]

*  You know blah blah blah [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=9107.6s)]

*  Very difficult and they're like I just want to protect them from the evils of the world without realizing that maybe they would laugh at it [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=9114.039999999999s)]
*  As well that part I think that's one of the beautiful things of the love on the spectrum show to be honest [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=9120.08s)]
*  I don't know if you've seen it which is like you they showcase how funny they are [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=9124.28s)]

*  Yeah, I think the the biggest issue what I learned from it was especially if you're a parent of a special needs kid [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=9140.72s)]
*  Where do you direct your anger if I was I'm with my wife and I didn't cheat [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG4QLwA5aM&t=9147.92s)]
