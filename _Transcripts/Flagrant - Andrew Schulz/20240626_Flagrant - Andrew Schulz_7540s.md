# Hawk Tuah x MrBeast OnlyFans Collab??? & Drakes ONLY Way To Bounce Back
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [June 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns)
*  Are we at the point now where Bianca Sensori is more relevant than Kanye West? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=0.0s)]
*  When I see Kanye pop on my screen, I roll. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5.36s)]
*  When I see her, I'm locked in. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=8.2s)]
*  Can I rephrase your question? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  Do I like chicks or guys? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=11.6s)]
*  No. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  And it keeps growing. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=15.44s)]
*  I need to see what the tits look like when he first started dating her. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=16.56s)]
*  And then I need to see what the tits look like now. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=18.92s)]
*  How are you making natural things? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  I have the solution. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=22.88s)]
*  Rob Kardashian is the meat source for the Kardashian family. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=24.04s)]
*  I think he has a storage facility where he is keeping some of that fat from Rob [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=27.88s)]
*  and he is slowly injecting it to Bianca. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=31.8s)]
*  Because if you bring me to the beginning, those tits were beautiful. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=33.68s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=37.2s)]
*  What she came out with the other day was a nuclear catastrophe. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=37.72s)]
*  What I saw at Paris Fashion Week was Chernobyl. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=43.4s)]
*  I showed my wife. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=47.92s)]
*  I showed my wife. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=49.8s)]
*  Come on, dude. Come on, dude. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=51.32s)]
*  That's all. This is the nuclear. What do you call it? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=53.879999999999995s)]
*  It's a nuclear catastrophe. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=56.4s)]
*  It is a nuclear. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=58.68s)]
*  Yeah, you might be right. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=60.24s)]
*  Thank you, dude. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=61.68s)]
*  I don't even think that's Kanye. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=62.44s)]
*  I was wondering that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=64.28s)]
*  Isn't that kind of G? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=65.48s)]
*  I was wondering that too. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=66.2s)]
*  Hiroshima and Nagasaki. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=67.2s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=68.92s)]
*  Now you're talking. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=69.92s)]
*  Now you're talking. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=70.76s)]
*  It is different. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=72.52s)]
*  What she's working with is different. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=73.88s)]
*  How do you get natural to bigot? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=75.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=77.28s)]
*  Have you ever gone to a farmer's market and the blueberries are big? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=77.68s)]
*  Sometimes it just happens. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=80.64s)]
*  Sometimes organically in nature, these things happen. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=82.28s)]
*  That's not a J-bone right there, son. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=86.12s)]
*  That right there, I think, my suspicion, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=87.96s)]
*  I think that's what happens when you're happy. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=92.56s)]
*  I think that's what happens when you're happy. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=95.56s)]
*  I think that they're in love. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=97.0s)]
*  I think that they have a positive, beautiful relationship. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  And I think when women are happy, their tits get bigger. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=100.88s)]
*  I bet you could even research that. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=102.75999999999999s)]
*  All right, I'll look it up. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=104.16s)]
*  It seems like women with big breasts are happier, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=105.36s)]
*  but it's not necessarily that their happiness [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=108.16s)]
*  is making their breasts bigger. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=110.08s)]
*  Chicken or the egg, dude? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  And for large breasts, you make men happier. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=112.75999999999999s)]
*  So it seems like it goes cross gender. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=115.12s)]
*  Now, let me ask you this question based on that fact that you just brought up. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=117.56s)]
*  Knowing that women are happier with big breasts. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=121.84s)]
*  Is there a, like, for example, let's say you're chronically depressed. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=126.84s)]
*  The government will step in, right? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=132.52s)]
*  And they will provide you with medication. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=135.24s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=138.56s)]
*  In many European countries. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=139.2s)]
*  And universal health care. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=141.16s)]
*  No, no, this is the now we're on to something. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=143.79999999999998s)]
*  Let me cook. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=145.95999999999998s)]
*  I'm cooking. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=146.72s)]
*  I'm cooking. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=147.48s)]
*  I like it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=148.0s)]
*  Let me cook. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=148.67999999999998s)]
*  I'm cooking. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=149.16s)]
*  Let him go. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  The government will step in if you are from a European country that has, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=151.04s)]
*  you know, nationalized health care, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  and they will provide you with a pharmaceutical grade pill, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=155.88s)]
*  actual drugs to make you happier. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  If we knew that there was another way to increase happiness, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=163.23999999999998s)]
*  that not only increase your happiness, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=168.28s)]
*  but increased your husband's happiness. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=170.6s)]
*  Second hand happiness. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=173.88s)]
*  The community's happiness. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=174.88s)]
*  See, tits bouncing around. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=176.12s)]
*  It's you're happy. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=177.56s)]
*  Everybody's happy. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=178.16s)]
*  Would it not be beneficial for a modern progressive society to, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  uh, to support breast augmentation with tax dollars? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=185.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=190.68s)]
*  Mmm. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=191.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=192.12s)]
*  I'm just saying, if we're willing to give people. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=192.84s)]
*  It's a happiness tax. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=194.8s)]
*  SSRIs, right? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=195.76s)]
*  We're willing to give people SSRIs who battle depression, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=196.88s)]
*  and it works. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=199.4s)]
*  It makes their lives better. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=200.28s)]
*  It makes all of our lives better. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  Might even increase GDP. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=202.36s)]
*  Talk to me. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=204.04s)]
*  All the women in the country have large breasts, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=204.44s)]
*  and they're able to earn more. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=206.04s)]
*  Because I'm pretty sure women with larger cup sizes do earn more money. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=207.28s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  Then the whole country is now making more money. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=210.72s)]
*  I don't know if they earn more. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=213.08s)]
*  I know they spend less. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=214.24s)]
*  They what? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=216.36s)]
*  They don't have to buy. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=216.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=218.2s)]
*  That's also true. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=219.68s)]
*  They do earn more. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=221.16s)]
*  Imagine, I know it sucks that we're going to reduce this to, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=222.04s)]
*  you know, people working at strip clubs, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=224.68s)]
*  but the girls with the bigger breasts are definitely making more money. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=226.2s)]
*  There's more places to put the money. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=231.2s)]
*  Have you ever tried to put money in a girl's flat? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=231.95999999999998s)]
*  You're just like, I don't know what. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=233.95999999999998s)]
*  I can give it to her friend. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=235.39999999999998s)]
*  I'll be like, give it to her later. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=236.28s)]
*  There's just nowhere. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=237.23999999999998s)]
*  I'll be like, Mark, just make a ball out of it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm going to chuck it out. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=240.0s)]
*  Throw it in her head. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=240.79999999999998s)]
*  He said, you were crazy. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=241.48s)]
*  I would never do that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=242.88s)]
*  Incredibly disrespectful. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=243.67999999999998s)]
*  I would never do that. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=244.6s)]
*  That was in the one strip club where they banged the beer cans with their tits. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=246.44s)]
*  No, even at night. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=250.67999999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=251.95999999999998s)]
*  That was at the Good One. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=252.44s)]
*  Now you're bringing up another strip club where you're disrespectful to women. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=253.6s)]
*  That one's a part of it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=257.08s)]
*  The Claremont Lounge is a part of it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=258.12s)]
*  You didn't do that at Claremont. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=259.96s)]
*  I did do that at Claremont. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=261.03999999999996s)]

*  From the top right. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=505.96s)]
*  I see dead people whisper, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=506.68s)]

*  Mr. Beast. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=511.16s)]
*  If HOT2AGIRL goes down on Mr. Beast, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=512.44s)]
*  and shows us what she can actually do on OnlyFans, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=515.0s)]

*  Mr. Beast, do you want it or not? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=534.36s)]
*  Jimmy, stop messing around. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=537.0s)]
*  You got in shape for what reason? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=538.92s)]
*  That's true. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=540.44s)]
*  You know, you started lifting the weights for what reason? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=541.4s)]
*  That's true. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=543.48s)]

*  Do it for the people. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=559.8000000000001s)]
*  This is what the people need. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=560.6s)]
*  And if he don't want it, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=561.88s)]
*  let his friend, the little elven-looking one, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=562.76s)]
*  let him get that. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=564.5200000000001s)]
*  Oh, that kid is so cute. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=565.08s)]
*  Nolan, right? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=567.8000000000001s)]

*  I don't want to see Nolan come. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=573.5600000000001s)]
*  I feel like Nolan comes Dunkaroos cream. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=575.48s)]
*  Nolan don't got sperm, bro. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=582.2s)]
*  He got frosting. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=583.96s)]
*  I don't believe Nolan has come, man. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=586.36s)]

*  I watched Kendrick's whole thing. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=831.0s)]
*  Before we get into discussing the whole concert, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=832.52s)]
*  has Drake ever been down this bad? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=839.4s)]
*  Never even close. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=841.48s)]
*  I thought it would just go away. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=844.52s)]
*  Yeah, the concert reignited. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=846.5999999999999s)]
*  Just seeing all those people. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=848.4399999999999s)]
*  Also, the cosign from the famous people. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=850.04s)]
*  Oh, dog. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=852.4399999999999s)]
*  When he shouted out YG and Family Matters, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=853.4s)]
*  I'm obviously a Drake hater, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=857.4s)]
*  but everybody's saying that's the best song. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=858.52s)]
*  People who love Drake are like, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=860.12s)]
*  that's the best song in the whole dis. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=861.0s)]
*  You're going to listen to it now, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=862.44s)]
*  and one of the first few bars is, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=863.4s)]
*  you know who really banged a set? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=864.92s)]
*  My N-word YG. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=866.52s)]
*  And then YG is dancing on your fucking grave at the concert. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=867.96s)]
*  You're never going to listen to that song the same. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=872.04s)]
*  And that's the only song he was proud of. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=874.6s)]
*  I think it's the only one he didn't take down, right? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=877.4s)]
*  Or did he take down all of them? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=879.64s)]
*  No, I think he only took down the hard part. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=881.16s)]
*  No, apparently he took down more. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=883.16s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=884.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=885.0s)]
*  Oh, I didn't see that. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=885.4s)]
*  No, he took only, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=886.44s)]
*  initially he took down the Tupac shit. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=887.24s)]
*  And then I think he also took, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=889.16s)]
*  he took down the AI track. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=890.44s)]
*  But I thought that was for legal reasons. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=894.7600000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=896.36s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=896.84s)]
*  That's why. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=897.1600000000001s)]
*  Now he's like, apparently he's taken a few down. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=897.72s)]
*  Really? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=900.6800000000001s)]
*  But yeah, point is, it's just, he's never been close to down. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=901.08s)]
*  Is that a true thing or an Akash truth? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=904.6800000000001s)]
*  Might be an Akash truth. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=907.1600000000001s)]
*  I'm starting to think it's an Akash. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=909.5600000000001s)]
*  I know the Tupac one he definitely took down, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=910.44s)]
*  but the other ones, I'm not sure that he took them down. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=912.36s)]
*  Push-ups are still up. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=914.6s)]
*  Those are the ones I can see on Spotify. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=916.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so maybe. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=920.8399999999999s)]
*  Push-ups and then Family Matters. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=921.88s)]
*  Was there, it was push-ups, Family Matters, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=923.4799999999999s)]
*  was there one more, it was the response to? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=925.16s)]
*  Hard part six. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=927.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he did one more after Not Like Us. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=928.76s)]
*  Yeah, hard part six. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=931.88s)]
*  And he took that down? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=933.0s)]
*  Oh, so he did take it. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=934.5999999999999s)]
*  So this is, I don't know if this is real or not, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=935.7199999999999s)]
*  but Drake deletes all Kendrick Lamar diss songs? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=937.7199999999999s)]
*  Question mark. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=940.4399999999999s)]
*  So it definitely, people were theorizing that it happened. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=940.92s)]
*  So do we know if hard part six is still up? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=944.52s)]
*  It appears not. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=946.84s)]
*  It looks like he, it's not on Spotify, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=947.56s)]
*  it's up as like a podcast. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=949.16s)]
*  It's like someone else uploaded it, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=950.68s)]
*  but it's not on his like official account. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=952.68s)]
*  Wow. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=955.48s)]
*  And I think he pulled it off Instagram. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=955.64s)]
*  Wow. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=957.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=958.52s)]
*  Wow. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=959.64s)]
*  Drake's down bad. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=960.52s)]
*  I agree. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=962.6s)]
*  But I feel like he's a hit away from being back. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=964.4399999999999s)]
*  I don't. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=966.52s)]
*  I don't. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=968.1999999999999s)]
*  Like this has changed the climate. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=968.68s)]
*  It changed how people. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=970.6s)]
*  Drake will always sell records. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=971.4s)]
*  Drake is a pop star. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=972.84s)]
*  To be fair, that's what Kendrick said. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=974.2s)]
*  I like you as keep making me dance, waving my hands. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=975.72s)]
*  But as a rapper, greatest ever to me as like, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=979.08s)]
*  maybe I'm applying too many comic rules to it, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=982.6800000000001s)]
*  but if you don't write your own stuff, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=984.52s)]
*  automatically you're not. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=986.6s)]
*  But people were still putting them there. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=988.0400000000001s)]
*  Now I don't think they do. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=989.88s)]
*  I just don't think there's anything you can really say except I like him. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=991.64s)]
*  That makes him the best. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=994.9200000000001s)]
*  And he's definitely not done. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=996.52s)]
*  His career is not done. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=997.72s)]
*  You can sell crazy. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=998.84s)]
*  I think he needs to take a little break. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=999.88s)]
*  Don't put out anything for the rest of the year. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1002.1999999999999s)]
*  Dude, he put out a song, I think a few days ago, I think. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1003.56s)]
*  Wagwon Delilah. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1005.4799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1006.68s)]
*  Wagwon Delilah was a thing. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1006.92s)]
*  No, he danced with Camila Cabello or whatever. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1008.12s)]
*  Really? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1010.4399999999999s)]
*  That's what Grand Wizard said. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1011.0799999999999s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1012.1999999999999s)]
*  I saw, I know he did the feature on Sexy Rest. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1012.68s)]
*  I don't know if he put it out. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1014.52s)]
*  I think that they were saying he was gonna drop. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1015.88s)]
*  Drops are fair enough. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1018.1999999999999s)]
*  Take a break. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1019.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think he should take a break. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1020.28s)]
*  Wow. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1022.3599999999999s)]
*  Him and Cole. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1023.88s)]
*  Cause. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1025.24s)]
*  I saw Cole on the street. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1025.8799999999999s)]
*  Really? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1027.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1028.04s)]
*  Whereabouts? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1028.76s)]
*  Here? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1029.8s)]
*  Yeah, no, yeah. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1030.3s)]
*  Walking down. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1032.1399999999999s)]
*  How are you looking? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1033.4199999999998s)]
*  Peaceful? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1034.46s)]
*  Fine. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1035.1s)]
*  Tall. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1035.82s)]
*  Peace intact. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1038.06s)]
*  On a bike or just walking? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1039.58s)]
*  Walking. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1041.58s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1042.3s)]
*  Yeah, just walking. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1042.78s)]
*  Doug. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1043.82s)]
*  So, you know, by himself loved that. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1044.3799999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1046.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I love that. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1047.02s)]
*  But also that's what he's protecting by not being involved in this. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1048.22s)]
*  Well, apparently Schoolboy Q also. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1051.82s)]
*  Drake can't walk around, sorry to cut, but like Drake can't walk around by himself. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1053.5s)]
*  Yeah, but I just feel like J. Cole's so big of an artist where he'll get stopped crazy. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1057.8999999999999s)]
*  He's always been like this. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1063.02s)]
*  Getting stopped is different than being threatened. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1063.98s)]
*  Oh yeah, I don't think he has anything to worry about. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1069.1799999999998s)]
*  But that's what he's protecting, like by not engaging in the beef. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1071.02s)]
*  Like you could mess with some people that are friends with this guy and, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1073.74s)]
*  you know, they want to make Kendrick feel like he's the man. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1077.1799999999998s)]
*  They might be tangentially related. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1081.5s)]
*  They're like, yo, I'm gonna bang on Cole. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1083.1799999999998s)]
*  Gotcha. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1085.26s)]
*  And I respect that, like saving that piece, like saving your soul. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1086.46s)]
*  Well, apparently Schoolboy Q told him before that Cole, whatever. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1090.78s)]
*  It's gonna get messy. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1094.3s)]
*  He was like, don't do this. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1095.1s)]
*  Yeah, I just thought that was cool. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1098.1399999999999s)]
*  I mean, it worked out well, like yeah, very well. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1101.1799999999998s)]
*  And now I remember early on I was like, do Kendrick take on both of these guys? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1103.4199999999998s)]
*  And now I'm like, Kendrick could have taken on both of these guys. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1107.4199999999998s)]
*  Easily. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1109.82s)]
*  Probably. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1110.78s)]
*  My respect. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1111.34s)]
*  Look, I was never the biggest Kendrick fan and I'm not. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1112.54s)]
*  I loved him as like, I loved Control. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1114.86s)]
*  I love that he wanted to be the best, but I also knew his music was not for, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1117.02s)]
*  he's for his culture. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1120.54s)]
*  God bless. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1121.74s)]
*  But I'm not gonna like be this huge stan of it just because it's not for me. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1122.3799999999999s)]
*  I love what you're doing. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1126.3799999999999s)]
*  I'm not gonna participate in it. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1127.6599999999999s)]
*  You don't even care if I do. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1128.62s)]
*  But the way he moved in this, my respect for him is through a fucking roof. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1129.82s)]
*  Unbelievable the way he navigated this whole thing. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1134.2199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1136.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, strategy wise. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1136.6999999999998s)]
*  So if you're still like, if you're, let's say you're still banging for Drake. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1137.8999999999999s)]
*  You just love Drake right now. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1142.94s)]
*  What is the angle? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1146.46s)]
*  Here's what they're saying. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1148.22s)]
*  Kendrick needed Drake to stay relevant. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1149.5s)]
*  He was irrelevant, but that's not really true because I was looking into this. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1151.26s)]
*  Apparently the Mr. Morale tour that we all thought was his flop album [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1155.26s)]
*  is one of the biggest hip hop tours of all time. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1158.3s)]
*  I think at the time it was the biggest. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1160.22s)]
*  Maybe Drake took it this time. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1161.5800000000002s)]
*  So he didn't need you to stay relevant. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1164.06s)]
*  He just, I think he's hated him for years and was like, this is the time. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1165.98s)]
*  But like, what do you do? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1170.78s)]
*  Our boys, we have boys that love Drake and they're riding for Drake. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1172.46s)]
*  I'm still a Drake fan. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1177.02s)]
*  I'm still going to enjoy the music. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1178.54s)]
*  Keeps it solid. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1180.06s)]
*  They love Drake and they're riding for him so hard. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1183.34s)]
*  You want that loyalty. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1185.74s)]
*  I imagine as someone who puts out content, I want people to ride for me like that. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1186.78s)]
*  That shit means the world. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1193.5s)]
*  But is there ever a conversation where it's just like, okay, this is an L [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1196.14s)]
*  and we're just throwing more salt by continuing to like kind of bring things up. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1201.1s)]
*  Maybe we just need to pivot, move away. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1206.78s)]
*  You're not going to change any hearts or minds anymore. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1209.8999999999999s)]
*  People have made their decision on who won this. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1212.06s)]
*  So by continuing to like bring things up and throw salt, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1214.3s)]
*  not on the wound, but just like illuminate it. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1218.2199999999998s)]
*  You might just continue to be reminding people, oh, Drake took this out. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1221.74s)]
*  Maybe it'd be smarter to just kill a story with another story. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1225.58s)]
*  Meaning if Drake's doing some other cool shit, highlight that. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1229.1s)]
*  Oh, he's producing this movie. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1232.62s)]
*  Oh, here's this new song. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1234.2199999999998s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1235.8999999999999s)]
*  Stop getting out of the, I'm going to tarnish Kendrick any way I can. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1236.54s)]
*  There was that whole thing everybody was talking about the bots. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1242.2199999999998s)]
*  That also apparently wasn't real. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1245.98s)]
*  Okay, let's say it was real or it wasn't real. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1247.5s)]
*  The song slaps. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1249.34s)]
*  You look at the concert, you go, it's not bots. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1252.3799999999999s)]
*  The concert sold out. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1254.54s)]
*  It's probably a combination of what Russ said. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1256.7s)]
*  When you have a song that's already taken off. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1259.42s)]
*  You didn't play it. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1262.46s)]
*  I 100% think they did it. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1264.22s)]
*  I 100% think as Russ said, all these artists do it. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1265.58s)]
*  But even if it was proven that it was done for this amount, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1270.86s)]
*  it doesn't stop the song from being a cultural institution. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1275.18s)]
*  The bots ain't making it a cultural institution. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1278.46s)]
*  The music being a bot made it that. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1280.3s)]
*  You can put as many bots as you want behind all of Drake's disses towards Kendrick. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1282.62s)]
*  Kendrick still wins. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1287.02s)]
*  Those people that you say are Drake riders and they're still kind of [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1288.78s)]
*  flaming, adding fuel to the flame. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1293.1799999999998s)]
*  It's almost like the people in Democratic Party are like, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1296.06s)]
*  yo, look how alert Biden is. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1298.54s)]
*  They're trying to try to lie and then you just remind us how not to. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1300.6999999999998s)]
*  Tell us something else Biden did. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1306.4599999999998s)]
*  Tell us about the reform. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1307.8999999999999s)]
*  That's the angle. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1309.6599999999999s)]
*  And these are the homies. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1310.78s)]
*  But I'm just like, and you want people to ride for you that hard. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1312.38s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1316.94s)]
*  When you go through troubled times, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1318.6200000000001s)]
*  the fact that there are people out here that are fighting for you and protecting you, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1321.3400000000001s)]
*  that's the most amazing thing in the fucking world. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1325.18s)]
*  Because it's easy to like someone when they're on top. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1328.46s)]
*  Drake is obviously experiencing this right now. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1330.38s)]
*  When he's on top, everybody's like, oh, the boy, the great, da, da, da. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1332.3000000000002s)]
*  And then he goes through this and now most people are like, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1334.78s)]
*  oh, Kendrick's the fucking man, blah, blah, blah. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1336.94s)]
*  And then you have your real core fans that are riding for you. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1338.78s)]
*  But I think that the battle is lost. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1341.74s)]
*  Elevate in other ways. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1346.94s)]
*  To that point. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1349.74s)]
*  What's that? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1350.78s)]
*  Kill the story with a story. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1351.26s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1352.14s)]
*  To that point, I think this concert is crazy either way, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1352.6200000000001s)]
*  but you could make the point that academics, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1356.8600000000001s)]
*  grandee, all these guys constantly trying to say Drake won, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1359.66s)]
*  gave it just enough life that it carried into the concert. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1362.7s)]
*  And now we got momentum going into the concert. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1366.14s)]
*  Whereas if everybody's kind of left it alone, the concert happens. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1368.22s)]
*  It's still going to be a historic moment, all that. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1370.7s)]
*  But not like you could argue this added again, like you said, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1372.38s)]
*  fuel to it where it just blew up even more. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1376.14s)]
*  I'll be honest with you, bro. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1377.74s)]
*  I thought this shit was done. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1379.26s)]
*  I thought we were moving on. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1380.46s)]
*  It was over. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1381.5800000000002s)]
*  That concert reignited itself. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1382.22s)]
*  Was there ever been a diss concert before? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1385.18s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1387.02s)]
*  It was unbelievable. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1388.46s)]
*  I love you so much. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1389.42s)]
*  This concert. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1390.06s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1391.26s)]
*  This was crazy. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1391.98s)]
*  This was nuts. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1392.94s)]
*  And now this music, sorry, go. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1393.82s)]
*  Every different gang is on stage, like uniting the gangs in Compton. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1395.02s)]
*  All the celebrities and shit. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1399.34s)]
*  It was like a real moment for LA. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1400.78s)]
*  It felt we're not even only LA, just like West Coast music. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1403.34s)]
*  It was almost as if they felt like not recognized for years. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1407.66s)]
*  They hadn't been that relevant outside of Kendrick. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1410.94s)]
*  Kendrick says it. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1413.66s)]
*  He was like, yo, LA hasn't been the same since Kobe died. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1414.3s)]
*  Since Nipsey died. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1417.74s)]
*  Since Nipsey died. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1418.7s)]
*  So it's like they have probably felt like something's been missing. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1419.5s)]
*  And this was the spark that they needed. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1423.26s)]
*  Like vengeance. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1425.66s)]
*  Because they used to be, and I heard somebody say this, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1426.94s)]
*  remember there was a time where almost every song on the radio was a mustard beat? [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1429.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1433.74s)]
*  They had a crazy run. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1434.62s)]
*  It was game and then mustard came right after and they were on a crazy run. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1437.02s)]
*  So it was in a lot of ways a perfect storm. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1443.18s)]
*  But yeah. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1448.54s)]
*  Imagine being Drake. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1450.3s)]
*  Imagine being Drake on Juneteenth. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1452.86s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1454.3s)]
*  I bet you he's calling all his friends just to make sure he's not hearing that concert [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1454.86s)]
*  playing in the background. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1458.06s)]
*  Yo, I'm just calling to check it out. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1460.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean, yeah, dude. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1463.82s)]
*  I thought all the songs that Kendrick dropped are good in the diss. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1466.3799999999999s)]
*  Euphoria to open with was crazy. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1469.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he set the tone. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1471.82s)]
*  To open with is just fucking crazy. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1473.8999999999999s)]
*  And then he plays every song and other people pointed this out, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1476.3799999999999s)]
*  but he played songs you didn't realize he's talking about Drake. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1478.86s)]
*  But he was talking about Drake. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1482.2199999999998s)]
*  Use a bitch your hormones, probably switch inside your DNA. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1484.6200000000001s)]
*  You keep listening to that. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1487.5s)]
*  You're like, oh, I think he's talking about Drake. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1488.3000000000002s)]
*  And then there's another song I think where he talks about like, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1490.6200000000001s)]
*  you're going to come to my city without checking in with me. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1493.3400000000001s)]
*  Whatever the fuck element I think is called or something. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1496.5400000000002s)]
*  But like, when Drake filled that video in Compton, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1498.6200000000001s)]
*  that was his sub back to Drake about that. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1501.02s)]
*  He played songs specifically that had a lot of songs that had Drake subs in them. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1503.1000000000001s)]
*  And now you're listening to them and you're like, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1507.26s)]
*  oh, this guy's been talking to Drake for years. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1508.7s)]
*  So this is this is really interesting to me. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1512.1399999999999s)]
*  The concert goes crazy. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1515.8999999999999s)]
*  He's filming the music video. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1518.62s)]
*  The music video is going to go fucking. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1520.9399999999998s)]
*  It's going to be the summer. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1522.62s)]
*  It's usually Drake time. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1525.1799999999998s)]
*  Is now at least the beginning of it completely Kendrick [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1528.6999999999998s)]
*  and he's going to be able to milk and push this. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1533.5s)]
*  I mean, if Kendrick drops an album this summer. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1536.06s)]
*  Yeah, this is his year. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1538.62s)]
*  Imagine he drops an album this summer. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1539.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1543.82s)]
*  What is Drake going to do? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1544.54s)]
*  You can't just drop a little single that's not going to squash. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1545.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1548.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1548.94s)]
*  And also the pressure on the single that Drake drops is monumental. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1549.26s)]
*  If you drop and flop. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1553.26s)]
*  The pressure on both on Drake and Cole right now. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1556.06s)]
*  There's so much pressure. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1558.94s)]
*  I don't even think people thinking about Cole. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1560.38s)]
*  Some they are looking when he put that song out. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1562.54s)]
*  They were making fun of him. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1564.94s)]
*  But people always make fun of him. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1565.98s)]
*  They always say, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1567.18s)]
*  I like that. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1567.58s)]
*  But it's not the same. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1568.62s)]
*  There's pressure on him. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1570.3799999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1571.1799999999998s)]
*  This is not Mark. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1571.6599999999999s)]
*  There's pressure on him. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1574.3799999999999s)]
*  But if you clown it, people are just like, yeah, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1575.1s)]
*  but he stepped away from the battle. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1576.62s)]
*  Like, what are you really going to say? [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1577.8999999999999s)]
*  Drake called for this. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1579.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1580.3799999999999s)]
*  And then when Kendrick wasn't dropping kept calling for it. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1580.78s)]
*  No, no, no, you following through. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1584.06s)]
*  He made it worse because like during the battle, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1585.58s)]
*  he's like, I get more love in LA than you. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1587.1s)]
*  And then Kendrick showed up. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1588.78s)]
*  That was another thing. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1589.82s)]
*  And everything backfired. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1590.62s)]
*  Who got who gets way more love. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1591.58s)]
*  That was nuts. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1593.82s)]
*  Having Drake come out. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1594.62s)]
*  Son, the ICD-P. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1596.38s)]
*  That was bonkers. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1598.46s)]
*  A little tone, death death. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1601.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1602.86s)]
*  There's some allegations against Dr. Dre that that was one thought [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1603.5s)]
*  I think a lot of us had. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1606.7s)]
*  It's like, this is really fun. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1607.82s)]
*  But if we're going to, if abuse is being thrown around, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1609.42s)]
*  Dre's probably not. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1614.54s)]
*  See what Ice Cube is doing. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1615.98s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1617.26s)]
*  That was a little. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1621.26s)]
*  I know Snoop is on tour. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1622.14s)]
*  Hey, Cube, you here? [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1623.34s)]
*  I'd love for you to handle this for me. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1625.74s)]
*  No Vaseline and all. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1627.18s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1628.22s)]
*  Do no Vaseline. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1629.1s)]
*  That would have been crazy. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1629.98s)]
*  But yeah, I was curious to see the people who weren't there, though. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1632.14s)]
*  OK. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1634.86s)]
*  Because when he said it, when he announced the tour, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1635.58s)]
*  he was like, oh, it's going to be Kendrick and friends. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1637.26s)]
*  So everybody's speculating. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1638.7s)]
*  Oh, who is he going to bring? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1639.82s)]
*  People are speculating. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1640.94s)]
*  Oh, he'll bring out Rihanna and all these like big name people. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1642.3s)]
*  And I would have definitely thought Snoop would be there, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1645.26s)]
*  but Snoop's on tour. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1647.26s)]
*  Couldn't make it. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1648.14s)]
*  But Game not being there surprised me. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1649.18s)]
*  Do they not beef? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1651.82s)]
*  Well, I think Game beefed with Dre. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1653.5s)]
*  And then also Game was kind of like Drake is my homie during this thing. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1656.3s)]
*  And I think Kendrick, I thought initially people on Twitter, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1660.62s)]
*  quick to correct me, but I thought initially he didn't have Snoop up there for that reason. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1663.5s)]
*  That Snoop wasn't like, why the fuck are you using AI, my voice and AI? [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1666.62s)]
*  But apparently he was just on tour. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1671.6599999999999s)]
*  But I think Kendrick was like, if you're playing both sides and we're not doing that, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1673.26s)]
*  this ain't that time. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1677.82s)]
*  Mustard is coming out. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1679.1s)]
*  We're going to let everyone know where your loyalties lie. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1680.3s)]
*  You're going to shout out YG in the song. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1682.14s)]
*  Let's see what time it is. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1684.38s)]
*  YG's on this fucking stage. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1685.5s)]
*  LeBron was there. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1687.66s)]
*  Dog, that was the nail in the coffin. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1688.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1691.8200000000002s)]
*  I mean, as long as LeBron wasn't on stage, that says something. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1693.5800000000002s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1698.14s)]
*  Because like I even wanted to be at the show. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1698.8600000000001s)]
*  Who was on stage that was in LA? [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1700.6200000000001s)]
*  I think that was also by design. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1702.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1704.38s)]
*  Who was on stage that wasn't West Coast at least? [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1704.5400000000002s)]
*  Truthfully, we don't know all those people, but we're just assuming that they're not. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1706.8600000000001s)]
*  I mean, the way he's saying it is this is every section coming out, every gang. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1709.98s)]
*  We're all uniting on this stage. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1714.3s)]
*  Russell Westbrook is LA. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1715.98s)]
*  Fucking Damar DeRozan. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1718.06s)]
*  That was brilliant too. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1719.02s)]
*  I'm glad DeRozan came home. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1721.18s)]
*  Y'all didn't deserve him neither. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1722.38s)]
*  Yep. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1723.42s)]
*  That was also your homie. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1723.9s)]
*  Remember they were in a sketch together. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1724.8600000000001s)]
*  Drake and Damar DeRozan. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1726.14s)]
*  Damar is up there dancing. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1727.5s)]
*  I mean, everybody. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1729.74s)]
*  I was surprised Wack100 isn't there. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1730.8600000000001s)]
*  He's supposedly this guy who was super tapped into gang culture in LA. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1733.1s)]
*  And surprised he wasn't there. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1737.5s)]
*  There's certain people where it's like they were left out and I think it just shows LA [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1740.94s)]
*  doesn't really fuck with them. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1745.34s)]
*  Oh shit. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1746.94s)]
*  You're saying you don't think LA fucks with Wack? [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1748.38s)]
*  I don't think they fuck with Wack. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1750.8600000000001s)]
*  I don't think they fuck with Game. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1751.74s)]
*  Because they do like a lot of silly shit where it's like people are just like, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1752.94s)]
*  ah, you're doing too much. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1757.82s)]
*  And I think it got to the point where it's just like, yo, you over there. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1759.34s)]
*  I'm so detached. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1763.5s)]
*  I was never attached. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1766.14s)]
*  I know so little that I basically assume the loudest voices are the most connected [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1767.42s)]
*  with things that I don't know much about. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1773.3400000000001s)]
*  So since he's such an ambassador for LA gang culture, Wack, I'm like, oh, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1776.8600000000001s)]
*  he must be one of the top OGs out there. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1781.8200000000002s)]
*  But you're saying that, wow, that's interesting. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1784.78s)]
*  You would have to be in the building the way he talks about how he's connected with the gangs. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1788.54s)]
*  That's really interesting. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1793.26s)]
*  Did you talk to Taylor at all? [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1795.5800000000002s)]
*  Did she go? [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1797.18s)]
*  She did go. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1798.1399999999999s)]
*  I didn't talk to her. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1798.78s)]
*  Oh, I would love to know, dude. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1799.42s)]
*  I'm dying to know. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1800.62s)]
*  Brilliant's going to be fired this week. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1801.42s)]
*  Dude, that's crazy. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1802.7s)]
*  You watched it live. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1803.58s)]
*  Did you watch it live? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1804.3s)]
*  No. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1805.02s)]
*  You didn't watch it live. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1805.74s)]
*  I just saw the clips. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1806.22s)]
*  Doing it live is so smart, though. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1807.18s)]
*  Oh, incredible. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1808.54s)]
*  And it was so good. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1809.42s)]
*  Son, I had a spot, so I missed some of his concert. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1810.46s)]
*  I'm coming home. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1812.78s)]
*  I'm texting my wife. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1813.66s)]
*  Turn on fucking Amazon right now. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1815.5s)]
*  Like, I'm coming home. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1817.98s)]
*  I'm not missing any of it. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1819.02s)]
*  You need to see what's happening right now. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1820.22s)]
*  It was after I see dead people. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1821.74s)]
*  Everybody goes crazy. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1823.8999999999999s)]
*  Then he just stops after the first verse. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1825.02s)]
*  And then y'all gonna let him disrespect our heroes. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1827.26s)]
*  Bah bah bah. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1829.42s)]
*  Hits it again. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1830.22s)]
*  Doesn't. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1831.1s)]
*  Barely raps a fucking word. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1831.74s)]
*  The whole crowd raps. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1833.26s)]
*  The whole thing. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1834.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1835.1s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1835.58s)]
*  And then just do it again and again and again. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1836.06s)]
*  Did you think the outfit was on purpose? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1838.7s)]
*  I didn't know if the outfit... [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1840.62s)]
*  My initial reading... [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1842.1399999999999s)]
*  Definitely on purpose. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1842.86s)]
*  Were you using a cock homage, you thought? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1843.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1845.18s)]
*  It was cocked during the 94th Source Awards. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1845.58s)]
*  She had the same outfit. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1848.1399999999999s)]
*  And is that the Source Awards where Snoop went up there [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1849.1s)]
*  and was like, we know y'all East Coast. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1851.34s)]
*  We know where we are. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1852.62s)]
*  It might have been that one. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1853.74s)]
*  If that... [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1855.02s)]
*  Then that makes sense. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1855.5s)]
*  Because then that was like a West Coast, East Coast thing. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1856.86s)]
*  I initially thought the outfit being simple was like another shot at... [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1859.74s)]
*  Drake is not... [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1864.78s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1865.66s)]
*  Not one of us. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1866.14s)]
*  Drake has the most... [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1866.78s)]
*  It's almost... [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1867.9s)]
*  The outfit's almost identical. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1869.42s)]
*  Oh, the feelers. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1870.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1871.9s)]
*  That's where I was like, why didn't you just go feelers? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1873.1s)]
*  Go all the way through. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1874.86s)]
*  I know. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1875.34s)]
*  Yeah, that was weird. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1875.58s)]
*  90 Shocks is so funny. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1876.3s)]
*  That somebody was like, I searched for those on Twitter. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1878.6200000000001s)]
*  Or on Google and my phone blew up or something like that. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1880.94s)]
*  Nike Shocks immediately on StockX, like 2X. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1883.74s)]
*  They were great shoes. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1887.66s)]
*  I don't know why that's not making it. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1888.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1889.34s)]
*  Because you saw people claiming it was a hotline bling. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1889.66s)]
*  That I believe. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1891.98s)]
*  It's too similar. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1893.26s)]
*  The dance that he did as he did the A minor. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1894.3s)]
*  It's even the leg shake. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1897.9s)]
*  That's when I was like, oh, this is intentional. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1899.42s)]
*  Kendrick is doing the leg shake with it. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1901.26s)]
*  I didn't catch that one. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1902.86s)]
*  That's good. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1904.22s)]
*  I mean, yeah. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1905.58s)]
*  Even the chain, he doesn't usually wear chains like that, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1906.06s)]
*  but he had like this big cross. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1908.46s)]
*  And I think Pac had it on during that show. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1911.9s)]
*  And that was me. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1915.1000000000001s)]
*  That was made by Ben Baller, who's like, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1915.74s)]
*  Oh yeah, no, you're right. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1917.66s)]
*  LA legend in terms of the jewelry. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1918.7800000000002s)]
*  My initial thought was. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1920.38s)]
*  So much detail in every little aspect of that show. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1921.66s)]
*  The fun thing about applying detail to things [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1924.22s)]
*  is that people will start to look for details [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1926.3000000000002s)]
*  where you didn't even apply it. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1928.14s)]
*  Everything now has meaning. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1930.38s)]
*  When you put hidden meaning. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1932.46s)]
*  And I think that there are certain things [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1934.6200000000001s)]
*  that are in the lyrics that he didn't even mean for them to be. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1936.5400000000002s)]
*  That the critics or the reviewers have projected onto them. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1940.8600000000001s)]
*  So now it seems even more. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1945.18s)]
*  Oh, dude, the funniest one. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1946.46s)]
*  And again, I'm a guy who really respects Kendrick after this. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1947.66s)]
*  He has a line in Euphoria where he's like, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1950.38s)]
*  he's feeling like Joel Halostein or something like that. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1952.22s)]
*  And he said, funny, he was in a film called Sixth Sense. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1955.5800000000002s)]
*  He's mixing Haley Joel Osmond and Joel Austin for these reasons. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1958.46s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1961.5s)]
*  You guys don't know black people. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1962.22s)]
*  Black people don't know white people's names. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1963.3400000000001s)]
*  They get them wrong all the time. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1964.94s)]
*  He just doesn't know who the fuck is who. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1966.38s)]
*  He thinks Joel Halostein and Haley Joel Osmond are the same person. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1968.3799999999999s)]
*  What are y'all even talking about? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1971.26s)]
*  That was a fucker. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1973.4199999999998s)]
*  There's no fucking chance that's not. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1974.7s)]
*  This guy right here. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1978.1399999999999s)]
*  I want to hear it. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1979.6599999999999s)]
*  Come on, Barry, the bars planer. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1980.3799999999999s)]
*  He has a 69 guard. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1982.54s)]
*  Let's start with that one. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1985.1s)]
*  Really? [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1985.8999999999999s)]
*  And we're he asked neighbor. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1986.3799999999999s)]
*  You're a neighbor. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1987.8999999999999s)]
*  The great nine. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1988.62s)]
*  God, he a fan. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1989.4199999999998s)]
*  He a fan. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1991.34s)]
*  He a fan. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1992.1399999999999s)]
*  F.A.N. fan. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1993.18s)]
*  Freaky ass neighbor. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1995.5s)]
*  That I think we knew right. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1997.34s)]
*  It's an acronym. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=1998.62s)]
*  Certified lover boy. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2000.78s)]
*  Certified petafowl. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2002.1399999999999s)]
*  Why did he say petafowl? [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2003.74s)]
*  Not file. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2005.58s)]
*  Well, what is OVO, Sealy? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2007.02s)]
*  Petafowl. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2010.62s)]
*  Fowl. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2011.26s)]
*  Trying to strike a chord and it's probably A minor. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2014.9399999999998s)]
*  Now, the obvious breakdown. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2019.02s)]
*  A minor. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2021.26s)]
*  It's like a chord but also A minor because allegations. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2021.98s)]
*  But the deeper meaning. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2025.1s)]
*  Kendrick has called Drake a white boy. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2026.3799999999999s)]
*  Well, the A minor scale is the only minor scale that only has white keys. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2028.2199999999998s)]
*  Oh, black keys. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2033.58s)]
*  White people have a place in rap. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2037.02s)]
*  So funny. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2039.5s)]
*  Is he being serious or is this a joke? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2040.6999999999998s)]
*  Well, the fan thing is real. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2042.3s)]
*  This is the show. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2043.74s)]
*  They break down bars. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2044.6999999999998s)]
*  It's called Bar Wars. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2045.74s)]
*  That's a great name. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2048.2999999999997s)]
*  That's so wrong. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2050.94s)]
*  Yeah, so a lot of that's been happening the whole battle. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2052.22s)]
*  I thought that shit was for sure a Drake hotline bling thing. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2055.2599999999998s)]
*  I thought the outfit. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2059.5s)]
*  I, my initial read, tell me if there's anything to this. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2060.38s)]
*  He's the whole time he's saying Drake is not one of us. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2063.18s)]
*  Drake is wearing fucking octopus outfits and shit on stage. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2065.3399999999997s)]
*  And he's like, I'm going to go out there. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2068.06s)]
*  This guy dressed like a fucking Spider-Man film when he goes out on stage. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2071.3399999999997s)]
*  And Kendrick's like, I'm going out there in a hoodie and a baseball cap and jeans and sneakers. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2075.02s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2079.2599999999998s)]
*  And a chain. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2080.06s)]
*  But also it was crazy performance-wise. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2081.42s)]
*  No backing track. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2083.02s)]
*  And somebody else pointed this out. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2084.62s)]
*  He didn't drink water the whole time. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2086.62s)]
*  I can't do a 30 minute set sitting on a stool without drinking water. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2088.62s)]
*  This guy's wrapping his ass off. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2092.7799999999997s)]
*  No backing track. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2094.22s)]
*  No water. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2095.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's great. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2096.46s)]
*  So if you're, if you're on Drake's strategy team, what do you do? [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2097.1s)]
*  Take the summer off, drop an album. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2102.14s)]
*  Might need to. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2103.98s)]
*  Because here's what Kendrick also did. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2104.7s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2106.54s)]
*  One more thing. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2106.8599999999997s)]
*  He just played this. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2107.58s)]
*  He stretched this out so beautifully. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2108.62s)]
*  The Juneteenth concert was like a month and a half almost after [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2110.2999999999997s)]
*  May 4th, I think, was my birthday. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2114.38s)]
*  He dropped Not Like Us. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2115.9s)]
*  What a gift I got. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2116.94s)]
*  Month and a half. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2118.2200000000003s)]
*  He doesn't do anything. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2119.02s)]
*  Then a concert. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2119.98s)]
*  That concert's going to carry him. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2120.94s)]
*  Then he's going to drop the video. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2122.78s)]
*  They're editing the video right now. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2123.98s)]
*  This concert's going to die out. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2125.98s)]
*  He's going to drop the video. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2127.26s)]
*  Then he just takes the whole summer. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2128.78s)]
*  I could put a, I got it. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2130.46s)]
*  Don't say Hawk Toot. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2133.34s)]
*  It is that. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2134.86s)]
*  I called Drake. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2137.9s)]
*  I said. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2138.94s)]
*  I said. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2139.42s)]
*  It is. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2139.9s)]
*  He got to hook up with Hawk Toot. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2140.38s)]
*  No, no. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2141.6600000000003s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2143.12s)]
*  In all seriousness, all he needs to do is get in a relationship. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2143.68s)]
*  I mean that dead serious. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2147.92s)]
*  There's nothing that people. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2148.96s)]
*  There's nothing that music is powerful. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2151.04s)]
*  It's not as powerful as relationships. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2153.2799999999997s)]
*  Dark skinned black girl. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2155.12s)]
*  It could be. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2156.08s)]
*  Dark skinned black girl. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2157.04s)]
*  The more famous or the more intriguing the girl is, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2157.7599999999998s)]
*  if he really wants to do it, he could get in a relationship with somebody's ex. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2160.96s)]
*  The ideal scenario would be him and Kim get in a relationship. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2166.0s)]
*  Something. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2169.52s)]
*  I think we want to see growth from him. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2171.0400000000004s)]
*  Not do some shit where he's trying to get back at dudes and stuff. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2172.8s)]
*  Well, here's what I would say is like, and I don't think people, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2176.0800000000004s)]
*  in order to stop the momentum of this Kendrick thing, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2180.0800000000004s)]
*  you just need to kill it with another story. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2183.28s)]
*  That story doesn't need to be positive. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2184.96s)]
*  We don't. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2187.1200000000003s)]
*  I don't think that people like Drake's music less. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2188.96s)]
*  I think his music is phenomenal. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2191.52s)]
*  He's had two decades of unbelievably awesome music. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2192.96s)]
*  So it's not like we don't. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2196.2400000000002s)]
*  There's this other person that's more badass at rapping. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2198.7200000000003s)]
*  That's what it looks like. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2202.2400000000002s)]
*  So what you just need to do is get people talking about another thing. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2203.52s)]
*  And I think that people love relationships. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2207.04s)]
*  They love that drama. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2209.04s)]
*  We haven't seen Drake in a relationship with somebody. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2210.0s)]
*  He settles down with who names him people. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2212.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, Kim is the most obvious because there's the Kanye shakeup. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2216.0s)]
*  Kanye is going to be bitching nonstop about it. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2218.7200000000003s)]
*  Then they're going to go crazy. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2220.96s)]
*  It might be a little expected. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2222.2400000000002s)]
*  He could have a relationship with Taylor Swift. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2223.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean, if he is in a relationship with... [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2226.56s)]
*  Oh, I got another one for you. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2232.0s)]
*  You ready? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2233.36s)]
*  This shuts it down immediately. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2234.48s)]
*  Zendaya. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2237.92s)]
*  Drake dates Zendaya. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2240.24s)]
*  I don't even know. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2243.2s)]
*  I don't even think people realize... [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2244.08s)]
*  The real Spider-Man villain, like I said. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2245.6s)]
*  Yeah, there it is. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2247.12s)]
*  They not like us. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2248.16s)]
*  I don't even think people realize the music video came out. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2250.08s)]
*  If Drake is seen with Zendaya. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2253.76s)]
*  People love relationships, man. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2256.5600000000004s)]
*  They get obsessed with it. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2258.4s)]
*  All these fucking dating shows, all these housewives shows [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2259.6000000000004s)]
*  are really just about watching the drama of the relationship. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2262.5600000000004s)]
*  Imagine, did you guys see the amount of publicity [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2265.5200000000004s)]
*  that came out of that Vanderpump rules shit? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2268.7200000000003s)]
*  Nobody even knows who these people are. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2272.96s)]
*  They work at a restaurant for a living. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2274.6400000000003s)]
*  Let me just get this point out. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2276.0800000000004s)]
*  They had me watching it. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2276.8s)]
*  They're servers at a restaurant for a living on a show. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2280.4s)]
*  But people are so obsessed with relationships and drama [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2283.76s)]
*  that you'll shut down everything else that's going on in entertainment [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2287.76s)]
*  to lock your eyes on this. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2292.32s)]
*  I think Drake gets out of this relationship. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2293.92s)]
*  Yes, Oscar. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2295.6000000000004s)]
*  Another option. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2296.1600000000003s)]
*  Zendaya is in a relationship. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2297.04s)]
*  Well, that's what makes it exciting. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2298.5600000000004s)]
*  Because he's taking her from Tom Holland. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2300.2400000000002s)]
*  You just want drama. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2303.04s)]
*  You would like... [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2304.0800000000004s)]
*  Now, I don't think that this is... [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2304.88s)]
*  Yes, colonize the colonizer. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2306.0s)]
*  Yeah, go. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2307.1200000000003s)]
*  I don't think this is a good thing. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2308.1600000000003s)]
*  But what I'm suggesting is something that would stop the moment. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2309.52s)]
*  Love this Kendrick thing. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2313.68s)]
*  And you're not going to stop with music. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2314.72s)]
*  I actually don't think... [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2316.16s)]
*  Even if he comes out with the fucking amazing song, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2318.64s)]
*  I think right now the energy isn't there. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2322.16s)]
*  You ever seen people in like a roast battle? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2325.9199999999996s)]
*  And somebody says a funny joke about the other person. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2328.24s)]
*  But because the momentum or energy just isn't there, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2332.48s)]
*  you're like, that's funny on paper. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2337.52s)]
*  But we just decide that we're not with you. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2339.9199999999996s)]
*  But someone with a worst joke with the energy wins. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2341.76s)]
*  With the energy of the people. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2345.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2346.32s)]
*  Because we are on your side. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2346.6400000000003s)]
*  It's the energy of the... [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2348.32s)]
*  Like if there's something just happening [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2349.1200000000003s)]
*  that's like outside of just the words that are put together. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2350.8s)]
*  I think that's with music only it's not a worst joke. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2354.2400000000002s)]
*  Like Kendrick has great shit. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2357.2000000000003s)]
*  So I think you have to completely change what's happening. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2359.1200000000003s)]
*  You don't fight the fire with fire. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2363.2000000000003s)]
*  Fight with water. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2365.0400000000004s)]
*  And water is relationship. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2366.0s)]
*  Shakari Richardson. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2369.76s)]
*  Yeah, date Shakari Richardson would actually be crazy. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2370.88s)]
*  Especially since it's the Olympics. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2373.04s)]
*  You're out there in Paris. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2374.56s)]
*  You're watching her like... [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2375.6800000000003s)]
*  This is the fucking disgusting shit. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2377.12s)]
*  Agents and managers probably cook up all the time. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2379.12s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2381.92s)]
*  The goal is not to get people to like him. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2384.2400000000002s)]
*  That's not the goal of the relationship. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2388.0s)]
*  The goal is to get people to talk about [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2389.36s)]
*  and focus on another thing. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2392.08s)]
*  The more dramatic the relationship, the better. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2394.1600000000003s)]
*  If he dates like a likable person [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2398.0s)]
*  and is a kind of boring thing, it's even worse. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2400.08s)]
*  Because people won't talk about it enough. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2403.04s)]
*  But if he dates Michelle Obama, it's over. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2404.96s)]
*  Like nobody's even talking about Kendrick. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2409.2799999999997s)]
*  Right? [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2412.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2412.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2413.0s)]
*  Like that's... [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2413.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2414.96s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2416.56s)]
*  You gotta stir the pot. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2417.2s)]
*  And you're using it as a tool. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2419.92s)]
*  Relationships garner the most intrigue. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2422.48s)]
*  You see these couples come together. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2425.7599999999998s)]
*  There are these like people where like the guy's kind of famous. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2427.84s)]
*  The girl's kind of famous. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2430.0s)]
*  All of a sudden they cross pollinate their fans. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2430.8s)]
*  And both of them fucking skyrocket the fame. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2432.56s)]
*  Well, Taylor Swift already didn't need it. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2434.96s)]
*  But what if it's Travis Kelce? [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2436.32s)]
*  Travis and Taylor thing is a perfect example. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2437.44s)]
*  Like look at that. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2439.68s)]
*  Travis Kelce, who we all knew from football, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2440.96s)]
*  has now become the most known football player on the planet by women. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2443.36s)]
*  So that type of... [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2448.96s)]
*  So who do you date? [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2451.76s)]
*  But that's what I... [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2452.56s)]
*  Listen, if I'm Drake's handler or whatever, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2453.44s)]
*  and he's like, listen, the only thing I care about is my career. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2456.88s)]
*  And this guy's fucking up my whole career. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2458.8s)]
*  I'll do anything to save it. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2460.2400000000002s)]
*  I'd say, yeah, you need a relationship and it's gotta be fucking toxic. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2461.44s)]
*  And it's gotta be messy. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2465.04s)]
*  It's messy. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2466.8s)]
*  Like it's gotta be bad. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2467.92s)]
*  Her ex gotta be cursing on the internet. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2469.76s)]
*  Like Travis Kelce's exes were talking shit about him dating Taylor. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2471.92s)]
*  And that just amplified it. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2476.0s)]
*  Everything is. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2477.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2479.1200000000003s)]
*  That's... [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2479.92s)]
*  They took your BBL Drizzy idea. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2480.48s)]
*  So maybe we'll take this one too. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2481.92s)]
*  It's a good point. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2484.96s)]
*  You might be right with Kim because Kanye will talk. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2485.36s)]
*  Kanye's gonna go crazy. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2488.4s)]
*  Drive him nuts. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2489.6s)]
*  I mean, all the things like... [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2490.8s)]
*  Wasn't she at the Kendrick concert? [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2492.48s)]
*  No, I don't think she was, but Northwest was, which is also funny. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2494.0s)]
*  Who took Northwest? [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2497.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2498.08s)]
*  Kanye wasn't there, Kim wasn't there. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2498.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2500.48s)]
*  Show of hands. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2501.52s)]
*  And Nanny. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2502.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2502.96s)]
*  Yeah, they got some help. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2504.0s)]
*  They got some assistance. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2504.7200000000003s)]
*  That's so funny. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2505.36s)]
*  You're like, hey, Nanny, can you just take her to the concert? [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2505.92s)]
*  All right, guys, we're gonna take a break real quick so we can talk about your health. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2508.88s)]
*  And you might assume that you're getting everything your body needs from a diet [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2512.08s)]
*  or a fucking green juice. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2515.04s)]
*  But most people, myself included, are still short on essential nutrients [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2516.48s)]
*  that our body needs to function its best. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2520.48s)]
*  So I've been taking Momentous Creatine, Omega-3, and Protein every day [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2522.64s)]
*  to ensure that all my bases are covered. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2527.04s)]
*  These three supplements are the foundation of supplements. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2528.64s)]
*  This is the most important things you need. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2533.36s)]
*  It's a foundational thing for anyone trying to be healthy, [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2535.28s)]
*  whether it's aiding in cognitive function, reducing inflammation in muscles and joints, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2538.16s)]
*  bunch of other stuff. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2542.0s)]
*  These three, that's your holy trinity. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2543.12s)]
*  Momentous has become a daily thing for me, a daily staple in my health routine. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2545.04s)]
*  Supplements can feel like a dirty word because there's a bunch of charlatans out there [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2549.04s)]
*  navigating the space with products filled with a bunch of bullshit. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2553.04s)]
*  Momentous is not one of those. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2556.0s)]
*  All of their products are NSF-sport certified, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2557.6s)]
*  which means that they hold to the standard held by the NFL, the NBA, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2560.32s)]
*  a bunch of other sports teams and organizations. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2566.08s)]
*  If it's good enough for them, it's good enough for you. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2568.32s)]
*  Damn sure good enough for me. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2570.2400000000002s)]
*  And like I said, there is a reason the world's best athletes and experts [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2571.44s)]
*  use Momentous products. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2574.8s)]
*  So if you're like me and you want to take supplements that are made [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=2576.0800000000004s)]

*  I thought there was another reason I was wearing a hat. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3181.8399999999997s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3184.56s)]
*  I went in the sun for the first time in six years and I got a fucking tan halfway through [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3185.2s)]
*  my forehead. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3189.44s)]
*  So my forehead looks like Mark's normal, whereas the sun is hitting one location and then the [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3190.3199999999997s)]
*  rest it doesn't. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3196.56s)]
*  So is there an actual line right there? [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3197.2799999999997s)]
*  It's unreal. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3199.2s)]
*  The color looks great. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3199.92s)]
*  From here down, it looks great. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3200.96s)]
*  I obviously didn't wear a hat for that. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3202.3199999999997s)]
*  But it's... [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3204.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, how horrible is it? [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3206.8799999999997s)]
*  You had to wear a hat. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3208.08s)]
*  You wore a hat for that reason. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3209.04s)]
*  That is awesome. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3210.08s)]
*  And then with the cut and everything, it just... [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3210.72s)]
*  Nothing just happens from here. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3214.56s)]
*  So bad, isn't it? [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3216.24s)]
*  It's cranial. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3217.2s)]
*  In a rare way right now, dude. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3218.7999999999997s)]
*  You look like you're in rare form. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3220.48s)]
*  You look like a golfer when they win a championship. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3221.92s)]
*  They take their hat off on the 18th green and they've just got a white line. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3223.8399999999997s)]
*  Shut up, mom. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3226.7999999999997s)]
*  Why is that still going, dude? [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3228.8799999999997s)]
*  That was so long. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3230.48s)]
*  What is that about? [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3231.6s)]
*  Communication history. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3233.12s)]
*  That was a five year... [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3233.76s)]
*  Five years of communication. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3236.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3239.76s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3240.8s)]
*  Show them the funny picture, Mark. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3241.52s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3242.8s)]
*  Aha. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3243.28s)]
*  Fuck y'all. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3248.0s)]
*  Come on. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3250.56s)]
*  Roe Shambo. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3252.16s)]
*  What the fuck is that? [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3253.52s)]
*  Roe Shambo. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3254.96s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3256.32s)]
*  He got a tumor on his head. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3256.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3258.88s)]
*  What the fuck is that? [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3259.2s)]
*  What do you mean, what is that? [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3260.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3262.24s)]
*  That's why we don't mix the racist stuff. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3264.4799999999996s)]
*  Good. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3269.04s)]
*  We don't want your fucking horrible skin. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3269.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3271.2s)]
*  You need to mix it. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3272.3199999999997s)]
*  That's going to age well though. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3274.8799999999997s)]
*  You give them time with that, that's going to look good. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3275.9199999999996s)]
*  I'm telling you. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3278.56s)]
*  Wow. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3279.52s)]
*  You think? [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3280.02s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3280.4799999999996s)]
*  It's like natural Botox. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3280.56s)]
*  Nothing on your forehead. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3282.64s)]
*  Can't be a surprise for you, bro. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3285.2799999999997s)]
*  It's going to be awesome. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3286.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3287.68s)]
*  Can we have a serious fucking conversation on this podcast? [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3288.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, let's start the pod, dude. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3291.68s)]
*  All right. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3292.8799999999997s)]
*  While we're speaking of basketball, we have to speak about- [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3293.2799999999997s)]
*  Shout out. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3297.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, we have to speak about JJ. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3298.08s)]
*  Shout out to JJ. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3300.08s)]
*  Friendship. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3302.56s)]
*  JJ is a good guy. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3303.52s)]
*  We were going to play paddle all summer out in the Hamptons. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3307.3599999999997s)]
*  We had great plans to just enjoy a nice summer of paddle. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3310.0s)]
*  And then this fucking cocksuck decides to go out there [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3315.04s)]
*  and get the fucking Lakers head coaching job. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3318.7999999999997s)]
*  Very inconsiderate of him. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3321.44s)]
*  Very. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3322.7200000000003s)]
*  Very. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3324.16s)]
*  Now I have to find a new person to be part of the four for the paddle. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3325.12s)]
*  And I was ready to work this guy because he has like one fucking mozzarella string [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3330.2400000000002s)]
*  left on his Achilles. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3334.08s)]
*  And I was looking forward to this summer like hitting a nice little drop volley [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3336.2400000000002s)]
*  and having that shit pop and then just standing over him. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3340.64s)]
*  You're horrible. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3343.92s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3344.8s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3346.32s)]
*  That's a friend. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3347.68s)]
*  That's what friends do, okay? [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3349.28s)]
*  I'm going to break this guy. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3351.44s)]
*  So JJ got the Lakers job. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3354.2400000000002s)]
*  Vivek's going to be Trump's VP. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3356.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, like basically when you come on the pod. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3357.84s)]
*  You win, dog. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3359.52s)]
*  You win. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3360.32s)]
*  Wait, that was announced? [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3361.12s)]
*  No, but I just saw something. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3362.2400000000002s)]
*  Why do we believe? [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3363.44s)]
*  I think Trump is flying to Cleveland. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3364.16s)]
*  I think that's where Vivek is and that's why he's flying out there. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3365.52s)]
*  That's not good. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3368.88s)]
*  Why? [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3370.2400000000002s)]
*  Because it gives him a chance of winning? [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3370.56s)]
*  No, you saw how when he was still going, when he was still running, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3372.0s)]
*  they were like, I can't vote for you because you're brown. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3376.56s)]
*  Like so many Republicans were saying that. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3378.96s)]
*  They don't care about VP. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3380.8s)]
*  Don't vote for a brown VP. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3383.36s)]
*  They don't mind us as VPs. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3384.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3388.48s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3389.92s)]
*  He's making sense. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3390.7200000000003s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3391.6800000000003s)]
*  I agree with Akash. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3392.7200000000003s)]
*  How is he making sense? [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3395.84s)]
*  He just said, I don't know. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3396.5600000000004s)]
*  I tend to agree with Akash because if he would maybe alienate, but. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3402.8s)]
*  What is the group that Trump has not tapped into and does Vivek satisfy that group? [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3411.04s)]
*  I don't know if he does, actually. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3417.28s)]
*  I would say moderates is Vivek tapping into the mindset of the moderates. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3419.28s)]
*  Do you think? [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3423.6000000000004s)]
*  No, I think he's really extremist in his in his philosophy. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3424.0800000000004s)]
*  I think they might be disillusioned enough with Biden that they're like, [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3428.4s)]
*  OK, there's someone at least sensible in some form of it, because if you're if you're looking [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3431.1200000000003s)]
*  at both of them like they both might be a little bit senile if you're looking at them like that. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3436.32s)]
*  Then you might look at the VPs. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3440.8s)]
*  Kamala, no one likes they're going to look at Vivek and be like, well, he seems better than her. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3442.4s)]
*  He seems more competent. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3446.1600000000003s)]
*  He seems just smarter. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3447.1200000000003s)]
*  He's a man. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3448.7200000000003s)]
*  That's kind of cool. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3449.84s)]
*  A little more comfortable there. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3452.8s)]
*  You're fucking disgusting. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3454.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm not talking about the whole couch is fucking disgusting. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3455.76s)]
*  I'm just talking about the father of a daughter. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3459.2000000000003s)]
*  It really pains me to hear that disgusting talk. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3461.28s)]
*  What's the hot hot Tui girl's name? [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3464.32s)]
*  I still don't remember because she's just the hot Tui girl in your brain. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3466.0800000000004s)]
*  What's her name? [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3469.04s)]
*  Haley Welch. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3470.24s)]
*  That was really good. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3472.08s)]
*  Hold that up. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3472.72s)]
*  Yeah, you'll never forget. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3473.2s)]
*  I will never forget that girl's name because I've been searching for it for a long time. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3476.24s)]
*  OK, I've been doing a big deep dive on this girl. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3482.64s)]
*  Fucking jerk, this guy and you with your opinions on women. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3486.24s)]
*  What did I say? [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3490.0s)]
*  You said that it's better that the president is a man. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3491.12s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3494.3999999999996s)]
*  I'm not saying that out loud. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3495.7599999999998s)]
*  What I said was I think. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3497.2799999999997s)]
*  You said the vice president. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3500.16s)]
*  The casual voter would just, you know, be a little more comfortable with a man than a woman that no one seems to like. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3505.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point about Kamala. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3512.48s)]
*  She's not very likable. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3513.68s)]
*  She's very widely disliked. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3514.48s)]
*  I know you have to pretend you like her, but you don't. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3516.7999999999997s)]
*  It's when she's black. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3519.6s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3520.7999999999997s)]
*  I just said everything right there. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3521.2799999999997s)]
*  You just repeated what I said. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3522.7999999999997s)]
*  Is she black? [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3524.3999999999996s)]
*  Is Kamala black? [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3525.68s)]
*  She's black when she wants to be an Indian, when she needs to be. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3527.12s)]
*  It's like when has she been Indian? [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3529.84s)]
*  I haven't seen Indians come out. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3531.04s)]
*  It's time to run and get Indians to vote for her. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3532.16s)]
*  Then she's Indian. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3534.0s)]
*  She's very proud of it. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3535.04s)]
*  Is she the most docile, quiet Indian woman that you've ever met in your entire life? [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3536.0s)]
*  Is there another Indian woman in this position of power that literally says absolutely nothing? [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3541.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3547.84s)]
*  It's to the point where I don't think she's Indian. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3548.8s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think she's black then either. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3550.96s)]
*  I just got to agree. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3553.84s)]
*  What the fuck is this lady? [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3554.64s)]
*  She's Indian and black and presents none of them at all. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3557.12s)]
*  She's like the other Asian, I think, like a Korean, like a Korean maybe. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3562.64s)]
*  Do you think she's brown rice? [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3566.48s)]
*  She's brown rice? [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3567.84s)]
*  Do you think she's brown rice? [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3568.88s)]
*  She's sneaky brown. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3570.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3571.04s)]
*  Sneaky brown, I can see it. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3572.64s)]
*  I mean, there's something else going on here. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3574.32s)]
*  The fact that she's a black woman and an Indian woman and hasn't had a single opinion. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3576.56s)]
*  Maybe that's the blend. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3582.16s)]
*  The math is, oh, they cancel each other out. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3583.2s)]
*  That's the blend, dude. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3585.28s)]
*  Two negatives equal positive. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3586.08s)]
*  Oh my, I'm glad you said that one because I was going to call them negatives and I thought [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3588.24s)]
*  that that was not at all. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3591.36s)]
*  You can't say that, Edward. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3591.92s)]
*  I thought that. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3592.72s)]
*  I can say that, I'm half negative. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3594.72s)]
*  I like it. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3597.2799999999997s)]
*  No, you're full negative. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3599.52s)]
*  Yeah, well, you know, it worked better that way. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3600.56s)]
*  The joke just worked better. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3603.7599999999998s)]
*  Damn it, guys. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3604.7999999999997s)]
*  Was I analyzing humor again? [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3605.52s)]
*  I should do that more. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3607.44s)]
*  That sounds really fun to do on the podcast. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3608.16s)]
*  Let me just analyze all the jokes while we continue the podcast. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3610.16s)]
*  Well, you are half. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3612.88s)]
*  You're Pashtun. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3613.52s)]
*  You're mostly Pashtun. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3614.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3615.76s)]
*  Is Afghan, is that negative? [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3616.88s)]
*  See, I think Indian. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3618.4s)]
*  Indian is your half. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3619.36s)]
*  Oh, I forgot you were a dirty. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3620.32s)]
*  Yeah, my main genetics are apparently Pakistani and Pashtun. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3623.5200000000004s)]
*  I am fucking evil. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3628.96s)]
*  I like calling whites monkeys. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3632.0s)]
*  It's the best. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3633.36s)]
*  Calling white people monkeys is the best. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3634.0s)]
*  Well, let's not. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3636.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's kind of fun. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3637.6000000000004s)]
*  Because you know I'm defensive. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3639.28s)]
*  Oh, I am the best. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3642.4s)]
*  Stay on it. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3643.52s)]
*  Well, you feel the least racist. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3644.16s)]
*  There's the least racial. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3646.08s)]
*  So there's no like if I call a Sri Lankan a monkey, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3648.08s)]
*  which is funny to me, there's a little bit of. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3651.04s)]
*  Dude, you get a smirk just saying. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3652.7200000000003s)]
*  It's so funny. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3654.08s)]
*  It's such a funny thing. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3654.7200000000003s)]
*  You just said it hypothetically. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3655.6s)]
*  It's so funny. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3656.64s)]
*  And you just. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3657.52s)]
*  Asian. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3658.32s)]
*  Black people are not even doing. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3660.56s)]
*  We're not even going there. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3661.52s)]
*  This is a fucked up thing. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3662.32s)]
*  But if you're. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3664.32s)]
*  Relax. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3665.6s)]
*  No, no, I mean this sincerely. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3666.4s)]
*  Okay. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3668.2400000000002s)]
*  If your dog was at the top of a tree, [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3669.68s)]
*  and you needed to get it down. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3673.2000000000003s)]
*  As a passion Pakistani, no problem. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3676.48s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3678.88s)]
*  Is that. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3679.52s)]
*  Climb up there is no problem. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3679.6800000000003s)]
*  And there's just a group of people looking. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3682.0s)]
*  Wow, this guy. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3684.4s)]
*  You just go. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3686.1600000000003s)]
*  Just go. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3687.84s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3689.12s)]
*  And you couldn't because you had a horrible injury. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3690.1600000000003s)]
*  You had a laceration or labrum or something like that. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3692.2400000000002s)]
*  You couldn't obviously go up the tree. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3694.7200000000003s)]
*  And everybody was like, I'd love to help. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3699.12s)]
*  I'd love to help. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3700.96s)]
*  I'd love to help. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3701.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3702.3199999999997s)]
*  That was really specific. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3702.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3712.08s)]
*  It's extremely specific. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3712.64s)]
*  That was really specific. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3713.7599999999998s)]
*  Why is that the first time he's been mentioned on this podcast? [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3715.44s)]
*  No, dude, we mentioned it before. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3718.0s)]
*  Oh, we did? [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3719.3599999999997s)]
*  I've shouted him out a couple of times. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3719.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3720.64s)]
*  For what? [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3721.04s)]
*  We talked about. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3722.96s)]
*  What did he say? [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3725.6s)]
*  What did he just say? [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3726.48s)]
*  What did he just say? [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3727.7599999999998s)]
*  He said something racist. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3728.3999999999996s)]
*  He said something racist. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3729.68s)]
*  What did he say? [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3731.04s)]
*  No, it just seems like if he's built like he could climb things well. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3731.6s)]
*  That's all I'm saying. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3736.56s)]
*  Yeah, he's got some Mowgli in him. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3737.52s)]
*  Just in terms of like the. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3742.08s)]
*  Dude, I'm not wrong. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3743.6s)]
*  Right? [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3744.4s)]
*  You see it. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3744.64s)]
*  Just in terms of the ability. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3745.12s)]
*  You see some Mowgli. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3746.48s)]
*  Yeah, he seems enthusiastic about helping. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3748.32s)]
*  Yeah, but also if there was like a vine that he had to get somewhere, [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3750.24s)]
*  he'd probably take that. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3754.32s)]
*  Take the Express. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3755.52s)]
*  Yes. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3756.4s)]
*  But that is. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3764.1600000000003s)]
*  I don't think we talk about that enough. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3766.7200000000003s)]
*  The fact that like you, we would all see vines and not use them to get where we needed to go. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3769.36s)]
*  But there are probably a lot of people that could do that effectively. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3773.84s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3780.48s)]
*  You're right about that. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3782.4s)]
*  I agree. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3783.12s)]
*  Especially like, let's say you were one of those American Ninja Warrior people. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3783.92s)]
*  Very specific. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3788.32s)]
*  They are really good at upper body strength. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3789.6800000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3791.28s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3791.78s)]
*  You're actually specifically correct. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3792.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3794.0s)]
*  But most of those guys are white. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3795.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3796.56s)]
*  So you really need a white. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3797.52s)]
*  Yeah, you need a fucking. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3798.88s)]
*  You are the most monkeyish in behavior. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3799.84s)]
*  Whites. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3802.08s)]
*  That is. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3802.58s)]
*  Tell me. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3805.52s)]
*  I mean, you walk around and bare feet all the time. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3807.28s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3809.52s)]
*  You like climbing things. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3810.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3811.84s)]
*  Love saving the environment the most. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3812.7400000000002s)]
*  Holy shit. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3814.34s)]
*  You guys play pranks with poop and shit. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3815.94s)]
*  Yeah, you are the most monkeyish. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3818.34s)]
*  There's a white lady that lives in a tree for four years to save her from getting cut down. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3820.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3823.78s)]
*  That's some monkey ass shit. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3825.3s)]
*  That's some monkey shit. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3826.26s)]
*  This monkey ass bitch is in there. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3827.46s)]
*  That's a monkey bitch. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3828.6600000000003s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3829.38s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3831.94s)]
*  So when white people call non-white people. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3832.82s)]
*  So he almost started talking back to you just now. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3835.22s)]
*  He had to hold it in. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3842.8199999999997s)]
*  I'm just saying when white people call non-white people monkeys. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3843.7s)]
*  It's a projection. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3846.8199999999997s)]
*  It's for a compliment. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3847.7799999999997s)]
*  It's the highest form of flattery. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3850.3399999999997s)]
*  If you are a white supremacist. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3852.66s)]
*  OK, that's true. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3854.58s)]
*  Right? You believe whites are the best and whites are the most monkey-esque. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3855.54s)]
*  By calling another minority a monkey, you're saying they are supreme as well. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3859.4599999999996s)]
*  Look at this fucking goofy bitch. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3864.98s)]
*  You got a goofy tree hugging Twilight bitch. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3868.98s)]
*  This was her house for like five years. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3875.22s)]
*  And she saved that tree. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3877.14s)]
*  I looked at this story. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3878.26s)]
*  She absolutely did. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3879.7s)]
*  And the second they came it down. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3880.9s)]
*  I wish they chopped that tree down. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3882.1s)]
*  The second she got on that tree. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3883.86s)]
*  I wish they chopped it down. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3885.46s)]
*  Oh God. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3887.22s)]
*  How do they get food up to her and shit? [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3888.82s)]
*  They don't need food. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3890.5s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3891.94s)]
*  She swung from vine to vine. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3892.5s)]
*  Take berries out of trees or whatever the fuck? [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3894.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3895.78s)]
*  No problem. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3897.06s)]
*  Birds, you can take their eggs. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3897.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3900.1s)]
*  I mean, look at this. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3900.5s)]
*  That's dope. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3901.3s)]
*  Yeah, really. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3903.86s)]
*  You got shit too good. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3904.42s)]
*  They show that no job. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3907.38s)]
*  You know what it is, Al? [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3910.1s)]
*  We've had shit good for too long. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3911.86s)]
*  That's what happens. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3915.46s)]
*  Because there are tons of minorities have shit good. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3916.74s)]
*  But they're so close to when it wasn't good. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3919.06s)]
*  Yeah, that's very true. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3922.74s)]
*  The whites that have had shit, it's not even good. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3924.18s)]
*  They don't even have to be rich. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3926.1s)]
*  They just have to be like middle class or upper middle class for generations. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3927.46s)]
*  Comfortable. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3932.66s)]
*  You're comfortable. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3933.3s)]
*  Once that comfort sets in, this goofy shit starts. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3934.1s)]
*  So you're just running it back. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3936.74s)]
*  So monkey and then you'll become Neanderthal and all that shit. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3938.1s)]
*  Whatever it is. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3941.46s)]
*  Because the super rich are always terrified they're going to run out of money. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3942.66s)]
*  Or they're going to lose all the money. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3945.86s)]
*  So they have that like motivation to keep on going. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3946.98s)]
*  But the generational upper middle class, the ones who are like, [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3950.1s)]
*  I'm never going to get beyond this, but we're not going to fall underneath. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3953.7s)]
*  They just get fucking bored and they start climbing trees and doing this shit. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3958.18s)]
*  Maybe she's trying to find a new place to gentrify. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3963.14s)]
*  Maybe that was it. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3965.62s)]
*  She's trying to get out of a neighborhood. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3966.2599999999998s)]
*  Wait, were you? [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3967.3799999999997s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3969.9399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, walk them into that. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3970.2599999999998s)]
*  Who would she gentrify in the tree, Mark? [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3971.06s)]
*  Walk them into that. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3974.8999999999996s)]
*  Mark, what people would she be kicking out of their community in a tree? [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3975.9399999999996s)]
*  This is a national park. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3980.74s)]
*  She was trying to colonize it from other white people. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3981.78s)]
*  Oh, is that how gentrification works? [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3983.6200000000003s)]
*  White people move out of their white people. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3986.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, they move out the poor whites. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3987.94s)]
*  Like in the polls. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3989.46s)]
*  Get it ready. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3990.5800000000004s)]
*  So Mark here, so your knee jerk reaction was she's trying to kick people out of their community. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=3995.46s)]
*  Who would live in a tree? [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4000.26s)]
*  What group of people in your mind would live in a tree? [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4001.7000000000003s)]
*  Elves live in trees? [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4004.34s)]
*  Oh, Nolan. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4005.3s)]
*  No, this is a national park. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4008.9s)]
*  She was trying to go in there and the people that go to national parks are white people. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4010.1s)]
*  So she was trying to fuck with them. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4012.9s)]
*  Hey, black guy. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4014.8199999999997s)]
*  Why is it? [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4019.06s)]
*  Yes, white guy. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4020.02s)]
*  Don't go to national parks. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4021.14s)]
*  Indian guy. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4022.3399999999997s)]
*  Why is it? [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4023.06s)]
*  And I will say, I went to some national thing. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4023.86s)]
*  A conference? [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4029.2999999999997s)]
*  A white nationalist conference? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4030.18s)]
*  It was in Washington, D.C. on January 6th. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4032.8199999999997s)]
*  And there was tons of Indians. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4036.58s)]
*  This was in like Utah. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4041.22s)]
*  In Utah? [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4043.62s)]
*  At a park? [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4045.14s)]
*  It was in like the Utah, was it Arizona border? [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4045.94s)]
*  Horseshoe Bend? [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4049.62s)]
*  You've seen that thing. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4050.98s)]
*  It's like a popular, whatever. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4051.62s)]
*  There was so many Indians. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4052.66s)]
*  It's not even funny. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4054.42s)]
*  And from India type shit. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4055.46s)]
*  So I think they make it part of their trip in America. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4057.7799999999997s)]
*  They're like, oh, I need to see this. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4060.02s)]
*  Majestic landscape. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4061.22s)]
*  They must be rich to make it past Empire State Building and all that shit. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4062.66s)]
*  They must be rich over there. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4065.46s)]
*  OK, so it's not a common thing. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4066.42s)]
*  I wouldn't think so. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4068.18s)]
*  I've never heard of it. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4068.82s)]
*  Alex, so why do you guys not go to the national parks? [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4069.78s)]
*  Why do you not frequent national parks? [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4072.5s)]
*  Because it's stupid. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4074.18s)]
*  OK. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4075.7s)]
*  OK, that's dismissive. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4077.2200000000003s)]
*  Why do you find it stupid? [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4079.3s)]
*  Because if I want to see a tree, I'll just walk anywhere outside. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4081.78s)]
*  And I don't have to get eaten up by bugs. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4085.3s)]
*  I don't have to worry about fucking animals. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4087.94s)]
*  That's just. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4089.94s)]
*  I think black people might have an aversion to too much outdoors [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4090.58s)]
*  because they were left out there for quite some time. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4093.3s)]
*  Wow. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4095.54s)]
*  Wow. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4097.86s)]
*  My white people. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4099.7s)]
*  So thank God. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4100.34s)]
*  My God. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4101.06s)]

*  Why are you mad at me for what I said? [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4102.82s)]
*  Oh, that was cruel. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4104.58s)]
*  Why are you mad at me for what I said? [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4105.62s)]
*  I don't think we left them out. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4106.74s)]
*  I think that there was places for them. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4109.86s)]
*  I think you made them work out there. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4113.22s)]
*  No, no, we would. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4114.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4115.62s)]
*  But then they could come inside. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4116.9800000000005s)]
*  No, only the ones. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4119.14s)]
*  Only certain ones. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4120.02s)]
*  Not inside our place, but there was a place for them. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4121.14s)]
*  There was a barracks or something like that. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4123.78s)]
*  It was a. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4125.46s)]
*  Barracks. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4127.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it was like a Ramada. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4127.94s)]
*  I think they had a Ramada in it. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4130.98s)]
*  It was three stars. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4132.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4134.179999999999s)]
*  It was a nice little three star Ramada. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4135.0599999999995s)]
*  Free continental breakfast. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4138.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4139.54s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4140.099999999999s)]

*  You all should go to national parks. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4147.139999999999s)]
*  This shit's fire. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4148.179999999999s)]
*  No. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4148.9s)]
*  Yeah, you just came back from a national park. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4149.4s)]
*  Grand Teton. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4151.62s)]
*  How was it? [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4152.9s)]
*  It was good. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4153.94s)]
*  A decent number of Indians, I will say. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4154.66s)]
*  What do you do? [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4156.58s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4157.219999999999s)]

*  One second. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4160.82s)]
*  I didn't understand one word of that sentence that you just said. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4162.099999999999s)]
*  What did you just say? [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4167.139999999999s)]
*  There's a decent number of Indians. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4168.34s)]
*  A decent number of Indians. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4169.46s)]
*  I thought you said you were teasing a number of Indians. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4170.82s)]
*  I didn't even hear it. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4173.62s)]
*  I was teasing them. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4174.42s)]
*  I would yell, bear, and then run away, and they would all freak out. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4175.94s)]
*  That was part of the thing that I would do. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4178.0199999999995s)]
*  But no, there was a good number of Indians. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4180.179999999999s)]
*  And what did you see them doing? [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4181.78s)]
*  Just walking around the national park. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4183.78s)]
*  Come on. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4185.3s)]
*  That's it. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4185.86s)]

*  No, there was... [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4187.0599999999995s)]
*  Was it raining? [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4187.62s)]
*  Come on. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4188.42s)]
*  It was not raining. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4189.0599999999995s)]
*  No. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4189.86s)]
*  Come on. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4190.0199999999995s)]
*  There was nothing. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4191.0599999999995s)]
*  It was a regular national park. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4191.94s)]
*  To be honest. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4193.139999999999s)]
*  The part that I saw them on mostly was the lake, [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4193.7s)]
*  Jenny Lake was a big lake out there. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4196.0199999999995s)]
*  Jenny Lake. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4197.7s)]
*  Jenny Lake. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4198.58s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4199.3s)]
*  I thought it was a white girl. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4199.78s)]
*  She's here somewhere! [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4202.0199999999995s)]
*  She must be here somewhere! [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4203.94s)]
*  Okay, what else? [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4207.78s)]
*  It was great. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4208.9s)]
*  And then we went on the trail and there was fewer Indians. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4209.38s)]
*  There's far fewer Indians. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4212.98s)]
*  And it was great. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4214.42s)]
*  A lot of white people? [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4215.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4216.099999999999s)]
*  Did you see any... [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4216.42s)]
*  Where the mud was? [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4217.54s)]
*  Where the mud was? [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4218.099999999999s)]

*  Where the mud was. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4219.62s)]
*  Mud was near the lake, I will say. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4221.139999999999s)]
*  Mud was mostly near the lake, but it was a good trail. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4222.42s)]
*  Did you see any animals? [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4224.98s)]
*  Besides the monkeys. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4227.38s)]
*  The white... [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4230.099999999999s)]
*  Besides the monkeys. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4230.58s)]
*  Besides the white... [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4231.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4231.94s)]
*  White ass monkeys. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4232.5s)]
*  White ass monkeys. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4232.98s)]
*  We saw chipmunks. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4233.7s)]
*  They told us there was a bear on the trail. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4234.58s)]
*  And? [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4236.5s)]
*  Started shaking in my sandals. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4237.139999999999s)]
*  I got a little scared. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4238.82s)]
*  You wore sandals to this hike? [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4239.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4241.38s)]
*  Where there was animals you might have to run from? [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4241.78s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4243.54s)]

*  You're thinking of Doc Martens, I think. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4263.3s)]
*  Merrill's is a hiking boot. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4264.58s)]

*  Yeah, it's the lightest shoe. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4270.26s)]
*  That way if I have to run, I can get away. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4271.78s)]
*  But you don't need lightness. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4273.3s)]
*  You need grip. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4274.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4275.3s)]

*  Yes, you can. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4277.7s)]
*  There's no way. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4278.18s)]
*  That's what we're born to do, bro. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4279.54s)]
*  I was trying to go the Native American way. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4281.14s)]
*  I wanted to be as close to barefoot as possible. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4283.38s)]
*  Yeah, but once they got shoes, they're like, this is awesome. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4285.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4288.5s)]
*  I mean, they felt, yeah. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4289.22s)]
*  Show me what you were wearing. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4292.5s)]
*  What is that? [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4293.3s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck you were wearing. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4293.7s)]
*  They have not rejected any of the cool shit that white people brought over. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4294.18s)]
*  Maybe they should have, is my point. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4297.700000000001s)]
*  I agree with you. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4299.46s)]
*  That's what the fuck you're wearing? [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4300.42s)]
*  Yeah, I was wearing my teevas. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4301.54s)]
*  Oh, you're trying to die, bro. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4302.5s)]
*  This is insane. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4303.9400000000005s)]
*  No, it's not a fire. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4304.34s)]
*  I'm telling you. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4305.860000000001s)]
*  Aren't you going up hills and shit like that? [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4306.5s)]
*  It was a mild trail. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4308.900000000001s)]
*  It was a mild, regular trail. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4310.42s)]
*  I hate this. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4312.34s)]
*  I do too. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4313.3s)]
*  I don't like it when girls wear these. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4314.1s)]
*  What color do you have? [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4316.1s)]
*  Oh, Miles. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4317.3s)]
*  Got the black ones. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4318.5s)]
*  Oh, Miles. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4319.46s)]
*  We got the black ones. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4320.26s)]
*  They have a nice little pattern on them. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4320.900000000001s)]
*  I don't know if you got the cool pattern on them. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4323.54s)]
*  This is the worst piece of, what would you even call it? [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4324.82s)]
*  It's not a shoe. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4328.58s)]
*  It's footwear. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4329.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4330.74s)]
*  It's terrible. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4330.9800000000005s)]
*  The worst? [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4331.7s)]
*  The teeva is the worst. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4332.26s)]
*  Stop there. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4333.54s)]
*  No, they're worse. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4334.34s)]
*  Show me worse. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4335.38s)]
*  Oriental Chinese shoes. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4336.18s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4337.7s)]
*  The ones that make their feet small and beautiful? [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4338.1s)]
*  Yeah, like the 1800s. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4339.9400000000005s)]
*  The ones that would bind their feet and make them adorably beautiful? [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4341.38s)]
*  That's a worst. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4343.62s)]
*  No, it isn't. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4345.06s)]
*  You think that's beautiful? [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4345.62s)]
*  Have you seen what their feet look like? [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4346.82s)]
*  It's like a ballet shoe. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4348.1s)]
*  They look like a croissant. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4348.82s)]
*  If you want to look at foot binding and what it does to the little Chinese women's feet, [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4349.86s)]
*  they make them adorable little croissants. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4355.78s)]
*  They roll them up into a beautiful little croissant. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4359.139999999999s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4361.62s)]
*  Come on. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4364.98s)]
*  You add some butter to that? [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4365.62s)]
*  That's a worse shoe. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4367.7s)]
*  That's by far worse than the teeva. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4368.66s)]
*  All right. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4371.139999999999s)]
*  Depends what you want out of it, but that is pretty fucking gnarly. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4371.46s)]
*  Mary Jane tabbies are ugly. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4374.099999999999s)]
*  Women are wearing them a lot now. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4376.58s)]
*  What are they? [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4378.5s)]
*  The ugliest sneaker for women to wear ever is the high heeled Nike dunk. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4379.38s)]
*  Oh yeah, that was a really stupid thing. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4383.9400000000005s)]
*  High heeled Nike dunk. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4386.42s)]
*  It's like a wedge Nike dunk. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4387.9400000000005s)]
*  That's ugly. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4393.780000000001s)]
*  That's not that bad. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4394.42s)]
*  I don't mind that that much. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4395.860000000001s)]
*  You don't see that there's a split in there and their toes split. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4398.1s)]
*  Yeah, that's far. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4400.900000000001s)]
*  Anytime I can think about toes. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4402.26s)]
*  I don't like this. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4403.700000000001s)]
*  Anytime I can just think more about feet. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4404.740000000001s)]
*  I love that. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4406.740000000001s)]
*  I also love that there's a separation. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4407.3s)]
*  That was a shoe. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4409.54s)]
*  No, no, that's not what like wedges. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4410.74s)]
*  There it is right there. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4413.14s)]
*  The green ones to the left. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4413.860000000001s)]
*  Up, up, up, up, left. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4415.06s)]
*  This? [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4417.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4417.860000000001s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4420.34s)]
*  Those were the worst. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4421.9400000000005s)]
*  It is impossible to look good wearing them. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4423.860000000001s)]
*  Like if you're a girl and you wear those, it is impossible to look attractive. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4426.18s)]
*  Anything above your ankles just melts when you wear those. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4429.78s)]
*  Like if I, oh my, oh my God, she's hot. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4433.38s)]
*  And I just can't even look at it. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4435.7s)]
*  That would be the only thing I'd ever let my daughter wear. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4437.379999999999s)]
*  She's like, can I wear a short skirt that I show my ass? [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4439.62s)]
*  As long as you're not wearing Nike wedges. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4442.339999999999s)]
*  That would be the only thing that I would say, no, no, you cannot do. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4444.66s)]
*  This feels racially motivated because I've only ever seen Puerto Rican women wearing this. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4447.219999999999s)]
*  I've only ever seen white girls. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4450.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4451.299999999999s)]
*  It's like their version of being cool. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4451.94s)]
*  They're like, oh, I'm hip. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4453.62s)]
*  I know about cool sneakers. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4454.74s)]
*  That's like Williamsburg and shit, right? [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4456.099999999999s)]
*  Really? [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4457.7s)]
*  No, not hipsters. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4458.099999999999s)]
*  Like just no style whites. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4459.94s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4463.459999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4465.62s)]
*  Just like middle America. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4465.94s)]
*  I'll tell you. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4466.98s)]
*  No, because they need to know about that. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4467.7s)]
*  I'll tell you name after the pod. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4468.9s)]
*  And you'll know exactly what we're talking about. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4470.18s)]

*  And the best way to do that is blue chew. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4552.9800000000005s)]
*  It's got the same active ingredients as all those other drugs, [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4554.900000000001s)]
*  but it's the blue chew. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4557.38s)]
*  So it's the one we trust. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4559.46s)]
*  He has a rock with us since the beginning. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4560.26s)]
*  Listen, there's no way you can't be better at sex. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4562.66s)]

*  You're a 1.0. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4567.38s)]
*  You probably are terrible. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4568.18s)]
*  Your dick is trash. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4569.3s)]
*  Nobody's ever told you. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4570.1s)]
*  Ladies, if you got a man who you love, but his dick is trash, [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4571.3s)]
*  I'm not going to name any names. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4573.780000000001s)]
*  My wife. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4574.900000000001s)]
*  This is probably a great thing to give them [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4575.860000000001s)]
*  so you can be a little bit more satisfied. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4577.38s)]

*  And let's get back to the show. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4604.66s)]
*  Wow. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4605.7s)]
*  That's fucking crazy. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4606.900000000001s)]
*  Devin Haney asked Dazon to remove the fight footage between him and Ryan Garcia. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4608.34s)]
*  No, granted, if Ryan cheated, which it looks like he did, I get that. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4613.7s)]
*  It's like he lost to somebody while that's cheating. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4618.18s)]
*  But Ryan has just controlled the narrative so well that [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4621.780000000001s)]
*  it makes Haney look like a bitch for complaining. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4625.06s)]
*  But he should complain. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4628.18s)]
*  The guy fought cheated. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4630.58s)]
*  Yeah, but also getting the fight footage off of Dazon is like, [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4632.02s)]
*  it's already on Twitter. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4634.820000000001s)]
*  That's where the clips are going to live. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4635.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it is a bitch ass move. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4637.3s)]
*  It's just bad. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4639.22s)]
*  You're going to look like a bitch. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4639.9400000000005s)]
*  You should just think it through and be like, well, it's going to be on Twitter forever. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4640.900000000001s)]
*  And me taking off Dazon is going to make people retweet it more. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4643.7s)]
*  Yeah, no, that's true. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4647.14s)]
*  But there should. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4650.02s)]
*  Yeah, it's so interesting. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4650.74s)]
*  Like this is the controlling a narrative. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4652.18s)]
*  This is the value of controlling a narrative because it's making Devin look petty when in [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4654.820000000001s)]
*  reality he was the one cheated. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4660.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4662.02s)]
*  And if you were cheated, you should feel justified in doing anything that you [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4662.42s)]
*  want to feel validated again. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4666.98s)]
*  Yeah, he has every right. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4669.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4671.0599999999995s)]
*  What is this? [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4672.58s)]
*  People keep saying it wasn't the steroids that made him lose. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4673.22s)]
*  Why people keep saying that? [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4675.22s)]
*  Is that a thing? [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4676.1s)]
*  It wasn't the steroids that made him lose. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4676.5s)]
*  Haney didn't lose because Garcia took steroids. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4678.34s)]
*  It was there like I keep seeing that tweet. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4680.42s)]
*  I don't understand how that's possible, but they'll just tweet that and leave it alone. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4682.74s)]
*  Like boxing fans as if it was something beyond just the strength, I guess. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4686.0199999999995s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4690.42s)]
*  He got knocked around. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4693.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4694.82s)]
*  Yes. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4696.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4696.44s)]
*  If he got punched hard by someone who's taking steroids, probably because of the steroids. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4697.5599999999995s)]
*  But he also got outboxed. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4702.5199999999995s)]
*  So I think that's what they're saying. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4704.679999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4705.799999999999s)]
*  It wasn't really that outboxed. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4706.759999999999s)]
*  Not that much, but you have to, that's part of it. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4708.12s)]
*  If there were no knockdowns and Garcia won every single round, I'd be like, okay. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4711.5599999999995s)]
*  But then you can make the argument like, yo, he's on the roids. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4717.88s)]
*  Maybe this helped him train longer, helped him have better cardio because your recovery time is [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4720.599999999999s)]
*  less. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4725.5599999999995s)]
*  So I don't know. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4727.08s)]
*  To me, it's just a perfect example of like controlling a narrative in the power of that [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4728.599999999999s)]
*  shit. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4732.5199999999995s)]
*  I'd be so pissed off if I was Haney though. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4733.5599999999995s)]
*  Right? [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4735.4s)]
*  So pissed off. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4735.9s)]
*  So what happened with the money? [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4737.4s)]
*  Like did he get the purses? [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4739.48s)]
*  So Ryan sacrifices like I think his $1.1 million guaranteed purse. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4741.4s)]
*  That goes back to I think Haney's promoter and then Haney might get some of that. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4745.4s)]
*  I imagine he will, but it doesn't matter because they both got pay-per-view money. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4750.599999999999s)]
*  So if they both made 25 or 50 million each, it's like you give them the one million. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4754.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4759.4800000000005s)]
*  Who cares? [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4760.120000000001s)]
*  You got to disincentivize cheating more than that. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4760.92s)]
*  It's got to be like you forfeit 60% of your pay-per-view or whatever. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4763.160000000001s)]
*  Ryan, whether he won the fight or lost, but he won. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4767.160000000001s)]
*  He won. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4771.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4771.72s)]
*  He just won. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4772.200000000001s)]
*  Like we want to all see his next fight. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4772.84s)]
*  He's taken a year off for the suspension. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4774.6s)]
*  He did something that was really clever. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4776.4400000000005s)]
*  He goes, before they gave him the suspension for a year, I'm sure they told his camp. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4777.72s)]
*  So it was like a day or two before he was like, you know what? [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4782.52s)]
*  I'm retiring. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4785.0s)]
*  And then it came out that he's suspended for a year. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4786.4400000000005s)]
*  He goes, you can't suspend me. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4788.52s)]
*  I'm already retired. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4789.4800000000005s)]
*  I think I'll come out of retirement about a year from now, by the way. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4792.120000000001s)]
*  That's funny. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4795.88s)]
*  He can just control the narrative. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4796.92s)]
*  So funny. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4798.76s)]
*  I think they needed to suspend him for more than a year though. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4799.64s)]
*  Talk to me. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4801.88s)]
*  Because it's like they usually take about a year off between fights. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4802.360000000001s)]
*  The bigger fighters. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4807.320000000001s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4808.280000000001s)]
*  Like this isn't a punishment. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4809.240000000001s)]
*  The UFC schedule for fighters is a lot different than the boxing schedule. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4811.0s)]
*  It's where you're saying like UFC guys will fight every fucking three months or something [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4815.32s)]
*  crazy like that. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4818.68s)]
*  But the boxing guys, they get to the highest level. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4819.400000000001s)]
*  They're fighting once a year, twice tops. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4822.04s)]
*  So you're really not even punishing them. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4825.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4827.88s)]
*  Is it illegal for him to schedule a fight the day after the suspension's over? [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4828.2s)]
*  Oh, that's a good question. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4831.96s)]
*  Like do you need to be a sanctioned fighter in order to schedule a fight? [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4832.92s)]
*  Because if I'm him, I would schedule it the day after [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4837.08s)]
*  and then just train a whole camp and be like, well, it's not illegal to train. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4839.56s)]
*  I'm not training for anything. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4842.52s)]
*  And because he's suspended, he won't get drug tested. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4843.8s)]
*  He could be on the wrong train. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4846.200000000001s)]
*  If I'm Ryan, no bullshit. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4850.360000000001s)]
*  I'm using steroids for the next fight again. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4852.68s)]
*  Just liver king shit. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4856.6s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4858.120000000001s)]
*  Go in, you knock them out again and then you pop for steroids again. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4858.92s)]
*  You're like, yo, we still talking about steroids? [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4861.8s)]
*  Are we really still talking about steroids? [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4864.280000000001s)]
*  You didn't think I was going to do it again. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4866.4400000000005s)]
*  It worked the first time. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4867.64s)]
*  I mean liver. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4869.64s)]
*  It's just liver. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4870.28s)]
*  That's all it is. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4870.92s)]
*  I set my one year suspension again. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4871.72s)]
*  I'll see y'all in three years. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4873.88s)]
*  50 million every other year. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4875.4s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4877.72s)]
*  Wow. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4878.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's kind of genius. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4878.84s)]
*  And then people will still watch. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4879.8s)]
*  He'll come back to fight someone else and be like, I promise I'm not going to use steroids. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4881.32s)]
*  Just have fun with it. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4886.28s)]
*  We don't care. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4887.16s)]
*  Is that why they're not being that heavy handed with the suspension? [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4887.72s)]
*  Because they're like, he's going to make us money. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4891.16s)]
*  He's going to get eyes like we need him. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4893.0s)]
*  Boxing's not. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4895.88s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4897.5599999999995s)]
*  People keep saying it's dying. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4898.2s)]
*  If he's the biggest name in boxing, you don't want to suspend the biggest name in boxing [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4899.4s)]
*  for too long. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4905.5599999999995s)]
*  And we would love to watch another fight with him and Tank, especially off of that Tank victory. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4907.88s)]
*  That's a bad motherfucker right there. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4915.16s)]
*  Oh God. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4916.44s)]
*  Tank is a bad motherfucker. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4917.32s)]
*  Just toyed with him. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4918.92s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4919.72s)]
*  I've never seen anything like that. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4920.76s)]
*  I know I'm a casual, but just seeing him in the corner just waiting. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4922.92s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4927.16s)]
*  Backflip after you knock a guy out. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4928.04s)]
*  I mean, I'm pissed off. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4929.56s)]
*  If you knock me out and you do a backflip, I'm like, what the fuck? [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4930.6s)]
*  There's means of this, but you're barely coming to and the first thing you see is a guy's [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4934.360000000001s)]
*  legs in the air jumping off the top rope. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4939.64s)]
*  What are you even thinking in that moment? [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4943.8s)]
*  You were in the air because he knocked you out. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4945.16s)]
*  He's in there on his own accord. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4947.24s)]
*  He just wanted to be his backflip. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4948.68s)]
*  The only more disrespectful is Tyson Fury knocking you out than singing a song. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4949.56s)]
*  That would infuriate me so much. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4953.320000000001s)]
*  A joke that Mike Tyson would kiss you after he knocked you out. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4956.68s)]
*  He's like, beat my ass and then come kiss me. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4958.68s)]
*  I'm not some bitch. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4960.52s)]
*  Yeah, apparently. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4962.28s)]
*  You said Michael beat your ass and then kiss you after the fight. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4963.32s)]
*  Like good fight. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4965.56s)]
*  But I think he did that once to this guy. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4966.44s)]
*  I think it was maybe Franz Botha or something like that. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4967.88s)]
*  And it sounds like it's like white Polish box. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4971.16s)]
*  My favorite white Polish box. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4976.76s)]
*  And it really sounds like I'm saying. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4978.04s)]
*  I love it. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4981.64s)]
*  No questions. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4982.28s)]
*  I got no questions. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4982.92s)]
*  Franz Botha. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4983.56s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4984.68s)]
*  No, I'm not doing anything. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4985.8s)]
*  Anyway, he helped him up and like kissed. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4986.92s)]
*  He knocked him out. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4988.92s)]
*  You don't remember that. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4989.64s)]
*  And then he tried to help him back up and like kissed him on the side of his face. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4990.200000000001s)]
*  Anyway, that shit is wild. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4994.120000000001s)]
*  This was powerful. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4995.160000000001s)]
*  So shout out Eddie. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4995.72s)]
*  All right, guys, back from a little bathroom break. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=4996.68s)]
*  Now, I want to know. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5000.52s)]
*  Mark did a little deep dive on Nvidia. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5002.360000000001s)]
*  Obviously, we've all heard about Nvidia, right? [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5007.320000000001s)]
*  Maybe some of you guys are invested in Nvidia. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5010.04s)]
*  God bless you if you are. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5011.96s)]
*  I have no fucking clue what this company is. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5014.04s)]
*  I don't know what they do. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5017.719999999999s)]
*  I don't know why they're good. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5019.08s)]
*  I don't know why they became the most valuable company in the world at one point. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5020.44s)]
*  They like topped Apple and Google and Microsoft and Microsoft. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5024.2s)]
*  Like what is going on? [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5027.4s)]
*  So my so so Mark is like, I'm going to do a little deep dive and break this whole thing down. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5029.8s)]
*  This might be redundant from some of you all sophisticated financial folks out there. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5034.04s)]
*  But for the rest of us that have no fucking clue and all these stocks are just a bunch [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5038.04s)]
*  of letters mashed together. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5041.48s)]
*  I like to know why this company is so fucking special. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5042.6s)]
*  Do you guys know? [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5045.320000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5046.280000000001s)]
*  OK, so Mark, take us to talk to us about Nvidia. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5047.08s)]
*  Take us to the beginning. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5050.92s)]
*  What is this Nvidia? [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5052.120000000001s)]
*  I'll tell you this. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5053.0s)]
*  If you if you put $10,000 into Nvidia in 2019, right now it would be worth $120,000. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5053.64s)]
*  If you put 10K into Nvidia in 2004, today it would be worth $5.3 million. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5061.56s)]
*  So it's just like exploding. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5067.96s)]
*  I had no idea what it was. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5069.0s)]
*  I'd seen it like on the ticker and I was like, what the fuck is this thing? [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5070.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5072.92s)]
*  So looked into it. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5073.4s)]
*  Basically, this guy created a company in like 1996 at a Denny's. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5074.84s)]
*  This guy is this guy Jensen Huang. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5080.12s)]
*  OK, he's a Taiwanese originally moved to Thailand and then went to Portland where he grew up. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5082.2s)]
*  OK, he went. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5087.88s)]
*  He got put into sick like private school. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5088.52s)]
*  So his parents sent him there. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5091.4800000000005s)]
*  He was like nine years old and the private school was super cheap. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5092.52s)]
*  His parents were in Thailand at the time, just sent him over. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5095.08s)]
*  It wasn't actually a private school. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5097.08s)]
*  It was a reform school. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5098.12s)]
*  Oh. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5099.08s)]
*  So he was in his roommate when he was like nine years old was like a 17 year old, like former criminal. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5099.48s)]
*  And they became like best buds and they like taught him how to like weight lift and shit. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5104.28s)]
*  Then he like helped the guy with his math. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5106.919999999999s)]
*  Like they became like best buddies when he was like nine years old. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5108.5199999999995s)]
*  I got this reform school. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5110.599999999999s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5111.5599999999995s)]
*  Crazy, right? [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5112.2s)]
*  Didn't you have a nickname? [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5112.759999999999s)]
*  I thought he had a funny nickname. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5115.4s)]
*  No, he did have a nickname. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5116.44s)]
*  Jensen is actually his nickname. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5118.36s)]
*  Oh, it is? [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5119.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5120.04s)]
*  And so literally he goes to school. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5122.44s)]
*  It's just a genius kid like graduates, skips a bunch of grades, graduates when he's 19 or 16 years old [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5124.04s)]
*  and then goes to Stanford and then just like destroys at Stanford and then goes into the computer [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5128.36s)]
*  science and becomes like an engineer designing chips and shit. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5132.599999999999s)]
*  And then in 1996, 97, these two guys come to him like VCE guys and they're like, [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5135.16s)]
*  hey, they're out of Denny's. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5139.4s)]
*  He loves Denny's, which is hilarious to me. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5140.5199999999995s)]
*  That's like his favorite restaurant. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5142.04s)]
*  And they all meet at Denny's and they're like, all right, let's start a company. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5143.639999999999s)]
*  GPUs aren't really a thing yet. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5147.16s)]
*  What's a GPU? [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5149.0s)]
*  A GPU is a graphic processing unit. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5149.799999999999s)]
*  All right. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5152.28s)]
*  I'll explain more of that in a second. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5152.679999999999s)]
*  But basically like computer graphics are just blown up. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5154.04s)]
*  Do you remember back in the day you play a video game and they were just starting to [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5156.44s)]
*  get computer graphics into it and it was like, oh, this is fire. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5159.8s)]
*  It's actually like 3D. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5162.5199999999995s)]
*  You can move around and shit. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5163.96s)]
*  It's not just like guys on a wall. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5164.84s)]
*  So he starts this company and the company immediately does pretty good. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5166.679999999999s)]
*  They get investment from Sequoia Capital, which is like the biggest VCE group ever, [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5170.679999999999s)]
*  gets a ton of money. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5174.84s)]
*  But then all these other companies come in. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5175.8s)]
*  Long story short, he beats at all the other companies because he bets the whole company one time. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5177.639999999999s)]
*  So they have basically nine months to make a computer chip, to make these graphics for [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5181.8s)]
*  these like movies and video games and shit, specifically video games. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5187.0s)]
*  And as he's doing it, they only have six to nine months to make it where it takes like [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5190.76s)]
*  two years normally to make the chips any other time. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5195.56s)]
*  So every other company is taking two years. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5197.88s)]
*  He figures out a way to be like, fuck it, we're going to do it in six months. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5199.400000000001s)]
*  So they start dropping these chips every six months. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5202.6s)]
*  And so they're iterating faster. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5204.52s)]
*  They're making the chips better than everyone. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5205.64s)]
*  And on top of that, they're making them faster than everyone. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5207.320000000001s)]
*  How does he make them faster and better? [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5209.72s)]
*  So basically, this is like kind of technical. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5211.96s)]
*  For all of the gaming things, they have basically 32 blend modes that these developers are using [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5214.12s)]
*  to make the video games. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5218.52s)]
*  And he basically goes, fuck the 24 of them. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5219.88s)]
*  We only need eight blend modes. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5222.12s)]
*  Ah, and so he's a blend mode. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5223.240000000001s)]
*  A blend mode is basically like a way that they can program the game. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5225.0s)]
*  That's the way I understand it. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5228.2s)]
*  Okay. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5229.16s)]
*  I'm a fucking computer science guy, but that's the way they're programming the game. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5229.4800000000005s)]
*  So he basically goes, all right, fuck the 24. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5232.6s)]
*  We're going to just streamline the fuck out of it. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5234.2s)]
*  We're going to do eight. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5235.56s)]
*  And he convinces all the developers like, you only really need these eight blend modes. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5236.280000000001s)]
*  And they're like, all right, we'll try it. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5239.08s)]
*  And then it works. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5240.12s)]
*  And then he's able to come up with the chips faster and faster and faster and iterate on [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5241.0s)]
*  them faster and faster and faster. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5243.64s)]
*  So he beats all these other companies that are in the space at the same time and all [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5245.0s)]
*  of a sudden edges them all out. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5248.36s)]
*  So now he's iterating super fast. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5249.48s)]
*  That's the whole company gambles, wins. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5250.84s)]
*  And this is like going to the 2000s. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5252.92s)]
*  He's focused specifically on like PC gaming. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5254.5199999999995s)]
*  So then they invent the GPU. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5257.08s)]
*  So the way that is explained to me, like a CPU is a computer processing, not computer. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5259.16s)]
*  It's computational processing unit. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5265.08s)]
*  Okay. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5266.84s)]
*  So basically what a GPU is, is basically just like turbo for your computer. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5267.24s)]
*  So like think like a graphics card. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5272.28s)]
*  So it makes all the video games you play on your computer way better. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5273.8s)]
*  Got it. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5276.28s)]
*  So he comes up with this GPU and basically like the way that you can think of a GPU is [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5276.92s)]
*  that like computers have cores and a core on a computer is like a PhD. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5281.5599999999995s)]
*  So like imagine you give a problem to like a PhD student. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5286.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5288.44s)]
*  And on a computer, they only have like two at the time. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5288.76s)]
*  There's only one now. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5291.5599999999995s)]
*  You might have like four or like eight if you have like an eight core processor. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5292.5199999999995s)]
*  It's like crazy. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5295.4s)]
*  But these are like super smart PhDs in your computer that can solve complex tasks. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5296.28s)]
*  A GPU has 10,000 cores. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5300.04s)]
*  But they're all dumber. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5303.16s)]
*  So it's like a bunch of like kindergartners. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5304.599999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5306.2s)]
*  So they can solve like plus and minus. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5306.599999999999s)]
*  But they can't do the sophisticated problems. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5308.679999999999s)]
*  They can't do a bunch of sophisticated shit, but they can do really small things and you [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5310.12s)]
*  can scale it out. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5313.08s)]
*  You can put 10,000, 20,000 of these cores into a GPU. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5313.88s)]
*  So it can do super specific things at scale really well. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5317.0s)]
*  So you're able to put in your computer and have a GPU. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5320.44s)]
*  All of a sudden you can have like these really sophisticated graphics. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5322.679999999999s)]
*  They develop a new way where the GPUs can have like 3D shading. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5325.16s)]
*  Remember like the early computer games? [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5327.88s)]
*  They would just have like the same lighting for everything. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5329.16s)]
*  Okay. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5331.0s)]
*  And then all of a sudden he comes up with a new way where all the lighting and shading [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5331.48s)]
*  is dynamic. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5334.12s)]
*  So as you move through the world, all this shit is brand new. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5334.599999999999s)]
*  But it's still a video game company. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5336.68s)]
*  So he's like making these video game things and the company starts going crazy. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5337.96s)]
*  They make like a billion dollars, the fastest like computer company to make a billion dollars [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5340.36s)]
*  ever. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5344.599999999999s)]
*  This is like into the 2000s. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5344.84s)]
*  So they're basically just like a computer company. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5346.5199999999995s)]
*  He's making a bunch of money. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5348.04s)]
*  Life is good. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5348.84s)]
*  And then in 2007, there's a Stanford computational science guy. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5349.72s)]
*  And he's trying to do these computations. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5354.12s)]
*  And basically what they're doing the computations for is like to do modeling. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5355.8s)]
*  So like you're Boeing and you have a plane. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5358.599999999999s)]
*  You don't want to just like make a thing like a wing or something and then have to test [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5361.64s)]
*  it over and over in a wind tunnel. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5365.48s)]
*  Da da da da da. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5366.76s)]
*  You can test it on the computer. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5367.64s)]
*  You can just do it through models on computers. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5368.599999999999s)]
*  So the Stanford guy is doing this like super sophisticated computational science on computers. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5370.68s)]
*  And Stanford has these huge supercomputers. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5374.36s)]
*  And you put it in a calculation. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5376.2s)]
*  You're like, all right, let's see what the calculation gives us. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5377.32s)]
*  And it might take like five days to get it in. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5379.24s)]
*  Modeling is just putting this part, this thing into a scenario and then seeing all the different [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5380.84s)]
*  outcomes. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5385.400000000001s)]
*  What happens? [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5385.72s)]
*  So instead of flying the plane with really bad wind and seeing if it lands or not, that's [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5386.280000000001s)]
*  too expensive because if it doesn't, it explodes. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5390.52s)]
*  You can run it through these models and you'll be like, oh, okay, these wings aren't sufficient. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5392.68s)]
*  It would have crashed. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5396.200000000001s)]
*  And these wings are good, but the fuselage is too bad. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5396.92s)]
*  Boom. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5399.72s)]
*  Okay. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5400.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5400.360000000001s)]
*  This is the model. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5400.6s)]
*  So they're a bunch of different companies doing different types of modeling and they're [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5401.240000000001s)]
*  kind of relying on these computer science guys to do the modeling. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5403.8s)]
*  But the supercomputers take so long. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5405.8s)]
*  This is like 2007. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5407.16s)]
*  So the guy that's a Stanford computational scientist, his kid is a video gamer and he's [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5408.92s)]
*  like, oh dad, you should get these processing chips from Nvidia. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5414.36s)]
*  I'm using them for my computer to play video games. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5417.24s)]
*  What if you use them to try to solve this equation? [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5419.64s)]
*  And so the dad goes out to a Best Buy or whatever, buys a bunch of chips, stacks them all together, [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5422.12s)]
*  puts it in, puts the computation through the chips and basically is able to solve in three [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5427.48s)]
*  hours. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5431.4s)]
*  And it usually takes? [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5432.04s)]
*  Five days. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5433.24s)]
*  So then he called Jensen. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5434.6s)]
*  He's like, dude, thank you so much. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5435.64s)]
*  You made my life so much better. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5436.5199999999995s)]
*  Hangs up the phone. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5437.88s)]
*  And Jensen is all of a sudden like, wait a second. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5438.76s)]
*  Are like computer chips for like video games is like helping solve like science problems? [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5440.68s)]
*  Like that's crazy. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5444.6s)]
*  And then it goes into this new thing, which is based like the birth of AI, which is like [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5445.8s)]
*  2012. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5449.88s)]
*  There's these guys at University of Toronto that basically they have this competition [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5450.4400000000005s)]
*  every year where they give them like 20,000 images and they have to create a computer [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5453.88s)]
*  program that can identify what the images are. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5457.72s)]
*  And at the time they would do it every single year and like it'd be like, oh, 50% accuracy [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5460.2s)]
*  in like 2006. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5464.4400000000005s)]
*  And then it was like 52% accurate two years later and then 55% accurate. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5465.48s)]
*  And so then these guys at the University of Toronto start using these Nvidia chips and [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5470.12s)]
*  they're able to get it with like 90% accuracy. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5473.639999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5476.12s)]
*  Which is like, sorry, it's just like a huge leap. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5476.599999999999s)]
*  That is like a categorical like jump. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5479.08s)]
*  This is the thing where, you know, you're signing into YouTube or whatever it is and [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5481.4s)]
*  it asks you to click all the images that have a side. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5485.48s)]
*  Ah, yeah. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5489.719999999999s)]
*  So what you're basically doing is notifying the, I guess it is the GPU, what a sidewalk [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5490.76s)]
*  looks like. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5496.52s)]
*  So if that GPU has something to get it right. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5497.56s)]
*  So you're throwing a hundred thousand little things at a task and the ones that get it [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5501.0s)]
*  right, they get rewarded, they stay and these ones die off and then you just run it again [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5505.0s)]
*  and run it again and run it again. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5508.68s)]
*  Ideally you get, I think that's how this predictive stuff works. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5509.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5513.4800000000005s)]
*  So it's able to like predict a bunch of stuff, but everyone's like, oh, is it able to like [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5514.04s)]
*  comprehend things? [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5517.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5518.12s)]
*  So like when it comes to like language models, like chat, GPT and shit, it's like, okay, [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5518.44s)]
*  you can predict what word comes next, but if you're translating to a different language, [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5521.96s)]
*  you can't really predict what comes next because different languages have different [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5526.04s)]
*  orders of words. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5528.5199999999995s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5529.5599999999995s)]
*  Like United States, French or Spanish is all flipped around. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5530.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5533.32s)]
*  So it doesn't help predict it. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5533.5599999999995s)]
*  So it's like, can it understand it? [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5534.839999999999s)]
*  And at the time everyone was like, no, we're too far off from understanding it. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5536.12s)]
*  Da da da da. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5538.679999999999s)]
*  So basically he sees all this happening with the Nvidia chips, like being able to like [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5539.5599999999995s)]
*  predict things through AI and the Nvidia chips again are so good because they have all of [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5542.919999999999s)]
*  these cores that can do things all in parallel. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5547.64s)]
*  So like in the way that the video game, like you would have different pixels that needed [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5549.88s)]
*  to populate stuff on a screen all individually without relying on the previous pixel. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5553.88s)]
*  All of a sudden with these GPU chips, they were able to put the pixels up on the screen [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5558.280000000001s)]
*  all independently and it was able to make the video game amazing. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5562.68s)]
*  And that's the same exact process that it takes to create like a large neural network [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5565.160000000001s)]
*  for AI. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5569.240000000001s)]
*  Oh, fuck me. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5569.72s)]
*  And so he's realizing this and he's like, oh shit, now they're pivoting their like video [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5570.6s)]
*  game company into an AI company. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5574.84s)]
*  And everyone is like, all right, Jensen, this seems like it's kind of crazy. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5577.5599999999995s)]
*  Like you've already bet the company twice in a row and like we've had these huge monumental [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5580.28s)]
*  gains in revenue. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5584.28s)]
*  Like we're making billions of dollars. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5585.08s)]
*  Why are you going to put the whole company? [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5586.28s)]
*  Fuck it up. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5587.5599999999995s)]
*  Like it's so risky. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5588.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5589.08s)]
*  And so he's like, nah, fuck it. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5589.719999999999s)]
*  And then he starts developing these products for AI. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5591.24s)]
*  And now basically like since 2012, it seems like all of like these neural networks and [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5594.28s)]
*  all the AI boom that's happened has come from this Nvidia hardware. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5599.0s)]
*  So in a time where everyone's like trying to catch up to be like, oh, how do we make [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5603.0s)]
*  chips for AI? [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5606.28s)]
*  How do we do it? [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5606.92s)]
*  They've already had 18 years of experience of like creating these processes that can [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5608.04s)]
*  run all of these equations in parallel. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5612.599999999999s)]
*  So they're not serial, which is just like they just had such a lucky like time. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5615.32s)]
*  There's basically this gold rush and Nvidia is selling like the pickaxes. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5619.639999999999s)]
*  And so they blow up. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5623.719999999999s)]
*  And then as AI obviously is like exploding, one of the guys from the Toronto school that [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5625.16s)]
*  did the very first like AI boom that predict all the images, one of those guys ended up [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5629.24s)]
*  co-founding open AI, I believe. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5632.759999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5635.719999999999s)]
*  So like he's already involved in AI. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5636.54s)]
*  He links up with Altman and Elon and they go into open AI together. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5637.9800000000005s)]
*  And so basically Nvidia is like the GPU processor that now is like lifting up the entire AI, [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5642.54s)]
*  which is like the invention of the day. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5649.740000000001s)]
*  It's like the Amazon Web Services. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5650.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5654.06s)]
*  Base of AI. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5654.3s)]
*  Did people tell you to invest in people told me to invest in 2020, a couple of people on [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5655.42s)]
*  IG and I was like, ah, I don't know. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5658.9400000000005s)]
*  I think that's when I got in. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5660.46s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5661.9800000000005s)]
*  Good for you. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5663.5s)]
*  Not a lot of money. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5664.06s)]
*  Did you really? [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5664.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5665.66s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5666.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5666.620000000001s)]
*  Really? [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5667.26s)]
*  I mean, I told you guys this, my stepfather in law, is that what it's called? [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5667.820000000001s)]
*  He was like silver. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5672.700000000001s)]
*  It was at the same time I did silver. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5674.620000000001s)]
*  Silver Nvidia. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5677.1s)]
*  And he was wrong about that. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5677.900000000001s)]
*  It was super wrong. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5680.54s)]
*  I was talking all that shit about silver. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5681.42s)]
*  I don't know what the fucking Nvidia was. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5682.9400000000005s)]
*  And then Bitcoin actually was a part of this also, because like for Bitcoin mining, [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5684.860000000001s)]
*  basically you just have to like put in a bunch of computations to solve some problems. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5687.820000000001s)]
*  So you can use that. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5691.26s)]
*  So it's just a bunch of math. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5692.3s)]
*  And so it's simple arithmetic. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5693.34s)]
*  It's just like plus this, minus this, multiply this. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5694.62s)]
*  But because the GPU is all parallel and is able to do all of these really simple things, [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5697.74s)]
*  but at scale, they're able to run all the Bitcoin mining on it. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5701.18s)]
*  So that was like one of their big booms in like 2017, 2018. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5704.46s)]
*  The gamers were really pissed. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5708.22s)]
*  They couldn't buy processors. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5709.26s)]
*  Because they're all being gobbled up by the crypto. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5710.78s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5712.86s)]
*  So then they see this and they're like, all right, let's pivot. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5714.06s)]
*  Let's make a crypto mining GPU. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5715.82s)]
*  And then they come out with that. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5719.0199999999995s)]
*  And then they're like, oh, AI is popping. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5720.06s)]
*  Let's make an AI GPU. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5721.42s)]
*  And now they're selling all these GPUs. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5723.02s)]
*  But now all these companies are like, oh, man, the GPUs are like kind of difficult to use [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5724.38s)]
*  because we need like a computer science engineer to come in and actually set it up. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5727.42s)]
*  So then he starts selling bundles and then creates a CPU to deal with all the GPUs. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5730.540000000001s)]
*  And he's selling them for like hundreds of millions of dollars. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5735.18s)]
*  So like he's going to McDonald's. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5737.660000000001s)]
*  He's going to Walmart, going to all these companies being like, [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5738.9400000000005s)]
*  yeah, here's a $200 million contract to get our bundle that's going to do everything for you. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5741.1s)]
*  And like basically be your own AI. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5746.22s)]
*  And now they have like a cloud computing thing. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5748.46s)]
*  They've written their own code for it, CUDA, [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5750.780000000001s)]
*  which is basically like a software language and a platform that like exists for all the Nvidia [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5752.7s)]
*  hardware. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5757.66s)]
*  So they've become like a hardware company and a software company that started as a video game [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5758.46s)]
*  company that now is like leading the AI boom. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5762.22s)]
*  So it makes a ton of sense why it's the biggest company in market cap. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5764.78s)]
*  But the whole shit. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5767.58s)]
*  Because AI is the future. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5768.22s)]
*  And they are the tip of the spear. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5770.3s)]
*  They are the whole spear. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5771.66s)]
*  The spear. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5772.62s)]
*  They are the entire spear. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5773.58s)]
*  Yeah, basically. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5774.78s)]
*  And there's other companies that are trying to catch up. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5775.26s)]
*  And like they're so far behind. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5776.94s)]
*  And whether or not they can hold is like a question of, you know, [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5778.54s)]
*  how good their leadership is and like how well they can like dominate the market. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5781.42s)]
*  But it seems like they're holding out. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5784.38s)]
*  And then the name is actually kind of funny. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5786.78s)]
*  It's like I didn't know what Nvidia was. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5788.14s)]
*  But like so they were saving all their files in the early days as NV. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5789.66s)]
*  So like they were doing NV files. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5793.02s)]
*  There's like a new version. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5794.3s)]
*  And so they're like, all right, what's like a word that has like NV in it? [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5795.58s)]
*  And so they find this Latin word for envy, literally like being jealous. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5798.38s)]
*  And they're like, oh, the Latin word for envy is Nvidia. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5802.62s)]
*  So they're like, let's just do Nvidia. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5805.74s)]
*  And because we'll be like the envy of the industry. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5807.34s)]
*  So they made their color green for like to make everyone jealous and shit. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5808.86s)]
*  Kind of fire. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5812.7s)]
*  Yes. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5813.42s)]
*  But I had no idea. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5813.74s)]
*  And so now there's like all these sanctions where like the government stepped in. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5814.54s)]
*  They're like, all right, you can sell these bundles and shit. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5817.42s)]
*  You can't sell them to China. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5819.179999999999s)]
*  And so now they are able to like parse the bundle. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5821.0199999999995s)]
*  And it's like a bunch of different like cores and GPUs and stuff. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5823.74s)]
*  And they're able to sell that to China, but they can't do certain things. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5826.46s)]
*  All the work together. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5828.94s)]
*  So now there's like all these like legal loopholes they're jumping through. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5829.74s)]
*  But then the question is, if we block China off, [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5833.179999999999s)]
*  are they going to develop their own AI and their own thing separately? [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5835.099999999999s)]
*  And then who knows what that can do? [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5838.22s)]
*  Can it be better? [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5839.42s)]
*  Like if we just injected the Nvidia stuff into China, [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5840.46s)]
*  we would have some control over it. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5843.1s)]
*  But now we don't have as much. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5844.38s)]
*  Or they would just deconstruct it and then create their own anyway, [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5845.42s)]
*  which is what they do with everything. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5847.58s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5848.860000000001s)]
*  Because yeah, they don't adhere to any of the copyright laws. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5849.42s)]
*  They'll just take whatever we do and they'll just make their own. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5851.66s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5854.14s)]
*  So then the stock is like super valuable. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5854.7s)]
*  Everyone's buying in and it goes crazy. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5856.7s)]
*  And then like apparently some of the internal people like sell off [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5858.46s)]
*  because they're like, dude, we just hit the jackpot. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5861.18s)]
*  Like I had, you know, like a 0.01% of a share in 1996 and now it's worth a million dollars. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5862.7s)]
*  Let me sell. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5868.54s)]
*  And so now like the stock is dropping. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5869.58s)]
*  So like there's some volatility with it, but it seems like it's [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5871.099999999999s)]
*  arguably going to be the biggest company ever. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5874.54s)]
*  When was COVID? [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5876.46s)]
*  2020. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5878.0599999999995s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5880.139999999999s)]
*  So maybe it was during COVID that I put some money in there. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5880.54s)]
*  Remember I went to Colorado? [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5884.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5886.139999999999s)]
*  Did that hot air balloon shit? [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5886.38s)]
*  I don't remember that, but I remember you telling us you got into silver. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5887.74s)]
*  Well, that was it. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5890.54s)]
*  That was around that time, right? [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5891.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5892.38s)]
*  We're just crazy. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5893.42s)]
*  So I'm like, not legal, not financial advice, [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5894.46s)]
*  but I'm like, should I invest money in a video? [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5897.02s)]
*  It seems like a good idea. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5899.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5900.46s)]
*  Is it too late now? [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5900.620000000001s)]
*  It's never ready. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5902.38s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5903.1s)]
*  I mean, it's on a dip right now. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5903.34s)]
*  So if you buy now, it's. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5904.46s)]
*  Yeah, buy the dip. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5905.5s)]
*  Because if this is the, if AI is the future, which once you start to dabble in that AI shit, [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5906.14s)]
*  bro, like, I don't know if you're using it for your life at all. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5912.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5914.22s)]
*  Are you? [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5914.46s)]
*  I use it every day. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5914.9400000000005s)]
*  I haven't been able to use it functionally in terms of like [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5915.740000000001s)]
*  it making my day to day more efficient, but I've been able to use it for like moments. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5920.06s)]
*  Like I just ask it. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5926.22s)]
*  I'll just ask it random questions that I don't know how to Google. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5927.34s)]
*  Like everyone asks Google a question like it's a person. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5930.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5933.02s)]
*  You know, like, and then that just doesn't exactly work. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5933.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5935.66s)]
*  Like, am I tall enough for a Suzuki? [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5935.9s)]
*  You know, am I too tall for a Suzuki Samurai? [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5937.58s)]
*  Like if you type that in Google, like Suzuki Samurai videos, [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5940.94s)]
*  where to buy a Suzuki Samurai. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5944.14s)]
*  Here's a YouTube video, like maybe the person's whatever. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5946.7s)]
*  But I typed that shit into chat, GBT and chat to GBT. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5949.42s)]
*  And I said, I'm six, two. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5952.14s)]
*  And it was like, it is a smaller car. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5953.5s)]
*  It might be an issue for you height wise. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5955.74s)]
*  That being said, there's a roof that you can take off. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5958.3s)]
*  So you have more room that like, it just started giving me the information [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5961.34s)]
*  that was more exact that I wanted. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5965.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5967.82s)]
*  So I've been trying to do that for any question. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5968.38s)]
*  I'm trying to use chat, GBT first. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5973.34s)]
*  And this one might be an answer to your question. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5975.58s)]
*  If somebody told you in 2011 to buy Apple, you'd be like, [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5977.26s)]
*  they got the iPhone. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5982.3s)]
*  How much higher can it go? [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5983.42s)]
*  It can keep going higher. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5985.1s)]
*  That might be the people are barely using AI. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5986.62s)]
*  If they're an AI company, and we assume that is the future, [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5990.06s)]
*  and people are barely using it, like this isn't even close. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5992.46s)]
*  What I would look at is if there's another company, [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5995.5s)]
*  because there's going to be competitors, right? [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=5998.22s)]
*  I would also look at if there's another company that's like on the rise, [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6000.22s)]
*  and you get in early there, there might be more opportunity for like extreme growth. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6003.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6007.02s)]
*  But it's not a bad idea to have this mixed in. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6007.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6009.42s)]
*  And so right now their market cap is like three trillion. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6010.14s)]
*  That's nice. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6012.780000000001s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6013.18s)]
*  So basically all of the shares that are out owned by the public, [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6014.14s)]
*  as well as private employees. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6017.58s)]
*  Based on its current rate is three trillion dollars. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6019.5s)]
*  Yeah. So the news was like, they lost 500 billion or something over the weekend. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6023.34s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, that's a lot of money. It's not good. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6027.1s)]
*  But you look at against a three trillion dollar value. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6029.5s)]
*  3.5 trillion to three trillion. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6031.5s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6033.9800000000005s)]
*  Like they're still, it's unbelievable. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6034.54s)]
*  And so this dude is betting the company over and over and over. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6036.700000000001s)]
*  He's like, all right, we're going to make faster chips. We have to. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6038.94s)]
*  And they were like, how do you know the chips are going to work? [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6040.86s)]
*  This is back in the 90s. How do you know the chips are going to work? [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6042.299999999999s)]
*  And he was like, well, if they don't work, we'll be out of business. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6043.98s)]
*  So we'll make them work. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6046.38s)]
*  And so to do it like to do the chips back in the day, literally like they would get the chips, [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6047.179999999999s)]
*  they would test them, find all the bugs, send it back to the fabricator in Taiwan. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6050.86s)]
*  They would fix it, send it back. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6054.54s)]
*  And that's why it took two years. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6055.9s)]
*  But they just did all the all the like testing of it, like digitally. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6057.099999999999s)]
*  And they're like, we just have to test it and all do it all in the computer to see if it works. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6060.299999999999s)]
*  And if it works, then. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6064.46s)]
*  And this is an American company. It's all being done here. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6065.82s)]
*  So why would someone stock in Taiwan? [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6068.38s)]
*  It's getting the actual chips are fabricated in Taiwan. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6070.38s)]
*  And I understand why we can't just create factories just to fabricate them here. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6073.5s)]
*  I mean, they are small. These chips are very small. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6079.34s)]
*  No, he's saying our hands are. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6081.82s)]
*  The chips are too small. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6083.74s)]
*  Yeah, this is so tiny. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6084.7s)]
*  But why is that? It seems like you could create it like a factory is easiest thing to create. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6085.82s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know why. I don't know what the reason is. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6090.46s)]
*  Right. Like if you have the technology and you have the know how, [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6093.18s)]
*  I feel like scaling a factory is easy. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6097.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, maybe they haven't paid really low. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6099.9800000000005s)]
*  Let me ask Chad. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6104.38s)]
*  Cost analysis won't be wouldn't be beneficial to do it here because we'll have to pay them more. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6106.3s)]
*  Maybe. But I thought that Taiwan was, I think, what they call like a newly industrialized nation. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6111.900000000001s)]
*  So it's it's like a booming economy, like a and a second world country that's like [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6116.860000000001s)]
*  now first world. And because of that, you're going to have like higher minimum wages. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6122.46s)]
*  I've heard I've heard it takes a lot of effort to create the infrastructure to build them. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6127.1s)]
*  And because it's already in one place, you just sort of go. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6131.82s)]
*  So it's very hard to build them. So it's not as simple as like an assembly line for. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6135.26s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's super technical. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6139.66s)]
*  So it's like watchmaking and why it's still sort of like in Switzerland. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6140.86s)]
*  And yeah, there is a lot of knowledge like concentrated in that one area on the process. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6144.3s)]
*  Yeah, that's what it seems. I mean, Chad, [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6150.38s)]
*  JPT is like high cost to like build it like effectively workforce shortage [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6152.14s)]
*  government incentives. So apparently there's like high government incentives to like do it in Taiwan. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6156.86s)]
*  I mean, they better keep making them shits. That's the only reason they Taiwan. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6161.18s)]
*  Right. Like the second they stop making them. It's China. It's China. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6165.26s)]
*  Yeah. So it's just wild. Like the amount of times this guy went in and like bet the whole [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6169.1s)]
*  company. That's awesome. And just like pivoted a bunch of different times and just saw things [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6173.9s)]
*  that other people didn't see. Has he done a bunch of pods? [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6177.18s)]
*  He's done a handful. And how's his English? [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6179.5s)]
*  Great. I mean, he like grew up in Portland since he was like nine years old. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6181.58s)]
*  Oh, wow. How much is he worth? I would think he's. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6185.1s)]
*  He's the future richest man in the world. I'd imagine. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6188.14s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, right now, I think his net worth, I think is like 25 billion or something like that. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6190.46s)]
*  But I don't know. I don't know if that's like public, like with his shares and everything. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6194.54s)]
*  Yeah, that's what the shares I would imagine. 110 billion. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6200.22s)]
*  Now that's. Sorry. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6204.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's more like. So yeah, he's making his way. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6205.0199999999995s)]
*  He's going to be the first billionaire, I think. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6207.98s)]
*  I mean, at this point, and he's kind of sick to be like works out. He wears leather jackets [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6210.86s)]
*  and all those things. There's a picture of him signing boobs somewhere. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6213.82s)]
*  Really? Yeah. Yeah. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6216.7s)]
*  He's just like, he's kind of a G. He's just like, I don't know. He's a sick dude. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6217.9s)]
*  But it just blew my mind. I had like seen this company blowing up all over the place [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6221.18s)]
*  and I didn't know anything about it. It might be the most successful company [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6224.38s)]
*  that people really don't know what they do. Yeah. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6229.82s)]
*  I think people are aware that it's like chips, but I don't think they realize they're investing [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6233.34s)]
*  in it. Well, the investors, yes, but like the average person, I don't know if they know that [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6237.58s)]
*  they're it's an AI company, essentially. There was a video game chip processing company. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6240.94s)]
*  Yeah. And like that was the thing. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6245.179999999999s)]
*  What world do we live in where knowledge is so separated? [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6247.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6250.46s)]
*  And wow, how the biggest company in the world. People don't even know what it does. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6251.099999999999s)]
*  What the fuck is happening? How isolated are in our own little bubbles are we? [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6256.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, quite. Yeah. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6261.900000000001s)]
*  But could could that happen when we were children? Yeah. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6263.18s)]
*  I don't know if there's maybe with microchips, but when we were kids, [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6266.62s)]
*  think about the biggest companies in the world. We knew more or less what they did. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6270.14s)]
*  How do you Ramco? I'm trying to think like, yeah, I mean, [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6274.54s)]
*  alphabet like Google. That's Google. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6277.820000000001s)]
*  Microsoft, Apple, obviously, Eli, Amazon, Amazon, done. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6279.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Berkshire Hathaway. I wouldn't know Berkshire Hathaway. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6284.86s)]
*  I knew that it was a company that owns a bunch of companies like that's Berkshire Hathaway [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6288.46s)]
*  isn't a business like it's the you're investing in his portfolio. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6295.339999999999s)]
*  That was Romney, right? Say again. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6299.82s)]
*  Romney. No, no, no. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6301.66s)]
*  Buffett. Yeah. Romney's Bain. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6302.62s)]
*  Bain Capital. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6304.7s)]
*  That's crazy. That is a that is a peculiar thing. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6307.82s)]
*  Yeah. Is that in my mind is the equivalent and I'm just drawing this connection [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6310.94s)]
*  just personally, but like John D. Rockefeller, like when he first started like oil refining, [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6314.54s)]
*  there was just kind of used for like gas lamps and stuff. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6319.58s)]
*  Like he starts oil refining before the industrial revolution. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6322.78s)]
*  Like really takes. So he's like selling like oil for your lamps and like light your house up and [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6325.58s)]
*  shit. And then all of a sudden the industrial revolution happens and everyone needs oil. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6330.78s)]
*  And he's like, oh, well, I own all these refineries and then tease it up and then just takes over [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6333.5s)]
*  everyone. So like Nvidia, there's another AI company that's like, or like hardware [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6337.9s)]
*  company that's building the GPUs and video just be like, you know, here's 20 bill. We'll acquire [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6342.06s)]
*  you. You know what I mean? Like if I'm like a software engineer right now, I'm going to [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6345.900000000001s)]
*  develop a small nascent competitor to Nvidia to try to get acquired. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6349.900000000001s)]
*  And then they'll just give you a billion dollars to go away. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6354.620000000001s)]
*  Why aren't we doing that right now? Right. We can. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6357.42s)]
*  We're not smart enough guys. I don't want to admit that. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6359.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I think we can do it. Honestly. Yeah. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6363.660000000001s)]
*  I mean, Mark just learned that in a night. That's what I'm saying. So let's just say [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6365.820000000001s)]
*  we're doing it and then maybe we'll give us a mill. Yeah, we could say we're doing it. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6369.02s)]
*  Exactly. Come on. Dude, this is five years communication. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6372.14s)]
*  Yeah, I think I can do this. We're all college grads. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6375.42s)]
*  Okay. So is this a, is this a function of like the internet completely compartmentalizing our [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6378.700000000001s)]
*  knowledge base? I partly. Yeah. I also think it's just out of the realm of comprehension of most [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6383.580000000001s)]
*  people. It's AI. It's such a new technology. Even Bitcoin. We weren't that siloed, but none of us [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6389.34s)]
*  really knew what the fuck the blockchain was in 2011. That's fair. Yeah. That's a good point. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6394.620000000001s)]
*  I'm just saying like the biggest company in the world, usually people would know what they do. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6398.46s)]
*  And I'm sure there are a lot of people like, yeah, idiot. We know what they do. We invested in them. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6402.7s)]
*  You guys are the idiots that haven't invested. Sure. But we represent the common person. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6406.38s)]
*  I think we represent, yeah, the normals. Like, yeah, I think most people hear about it. They see [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6409.66s)]
*  the guy, but they don't really know what's going on. But yeah, I wonder if that's what happens. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6414.7s)]
*  Like there used to be like back in the day, the way that information was disseminated is, [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6420.14s)]
*  these channels had to go, what will most people like? Right? I'm not going to just create content [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6426.7s)]
*  for Asians and Indians and conservatives. They're like, what do most people want to learn about [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6433.82s)]
*  today? And this would probably fit into that. Yeah. Back in the day, it was like the most [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6440.06s)]
*  successful company I'm going to explain it to you. But now if it doesn't in some way satisfy your [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6444.78s)]
*  base's thirst for validation, you don't have to teach them about it. And if people aren't [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6451.18s)]
*  invested in it, they're like, I don't want to know about it. I don't know why it's good. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6456.38s)]
*  Yeah. It's also because most people aren't touching it. You know what I mean? Like when [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6461.18s)]
*  windows dropped, like windows, what was the one that like everyone crazy? 95. Yeah. Like [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6463.740000000001s)]
*  Microsoft dropped this thing that I went out and bought. Like Apple dropped an iPhone that I went [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6469.1s)]
*  out and bought. Like Amazon is a company that I use every day. Whereas like Nvidia, people are [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6473.740000000001s)]
*  using it. I don't even know if they know they're using it. They don't. Yeah. Yeah. It feels a [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6478.62s)]
*  little bit similar to, and maybe you were early adopter, but like, remember when crypto got to [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6483.58s)]
*  the point where you just had to buy something because you had so much FOMO. Do you remember [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6489.099999999999s)]
*  all of us? I think it was like around Miami time. It was just like, even if you got $50 and you're [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6495.099999999999s)]
*  like, what the fuck is happening? Everybody's a billionaire now. What's going on? I wasn't that [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6499.74s)]
*  much earlier than that. But it was, it was around that time. You started to feel it. You're like, [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6504.54s)]
*  there's something happening here. It's exciting. Only this is based on reality. Like this it's, [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6508.54s)]
*  it's like, imagine Bitcoin could actually do something. That's this. This is the only [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6514.06s)]
*  company that has returns close to what Bitcoin gave people. Whoa. That's crazy. The only difference [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6517.9s)]
*  is that now this is in like people's retirement portfolios. So like, I think like the average [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6522.78s)]
*  retirement portfolio has like 5% exposure to Nvidia. Whereas like Bitcoin, most like retirement [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6527.98s)]
*  portfolio is done at Bitcoin. So like now like the American economy is almost like floated a [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6533.74s)]
*  little bit by this company. That's crazy. Like it's like, it's kind of like consolidated in terms of [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6537.9s)]
*  like what the NASDAQ or what the S&P is like holding onto. You know, what's interesting is [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6542.46s)]
*  it's almost like beneficial to Nvidia that people don't learn about his pension to bet the whole [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6548.78s)]
*  company. Yeah. Cause like, if your retirement money is in this company and this guy every once [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6556.94s)]
*  in a while on a whim goes, yeah, I'm going to pivot and bet the whole company. That's kind of [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6562.7s)]
*  scary. So let me say, he would actually say, I didn't bet the company. Like from the outside, [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6566.62s)]
*  from speculators, it's like, oh, what is he doing? But for him, whenever he talks about it, he's like, [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6570.86s)]
*  no, I was a hundred percent sure. This is what the thing was. And when we pivoted to that and we kind [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6575.099999999999s)]
*  of focused our energy on that, I was like 1 million percent certain that it would work. And so he's [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6580.0599999999995s)]
*  like, they're not bets. They're guarantees that they're going to happen. So he's very confident [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6584.86s)]
*  the way he talks about it. They're like, nah, when we go in on something, it's the future. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6589.34s)]
*  He just sees shit that other people don't see. And which is crazy because I'm over here being like, [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6593.34s)]

*  You know what gives me a little bit of a solace is somebody said this is like, if you invented, [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6618.54s)]
*  if you invested $5 in Bitcoin back in whatever 2000, whenever it started, you'd be a billionaire [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6627.34s)]
*  by now. I would have yanked that shit out of $50. The same 10 X, 10 X. I'm rich, bro. 10 X. So [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6632.3s)]
*  that's, that's what makes me feel comfortable. Like the person that just put the money in early [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6644.780000000001s)]
*  and just stayed those people, one, they're not even looking at the investment. They're like [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6649.900000000001s)]
*  throwing money at random shit. They forget about it. All of a sudden it blows. And then to not take [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6653.900000000001s)]

*  FOMO about missing out on the opportunity. Cause you know what you would have done. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6664.9400000000005s)]
*  I know what I would have done. Like I'm so happy. I forgot. I even invested in it. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6668.38s)]
*  I had a business manager tell me like, you're really up on Nvidia. And I go, what? I thought [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6675.02s)]
*  it was a crypto. I thought it was a crypto. And they go, no, no, this company, whatever. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6678.9400000000005s)]
*  And then I thought that it was a stem cell company because somebody's, what's the name of the fuck? [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6684.54s)]
*  Chris? Yeah. Fuck. Yeah. Are you in on that one? No, I want to be in, but I'm going to get in soon. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6693.9800000000005s)]
*  But yeah, it's a gene therapy thing. Yeah. Yeah. Oh shit. It's a really know about that. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6698.54s)]
*  The book that you shit on called the future is faster than you think. Well, fuck that was right. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6703.34s)]
*  Well, anyway, I got into that one. But again, this is none of my own volition, but yeah, [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6707.42s)]
*  like that same one, it was the same type of thing. It's like, if you can start to manipulate these [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6715.1s)]
*  genes, you can really one fix certain things. I mean, it's crazy where humanity goes. You're [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6719.9800000000005s)]
*  building super. I could have a child that's five, nine. Oh, but also to me it was just like, [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6725.18s)]
*  Oh, can we reverse, you know, my dad's dementia, but then it's going to, where's it going to go [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6732.700000000001s)]
*  from there? We're not going to stop at curing dementia. And most people use it for what you're [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6736.54s)]
*  talking about, which is like, how do we make sure our kids have the most effective genes [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6740.54s)]
*  or eliminate diseases that they might have. But you look at that, you're like, Oh, we're kind of [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6744.9400000000005s)]
*  close to this. It's frightening, but pretty awesome. Yeah. Yeah. Even little things like, [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6748.9400000000005s)]
*  short-sightedness or near-sightedness, whatever. Like, yeah, let's just fix that. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6753.179999999999s)]
*  That's where it's going to start, right? It's like, it's same thing with like teeth. Like we [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6756.78s)]
*  don't even see what is a dentistry as plastic surgery. We're like, Oh, you're just fixing your [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6760.0599999999995s)]
*  teeth. Right. And it will start with the gene therapy. Like, Oh yeah. Well, you shouldn't have [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6764.3s)]
*  to wear glasses. Let's just knock that out. And then after that, it's going to be, [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6768.46s)]
*  Yeah, that might be the first glasses. Something like that. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6772.38s)]
*  You shouldn't have to be too dumb. What if they can bring your IQ up to like a certain level? [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6775.42s)]
*  If they predicted it would be like, what is it? The 80, they could bring it up to what's a fair IQ? [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6782.46s)]
*  110. 110. Okay. They bring it up to 110. Then everybody with a 110 was supposed to be an idiot. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6788.0599999999995s)]
*  That's another thing. You've got to start lying about your 110. Yeah. Do you tell your kid they're [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6795.66s)]
*  a crisper kid though? Cause like that's so much pressure being like, yo, we made you smart. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6799.58s)]
*  We put smartness into you. And then if they're not smart, be like, bro, we spent money. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6803.98s)]
*  Yo, we wasted our friends. Yeah. So that's one good thing about not being able to have a baby [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6807.34s)]
*  right now is maybe if we wait a couple of years, I could crisp the fuck out of this kid. Yeah. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6812.7s)]
*  Crisp them up. That's funny. Yo, I was going to get stem cells because I have like tennis elbow [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6815.9800000000005s)]
*  right now. And so I went to this guy and I don't know how. You have tennis elbow already. I've [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6822.14s)]
*  been playing. I'm playing. I'm nice. And your left elbow. No, you're not nice if you got tennis elbow [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6826.22s)]
*  already. That's what I'm saying. What are you doing? I play bro. I do this. I do this. I do this. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6830.22s)]
*  What? I just have a question about the tennis elbow. Can I ask her? You want to? No, no, no. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6835.9s)]
*  Do you know what shot it is? That's causing the most place. I think it's my serve that I'm [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6843.259999999999s)]
*  trying to slice on the serve. And it's just like that motion of doing this. It's just fucking it [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6848.139999999999s)]
*  up. Now I, I was told by a PT that it was, it comes from making that motion. Like that. Yeah. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6854.219999999999s)]
*  You see how that muscles moving right there. But I got on both sides. So I got the outside and [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6864.22s)]
*  in here too. So they said I got golf elbow and tennis. So one is probably overhand. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6870.06s)]
*  Okay. So sorry to interrupt. So once it was guy, he's, this is my worst nightmare. I'm sorry to [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6877.58s)]
*  interrupt again, but like you fall in love with the sport and you're so excited to play it every [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6882.54s)]
*  single day. And then your body limits you from being able to do it is like the most fucking [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6886.78s)]
*  frustrating, heartbreaking thing. You build your whole schedule around doing it. I literally, [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6892.38s)]
*  literally been playing every single day. I know you had the machine. I'm watching you on Instagram. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6897.82s)]
*  This is my worst nightmare. Anytime I like almost sprained my ankle when I'm on the [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6902.62s)]
*  paddleboard, I think about my whole summer, the whole summer flashes in front of me. Okay, go, go, [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6907.1s)]
*  so, um, go to this guy somehow don't know exactly how he's getting around the loopholes of being [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6913.58s)]
*  able to use, um, the STEM cells from what they call sperm. No, the babies are connected to the [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6919.58s)]
*  mother through the umbilical cord. So that is still not FDA approved here. Like people you have to go [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6927.0199999999995s)]
*  to fucking interesting. What about placenta? Placenta stems. So it's like, they have to go [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6933.34s)]
*  to Tijuana now, Columbia, places like that. Columbia I've heard a lot too. Yeah. Somehow [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6938.22s)]
*  he's getting around the system where he's being able to use it. And he's like, tell you what it is. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6941.58s)]
*  All the UFC guys go to him. It's, it's a, he's doing it for research. I was speaking of it. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6947.179999999999s)]
*  If you're doing it for medical research, you're allowed to, in the same way that you're allowed [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6952.62s)]
*  to do medical research with certain, uh, drugs that are federally illegal, experimental procedures. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6957.66s)]
*  So if you can be part of the experimental procedure, then you can do it. Yeah. But it's [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6964.219999999999s)]
*  harder to get in there. That's the thing. Yeah. This guy, he had like his clients. That's why I [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6970.219999999999s)]
*  kind of got a little nervous because his client to like mafia guys, UFC guys, like it's everybody's [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6974.38s)]
*  paying straight cash because it's not an insurance approved and shit like that. So I'm like, [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6979.1s)]
*  I feel about that. I mean, do some exercise, fix the shit. You know, Chris will X. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6984.46s)]
*  Chris, uh, yeah, he's great podcasts. He's, he's, I've done his part. You recognize him from, [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6990.14s)]
*  anyway, he told me he went down to, I think it's public information. He talked about it, [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6996.38s)]
*  but I think he went down to Columbia to do his, I know a bunch of people have done it like real, [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=6999.34s)]
*  I know a dude, uh, good results. Uh, yeah. Yeah. Huge. I know a neighbor who, uh, [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7003.98s)]
*  there's this thing where they, there's a, I think a hospital in New York that flies the whole hospital [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7009.74s)]
*  to an Island. Is it, yeah. I've heard about this. Yeah. Yeah. So it's like, I'm going to make one [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7015.98s)]
*  up in the Caribbean. I don't know which one is, let's say it's Turks and Caicos or something. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7024.459999999999s)]
*  They essentially fly the whole staff and the Island. They get the STEM cells from [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7027.58s)]
*  either Columbia or maybe they get Norwegian STEM cells or Swedish STEM cells, whatever the fuck it [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7032.9400000000005s)]
*  is. And, um, they do the procedures there where it's legal, but they take the entire staff that is [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7037.660000000001s)]
*  from New York. So this is where the, the rich people from New York are like, I don't want to [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7044.860000000001s)]
*  go to no fucking Colombian doctor's office. What are they going to stay in? It might be, it might [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7049.740000000001s)]
*  be. I don't want to say yes, cause I don't know exactly, but like that's, that's where like, [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7055.660000000001s)]
*  that's where these New Yorkers go. I'm scared to go to Brazil and get my shit done. I want a New [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7060.22s)]
*  York doctor to do it. So these New York doctors offices go, we'll build an office that we'll do [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7064.54s)]
*  one week a month. We'll fly you down, do the whole procedure. We put you up in a hotel. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7068.780000000001s)]
*  You recover there. We do everything. You're basically taking a vacation. Your wife is [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7073.820000000001s)]
*  kayaking and hanging out on the beach while you get your STEM cells. And then you guys go back. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7078.3s)]
*  It's like the hair transplant shit. And so it's also fucked up. It's like insurers, um, the medicine [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7081.740000000001s)]
*  companies are trying to block the shit out of this because it will change medicine in a way where [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7089.02s)]
*  they're going to start. Oh, they're going to stop medicating you. Yeah. Right now you can actually [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7094.38s)]
*  fix shit. And then it's like, they make a lot less money. So they've been, he's, he's like, [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7098.3s)]
*  they're going to do that to CRISPR too. They're the ones that are stopping this. Why we can't, [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7104.14s)]
*  why cure Alzheimer's when you can find a medication. Oh, no, like how many people just die. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7108.06s)]
*  I'm telling you, I don't know if he was selling it, but he's like, bro, I see miracles. It's people [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7114.46s)]
*  who are like hobbling and then how does it work? Like, so STEM cells are like, just think of a cell [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7118.9400000000005s)]
*  that hasn't chosen chosen what it's going to be yet. And so you insert it someplace and then it [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7126.7s)]
*  just becomes that cell. So now you have brand new. So it's almost like baby cells, like fresh. They're [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7131.66s)]
*  like, they're not old and not worn. And so then you just like regenerate. Yeah. Pretty much. And [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7139.02s)]
*  regeneration I think is the trickiest thing when it comes to longevity. So like your cells are [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7143.9s)]
*  breaking down since day one and now you're just putting some fresh baby cells in there. Oh fire. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7148.7s)]
*  Yeah. Are they your own STEM cells? No, no. And I think there's like, there's almost like bigotry. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7153.74s)]
*  And I I've heard that like some people are saying like the cell, the STEM cells from these certain [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7159.5s)]
*  places are better. That's hilarious. I want black STEM cells. Yeah. 100%. I'm on again. You would [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7164.379999999999s)]
*  think they were saying this like Norwegian or Swedish ones were cleaner because this, [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7169.74s)]
*  that the other now could be just, that's the thing, right? But it's like, yeah. But it's also like [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7173.82s)]
*  the harvesting process and stuff like that. Cause like you can't even harvest it here. So it's like, [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7179.98s)]
*  so yeah. And then when there's money in anything, people are gonna find a way, but it's also going [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7184.62s)]
*  to be a little, so if it's not regulated in any way, you could get some fugazi shit. Exactly. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7189.34s)]
*  I also think in the early 2000s STEM cells were like a big thing and then Bush, [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7194.139999999999s)]
*  administration, he's so here's the thing. Here's the thing. I wonder if to what Akash was saying, [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7199.34s)]
*  if you're a pharmaceutical company, right? You can't just go say, stop the science because you're a [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7204.620000000001s)]
*  company of science, but what you can do is inflate the groups that are already against this. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7211.660000000001s)]
*  It's going to the religious people, but dude, that's the same as abortion. These are, these [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7216.860000000001s)]
*  are baby lives. What are you, are you going to let them do that? Let them do everything. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7219.580000000001s)]
*  Do you think they're the one pushing that? Quite possible, man. And lobbying. It's like, [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7222.700000000001s)]
*  this is unhealthy. This is like too many, this can cause too many problems. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7227.02s)]
*  Cause it doesn't even make sense that it has anything to do with abortion, [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7231.900000000001s)]
*  but you just tell a couple of fucking retards that and then they're going to run with it [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7235.5s)]
*  because they're retards. There's no logical, you're not killing anything. You're actually [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7239.740000000001s)]
*  extending lives and we can't saving people. We can't give them STEM cells. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7244.46s)]
*  I think, I think what they were saying is they were using some abortions for STEM cells, [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7250.22s)]
*  but if you're not using the abortions, if you're using placenta or if you're using some of these, [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7254.7s)]
*  I think you can use your own, right? Yeah. Well, if you have it, not everybody, [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7258.94s)]
*  but like, I believe that, I believe that was some of the issue there. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7262.62s)]
*  But I think there's ways around it. And if you just let the science advance, [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7266.7s)]
*  they'll find other ways to do it. You just gotta let the science advance. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7269.099999999999s)]
*  Christopher Reeves was a big advocate for STEM cells cause he was paralyzed. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7271.98s)]
*  And then I think he ended up dying. I remember thinking, oh, this is, [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7275.179999999999s)]
*  there's going to be a lot less progress on the STEM cells thing. Cause he's gone. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7278.46s)]
*  It's adrenochrome. It's basically adrenochrome, but accessible. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7281.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. That's far. And not a live show. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7285.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. That's far. So they were right. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7288.3s)]
*  So the lizard people will write about the adrenochrome. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7290.62s)]
*  The frogs are gay. It will help you live forever. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7292.62s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. The adrenochrome is real. That's fun. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7294.46s)]
*  It's kind of sick, dude. That is crazy. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7296.46s)]
*  But have you ever heard of Henrietta Lacks? You ever heard of this? [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7298.14s)]
*  This is like, she was like, her blood is the reason like, like antibiotics. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7300.62s)]
*  Yeah. All that shit. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7306.3s)]
*  Her cancer cells were used. Yeah. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7307.74s)]
*  Here's a little Juneteenth fact for you. Tell me. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7309.9s)]
*  Black lady too. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7311.74s)]
*  Basically this woman, Henrietta Lacks, I don't know all the details, but basically [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7312.62s)]
*  they used her cancer cells, I think against her will, she didn't know about it. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7316.3s)]
*  As like the first, what they say, immortalized human cell line to do medical research. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7321.18s)]
*  So like they did a bunch of research for like the polio vaccine, for like cancer research, [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7326.3s)]
*  AIDS, gene mapping, pharmaceutical testing, all based off of like her genome or some shit. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7330.7s)]
*  But she was like Wolverine or something. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7335.34s)]
*  Something special about her cell regenerate super fast. And it was like almost like a neutral [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7337.9800000000005s)]
*  blood. So you can like test it on just about anything. So it's like, if you want to test [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7343.26s)]
*  how this antibiotic is going to work against this blood, we have to test the same blood [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7347.9800000000005s)]
*  and change the antibiotic. And so because her regenerate so fast, they can just do so many tests [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7353.660000000001s)]
*  and she didn't get any money for this. And her family's pores are this day and they're still [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7359.26s)]
*  trying to do. Did you have to read this book for your own? This was my summer reading book, the [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7363.82s)]
*  life of Henrietta Lacks or something. Did you read about a black woman suffering? [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7369.82s)]
*  It's a great book about she had several cancer and they harvest her cells without her knowing. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7377.34s)]
*  And then they use her cells and call them HeLa cells, Henrietta Lacks cells for like the next [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7384.94s)]
*  50 years. And a lot of like great things have come from those cells, but she never knew. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7390.06s)]
*  And then her family didn't know. And then like some, yeah, just awful story for her. It's fucked up. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7395.1s)]
*  But it was black people that saved the world. American history. Damn, bro. Thank you. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7400.780000000001s)]
*  You can't get a GoFundMe going? Our family should be crazy rich. Yeah, let's get a GoFundMe going. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7405.26s)]
*  Yeah, like when black people complain about cornrows on white people, I'm like, get over it. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7411.1s)]
*  That shit sounds like they should get paid. Yeah. Crazy, right? [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7415.26s)]
*  I guess black people's DNA is what saves the world. Yeah. I mean, if you were going to get [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7420.3s)]
*  something shot into your knees specifically, like I wouldn't put black DNA in your elbows. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7423.900000000001s)]
*  I would put that fucking Djokovic shit. Oh yeah. Like Albanian. What is he like? Serbian or [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7428.9400000000005s)]
*  Slav? Slovenian. Yeah. Put that shit in there. Like depending on the sport injury, I would put, [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7433.820000000001s)]
*  you're Serbian, I would put that type. For real. Yeah. You know? Like what do you like? [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7439.580000000001s)]

*  Yo, there was cameras because I was out there and then the cameras were around downtown. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7483.099999999999s)]
*  It was so funny. Like, I just, everybody tried to get, cause he got to go into the jail, but it's [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VBQJ6nMns&t=7489.5s)]
