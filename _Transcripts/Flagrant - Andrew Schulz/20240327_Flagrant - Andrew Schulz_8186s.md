*  How did the pod with LeBron come to fruition? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=0.0s)]
*  I've known Bron now like 24, 25 years. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2.5s)]
*  We saw each other in December with the folks on his side, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4.8s)]
*  had a conversation, and that got the ball rolling. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7.84s)]
*  So he picked you or you picked him? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=9.8s)]
*  There's no good answer to that. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=11.84s)]
*  Seems like there's a great answer. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=13.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=14.64s)]
*  Is there any heckle that you laughed at? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=16.02s)]
*  During warm-ups, I had noticed there was a group of students [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=17.56s)]
*  sitting front row, and they had t-shirts with my picture on it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=19.82s)]
*  On the picture, it said, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=22.56s)]
*  when I grow up, I want to name my kid JJ Reddick. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=24.1s)]
*  So I went over before the game to get a closer look, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=26.02s)]
*  and then they turned around, and it said, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=28.2s)]
*  and beat him every day. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=29.86s)]

*  I was like, you're out of your fucking mind. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=290.96s)]

*  We got to stop what? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=304.0s)]
*  Racism. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=305.12s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=305.96000000000004s)]
*  JJ, we have to stop racism in America. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=309.36s)]
*  Now that it's affecting us, we got to do something about it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=312.04s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=315.16s)]

*  Do I agree? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=317.68s)]
*  We should stop racism? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=318.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=319.8s)]
*  Okay, thank you. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=320.64s)]
*  Jesus, dude, that's a fucking softball. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=322.4s)]
*  Did you know that I recorded rap songs in college? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=324.4s)]
*  No, we have to hear these. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=327.64s)]
*  I think I have a couple. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=330.12s)]
*  Okay, we might need to bring back some racism. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=330.96s)]
*  Hold on, hold on, I can't get rid of it completely. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=332.03999999999996s)]
*  Hold on, we knew about the poetry. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=334.44s)]
*  Well, so the poetry was really just rap lyrics, right? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=336.71999999999997s)]
*  This is so interesting how racism turns into black poetry. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=339.44s)]
*  When a black guy's a poet, he's a rapper. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=343.71999999999997s)]
*  When a white guy's a rapper, he's a poet. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=345.96s)]
*  Okay, break it down, break it down. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=348.24s)]
*  Again, it wasn't good stuff. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=350.08s)]
*  I actually have some, I just want to point out. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=352.35999999999996s)]
*  It's because they can't catch the real thing. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=354.52s)]
*  From you, I have one of your raps. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=355.35999999999996s)]
*  But anyways, so I didn't have any of the tracks, right? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=357.84s)]
*  And the guy that I recorded with, who was black. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=362.84s)]
*  That was the issue. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=365.0s)]
*  Oh, thank God. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=365.84s)]
*  He was black. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=366.67999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, thank God. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=367.52s)]
*  But we would be in dorm rooms, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=368.35999999999996s)]
*  it was literally a headphone and a mic, right? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=370.12s)]
*  Were you allowed in the same dorm rooms down there? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=375.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, we were. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=376.84s)]
*  That was like 1920, they got rid of that. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=378.2s)]
*  Oh, did they? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=380.12s)]
*  Oh, even at Duke? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=381.20000000000005s)]
*  Oh wow, okay. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=382.44s)]
*  But anyways, so a couple years ago, he's like, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=384.28000000000003s)]
*  dude, I found the songs, and I'm like, send them to me. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=387.96000000000004s)]
*  So he sends them to me. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=391.8s)]
*  And this was 2003. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=393.88000000000005s)]
*  And me and him did a song, it was an anti-racism song. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=396.32000000000005s)]
*  No, I'm joking. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=401.44000000000005s)]
*  JJ. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=403.12s)]
*  I was eight. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=404.92s)]
*  People accused me of being this woke guy. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=406.16s)]
*  I'm the woke guy on ESPN. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=408.56s)]
*  Nah, man, I've always been like that. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=410.6s)]
*  Do you have it? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=413.44s)]
*  Can we listen to it? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=414.28000000000003s)]
*  That one, I don't have on my phone. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=415.12s)]
*  That one you don't have on your phone. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=417.0s)]

*  I love changing it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=421.40000000000003s)]
*  It's an ally system. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=422.24s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=423.08000000000004s)]
*  I actually have to go find, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=425.24s)]
*  because somebody did find some of F.A., [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=426.64s)]
*  who does phenomenal research for us, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=429.0s)]
*  found one of your poems, which might be a rap, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=430.48s)]
*  so maybe we even say it. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=433.48s)]
*  Some of them were more poetic. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=434.32s)]
*  But here's the thing that I need to understand, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=436.36s)]
*  because you were getting heckled [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=438.04s)]
*  an insane amount when you were at Duke. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=441.12s)]
*  You just become this poster child for all the hatred. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=443.20000000000005s)]
*  I think Duke kind of represents, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=445.64000000000004s)]
*  it's not only a race thing, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=447.16s)]
*  I think Duke represents elitism. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=449.28000000000003s)]
*  We look at them, we're like, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=452.20000000000005s)]

*  so here's the thing, they're calling you gay nonstop. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=478.28000000000003s)]
*  And then in order to combat that, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=482.08000000000004s)]
*  you start writing poetry. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=485.0s)]
*  Take us through that. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=486.8s)]
*  Take us through that line of thinking. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=490.04s)]
*  It wasn't just like, it was so weird. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=492.92s)]
*  Maybe I am. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=495.52000000000004s)]
*  So you know NBA players, college players, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=498.36s)]
*  high school players, when you hit a shot, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=501.92s)]
*  sometimes you hold your follow through. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=504.28000000000003s)]
*  And there was this guy at NC State who publicly, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=506.48s)]
*  in an article, said he holds his follow through [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=510.68s)]
*  like he's gay or something. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=513.88s)]
*  I'm like, nothing happened. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=515.28s)]
*  Nothing happened. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=521.12s)]
*  There was no like, hey, we need to cancel that guy. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=522.68s)]
*  It was just like, oh, that's what he said. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=526.68s)]
*  No, he does hold his follow through. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=528.88s)]
*  Yeah, he's kind of gayed away, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=529.72s)]
*  he falls through on his shot. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=530.8s)]
*  It was just different time, different time. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=531.9599999999999s)]
*  Worst though was like, it wasn't, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=535.12s)]
*  there was some stuff I was sensitive about. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=538.68s)]
*  I had bad shoulder acting in college. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=540.1999999999999s)]
*  And so I remember going to a UVA game, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=542.16s)]
*  and they had all these fake Duke number four jerseys, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=544.92s)]
*  and they painted red dots on the shoulders, right? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=547.6s)]
*  And then like the shit at Maryland was like, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=550.96s)]
*  and Florida State too, those two places were like, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=552.96s)]
*  talking about being my 12 year old sister, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=555.4s)]
*  annually being her, like all this stuff [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=558.24s)]
*  about my older sister and my mom. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=560.4s)]
*  So like, there was a lot that wasn't just like, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=562.12s)]
*  oh, this dude's a douche. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=564.64s)]
*  It was like really targeted stuff. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=566.04s)]
*  And I think I may have done it, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=568.08s)]
*  I think I did a thing for ESPN where I was like, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=571.32s)]
*  to combat this, I started writing poetry. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=573.44s)]
*  The reality is I was writing rap lyrics [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=575.76s)]
*  from the time I was like 14 years old. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=579.4s)]

*  you wouldn't say basketball camp. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=584.84s)]
*  We'd get done with the camp, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=586.84s)]
*  and we've got like six hours [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=588.04s)]
*  till like everybody's gonna go to bed, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=589.28s)]
*  and everybody's flying out the next morning. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=593.24s)]
*  We're like, hey guys, should we go like cipher in the room? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=594.9599999999999s)]
*  Like we just fucking freestyle in a battle rap. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=597.92s)]

*  We couldn't be in a real fraternity, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=607.72s)]
*  so we came up with PDF, which was Five Drink a Forty. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=609.44s)]
*  Five Drink a Forty, it was like nine of us, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=613.44s)]

*  there's gonna be younger people probably watching this. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=813.4s)]
*  You were arguably the most, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=815.1999999999999s)]
*  you were the most famous non-MBA player [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=819.84s)]
*  in the world at the time. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=823.28s)]

*  Non-MBA. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=827.96s)]
*  I'm sure there was somebody. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=829.08s)]

*  Great answer, dude. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=832.88s)]
*  Do you not remember what was happening at this time? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=833.88s)]
*  It was insane. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=836.0s)]
*  Pete Sampras was, I remember vividly. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=836.84s)]
*  No, non-MBA basketball player. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=838.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, oh, basketball player. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=839.6s)]
*  And one of the most recognizable figures, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=841.6s)]
*  and this was at a time, I don't think it's as much now. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=843.8000000000001s)]
*  The college game doesn't seem to maintain the start. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=846.6800000000001s)]
*  You went four years. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=849.24s)]
*  Yeah, and my draft class was the first year [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=850.5600000000001s)]
*  you couldn't come out of high school. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=852.6s)]
*  So I was the end of college basketball. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=854.76s)]
*  Not me personally, but I was the last guy to come out [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=859.08s)]
*  before everybody started the one and done thing. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=863.76s)]
*  Kevin Durant was right after me. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=866.6s)]
*  One year, then he went out to the NBA. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=867.88s)]
*  And he wouldn't come out of high school, right? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=871.2800000000001s)]
*  He was good enough to come out of high school. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=872.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=873.2s)]
*  So that was part of it. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=874.24s)]
*  It was still college basketball then. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=876.0400000000001s)]
*  Now I don't know what it is. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=877.7600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, what is it now? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=878.9200000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=880.0s)]
*  Did you watch the UVA game last night? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=880.84s)]
*  No. No. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=882.1600000000001s)]
*  Why? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=883.12s)]
*  They had 14 points in the first half. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=883.96s)]
*  They went nine minutes without scoring, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=885.6800000000001s)]
*  and then 10 minutes later on in the game [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=887.5600000000001s)]
*  without making a field goal. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=889.1600000000001s)]
*  This is the women's game? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=890.0s)]
*  No, this was like a playing game, two 10 seeds. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=891.7600000000001s)]
*  No. Yeah. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=894.7600000000001s)]
*  It was bad, man. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=896.6400000000001s)]
*  And what do you think it is? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=897.6s)]
*  There's no reason for the talent to stick around. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=898.9200000000001s)]
*  They're not even thinking about it. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=902.0s)]
*  G League maybe? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=902.84s)]
*  I don't think it's as G League as much. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=905.32s)]
*  I think, truthfully, the one and done creates [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=906.5200000000001s)]
*  an environment where the best players [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=912.4000000000001s)]
*  are now one and done guys, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=916.2s)]
*  and they never unpack their bags. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=918.36s)]
*  Coach K used to always talk about unpacking your bags, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=919.8800000000001s)]
*  right, being all in. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=921.6800000000001s)]
*  They're mined somewhere else. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=922.96s)]
*  You don't get any continuity. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=924.6s)]
*  The transfer portal now. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=925.96s)]
*  Like Duke, we've gotten a couple transfer portal guys, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=927.36s)]
*  but we still are playing 18 and 19 year old kids, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=931.52s)]
*  and then NC State, the guy that starred for NC State [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=935.44s)]
*  in the ACC tournament is 24 years old. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=938.44s)]
*  He's a full grown man. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=940.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=941.44s)]
*  So it's just, it's a weird game right now. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=942.28s)]
*  Well, have you spoken to Coach K about it all? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=944.6s)]
*  About the NIL and the transfer portal stuff? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=947.36s)]
*  Yeah, or just in general college basketball. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=949.52s)]
*  Does he like this new? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=951.9200000000001s)]
*  I don't think he's a fan. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=954.44s)]
*  I don't think any coach is a fan. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=956.68s)]
*  Yeah, that makes sense. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=957.88s)]
*  How do you feel? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=958.72s)]
*  They all have to re-recruit every year. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=959.56s)]
*  Every year. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=960.48s)]
*  I got a kid, I recruit him in high school. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=961.48s)]
*  He comes in, all right, now I gotta re-recruit him [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=962.96s)]
*  so he doesn't accept the bag from whatever school. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=965.3199999999999s)]

*  is wonderful, but I wanna keep that shit going. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1094.04s)]
*  Thank you guys, I love you, let's get back to the show. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1096.32s)]
*  College basketball back in the day, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1098.92s)]
*  so much more interesting, especially your era. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1101.0800000000002s)]
*  So you get all this scrutiny, it's insane, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1102.92s)]
*  they're saying all this crazy stuff. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1105.0s)]
*  Is there anything funny that people say to you? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1106.18s)]
*  Is there anything that like a heckle that you laughed at? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1107.92s)]
*  So, probably the worst, not the worst, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1111.16s)]
*  cause I didn't think it was that bad, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1115.56s)]
*  but the same game that there were signs talking about [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1116.88s)]
*  Aina Lee being my sister, she was 12. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1122.04s)]
*  That was the same game where at the end of the game, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1125.1200000000001s)]
*  the entire arena, I'm at the free throw line, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1127.88s)]
*  we're up five, I've got basically [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1130.5600000000002s)]
*  like the game ceiling free throws. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1131.88s)]
*  The entire arena is chanting fuck you JJ, right? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1133.3600000000001s)]
*  Fuck you JJ. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1135.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1136.72s)]
*  Fuck you JJ, like that. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1138.0400000000002s)]
*  During warmups, I had noticed there was a group of students [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1141.0600000000002s)]
*  sitting front row, right at half court, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1143.44s)]
*  and they had t-shirts with my picture on it. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1146.3600000000001s)]
*  And on the picture, it said, when I grow up, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1149.1200000000001s)]
*  I wanna name my kid JJ Reddick. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1153.0400000000002s)]
*  So I went over before the game to get a closer look, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1155.0800000000002s)]
*  and then they turned around, and it said, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1158.4s)]
*  and beat him every day. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1159.64s)]
*  I was never condoned in sort of child abuse, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1161.0600000000002s)]
*  but that's clever. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1168.0s)]
*  That's clever. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1168.8400000000001s)]
*  And so I make the free throws, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1171.3200000000002s)]
*  and I go over them at the end of the game, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1173.24s)]
*  and I'm like talking shit, and like, I need a t-shirt, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1175.2s)]
*  give me a fucking t-shirt like that, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1177.44s)]
*  and coach was, he was furious. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1178.88s)]
*  Did it fire you up when they were talking the shit, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1180.5200000000002s)]
*  or was it part of you that wanted to melt [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1182.3200000000002s)]
*  under the pressure of it? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1184.3600000000001s)]
*  No, I didn't want to melt at all. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1185.5200000000002s)]
*  It was like my first 10 games at Duke. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1187.04s)]
*  We had a bunch of home games. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1190.24s)]
*  We played UCLA in Indy in like the Farmers Classic. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1191.36s)]
*  I don't remember what the fuck it was called. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1195.84s)]
*  Then we played Ohio State in Greensboro in the Big Ten ACC, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1197.72s)]
*  and then we played all home games. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1201.12s)]
*  So we come back from Christmas break, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1202.36s)]
*  and we go to Clemson, it's our first real road game, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1204.0s)]
*  it's our first ACC game, and I come out for warmups, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1206.0s)]
*  and it's like, oh. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1209.24s)]
*  This is how. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1210.56s)]
*  Okay, I'm the guy that they've now chosen. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1211.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm the next Duke guy they're gonna hate. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1214.04s)]
*  I had 22 and six that game. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1217.76s)]
*  It was not about melting. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1219.3600000000001s)]
*  It was like, all right, you want me to be an asshole. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1220.48s)]
*  Immaturity, but it was like, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1223.6000000000001s)]
*  you want me to be an asshole, I'll be an asshole. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1224.68s)]
*  What I don't understand is how do you. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1226.32s)]
*  Some of it was deserved. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1227.16s)]
*  I mean, I look back. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1228.0s)]
*  There's a moment in the tournament. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1229.16s)]
*  That's why I want to ask, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1230.48s)]
*  like why were you getting so much hate? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1231.32s)]
*  We're playing Illinois. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1234.48s)]
*  This is the year before they made the final four. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1236.0s)]
*  We made the final four in 0-4. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1238.3600000000001s)]
*  They made it in 0-5. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1239.52s)]
*  So we're playing Illinois in the Sweet 16, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1240.3600000000001s)]
*  and I hit a couple shots in the second half on Luther head, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1242.4s)]
*  and I'm like doing weird shit with my head. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1245.2s)]
*  I'm bobbing my head. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1247.3200000000002s)]
*  I'm doing this. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1248.16s)]
*  I'm smiling and laughing. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1248.98s)]
*  But you're not allowed to enjoy yourself [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1250.8400000000001s)]
*  because you're a white man playing basketball? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1252.16s)]
*  I think Steph changed it for us. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1253.5600000000002s)]
*  I'm serious. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1256.52s)]
*  Steph does that shit all the time. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1257.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1259.44s)]
*  Like, and everybody's cool with it, right? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1260.28s)]
*  It annoys me a little. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1261.68s)]
*  No, there used to be, I mean. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1262.5600000000002s)]
*  There's not a single person [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1265.0400000000002s)]
*  who would say Steph Curry is annoying. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1266.48s)]
*  Yeah, I don't find him annoying. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1268.76s)]
*  You don't like him. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1270.0800000000002s)]
*  I love him. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1271.72s)]
*  I love Steph. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1272.5600000000002s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1273.4s)]
*  You hate his game. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1274.24s)]
*  We've said this many times publicly. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1276.0s)]
*  You hate Steph Curry's game? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1276.84s)]
*  You love Kyrie's game? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1277.8799999999999s)]
*  This is blasphemy. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1279.12s)]
*  I don't understand what this role reversal is. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1281.24s)]
*  Everybody's looking at me. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1282.84s)]
*  Did I say that? [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1283.6799999999998s)]
*  Did I say that? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1284.52s)]
*  I'm gonna have to check it. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1285.36s)]
*  Back in the day, but. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1286.1999999999998s)]
*  I'm gonna have to check. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1287.04s)]
*  We just had it. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1287.8799999999999s)]
*  Back in the day when we talked sports on the podcast. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1288.72s)]
*  Yeah, you used to hate us. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1290.3999999999999s)]
*  That's the last time we talked about it. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1291.24s)]
*  What did I say? [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1292.08s)]
*  I probably had a good argument. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1292.9199999999998s)]
*  Go. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1293.76s)]
*  No, you just didn't like his game, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1294.58s)]
*  that he was just all shooting and nothing else. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1295.4199999999998s)]
*  Oh yeah, but the argument for me was that I can't shoot. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1296.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1299.96s)]
*  It was sarcasm. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1300.8s)]
*  I don't like the fact that the game is now [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1301.82s)]
*  three point shooting. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1303.4199999999998s)]
*  I just go to the basket and I get buckets. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1304.4599999999998s)]
*  So I like the guys who go to the basket [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1307.1799999999998s)]
*  and get buckets like Iverson. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1309.34s)]
*  That was how I played the game. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1310.9799999999998s)]
*  Like Allen Iverson more. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1312.54s)]
*  Wow, but you did hate on him. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1314.62s)]
*  I just love LeBron and he's in the way of LeBron. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1315.82s)]
*  And so I'm like, well, you kept LeBron from getting [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1318.78s)]
*  four more championships or whatever. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1321.58s)]
*  So I've chosen to root against him. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1323.06s)]
*  I'm sure he's an amazing guy. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1325.5s)]
*  I love, I love. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1326.82s)]
*  And he's good at every single thing he does. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1327.6599999999999s)]
*  I just get annoyed that the guy that I want to be [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1329.34s)]
*  the greatest ever could have probably eight championships [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1331.74s)]
*  if it wasn't for the Warriors. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1333.58s)]
*  But you're saying he made celebrating okay. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1334.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1337.02s)]
*  Got it, okay. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1337.86s)]
*  I'm wondering if there's anybody before him. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1338.7s)]
*  No, I feel like a lot of people made it before him. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1339.52s)]
*  Like all the. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1341.62s)]
*  No, but it was like. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1342.94s)]
*  He had to be dunking and shit like that, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1343.78s)]
*  I think is his point. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1345.18s)]
*  I'm just a shooter. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1346.02s)]
*  Being a shooter wasn't ever cool in our childhood. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1346.86s)]
*  Name a cool three point shooter. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1348.6599999999999s)]
*  Reggie Miller wasn't cool. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1350.5s)]
*  I loved Reggie. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1351.54s)]
*  Reggie Miller was hated. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1352.3799999999999s)]
*  I'm not hated. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1353.3s)]
*  He loved it all the shit. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1354.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he was hated. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1354.98s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1355.8s)]
*  Right? [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1356.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but people hated Reggie. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1357.48s)]
*  So shooting wasn't cool. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1359.98s)]
*  I didn't hate Reggie. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1360.8200000000002s)]
*  In Telstaff. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1361.66s)]
*  I loved Reggie. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1362.48s)]
*  Where do you get the confidence though? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1363.3200000000002s)]
*  That's what I'm trying to understand. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1364.14s)]
*  Like where do you get the confidence to handle [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1364.98s)]
*  that kind of hate and scrutiny? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1366.42s)]
*  Yeah, when you're a 19 year old. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1367.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1368.7800000000002s)]
*  You know, I would say it was not confidence. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1369.74s)]
*  There was the competitive part, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1374.8600000000001s)]
*  which was very much easy. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1376.7800000000002s)]
*  Like I'm in the arena. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1380.66s)]
*  I'm on a court doing what I love. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1383.5400000000002s)]
*  That was easy. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1386.26s)]
*  The confidence part, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1387.5s)]
*  we haven't fully developed our egos at 18, 19 years old. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1389.38s)]
*  I don't think it was confidence at all. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1393.3s)]
*  It was actually insecurity. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1394.9s)]
*  I mean, I had to start seeing it. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1398.62s)]
*  I saw a therapist every week for three years at Duke. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1400.06s)]
*  From my sophomore year on. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1402.74s)]
*  And it was because of like, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1404.96s)]
*  this whole notion, like I grew up a Duke fan. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1406.98s)]
*  I wanted to go to Duke. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1409.06s)]
*  Seven years old, I watched late and I hit the shot. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1410.26s)]
*  Mom and dad, I'm gonna go play at Duke, right? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1411.94s)]
*  I wanna go to Duke. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1413.42s)]
*  And I get to Duke and I'm like, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1414.7s)]
*  oh, this shit's fucking hard. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1415.66s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1417.94s)]
*  Not only that part of it, the scrutiny, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1418.78s)]
*  but playing at Duke was hard. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1421.26s)]
*  It was a mental fuck every day. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1424.42s)]
*  People get their, they bring their A game every day. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1426.26s)]
*  I got tested every single day. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1428.3799999999999s)]
*  For? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1430.1s)]
*  Oh, for whatever. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1431.5s)]
*  Body language, chewing gum, you're chewing gum. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1432.74s)]
*  My senior year, I set the ACC scoring record against Temple [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1436.46s)]
*  and they played a box and one on me. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1440.5s)]
*  They had a guy, Marty Collins, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1445.14s)]
*  who I'd played USA basketball with the season before. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1446.38s)]
*  And Marty was like, he's like, hey man, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1448.3000000000002s)]
*  John Chaney said, you're not getting the record today. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1451.0600000000002s)]
*  We're throwing the whole fucking kitchen sink at you. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1453.3000000000002s)]
*  We're gonna play box and one. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1455.14s)]
*  I needed like 11 points, right? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1456.5s)]
*  So I ended up scoring like 13 or whatever it was. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1459.18s)]
*  They played a box and one the whole game. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1462.7800000000002s)]
*  We win the game, we go to film session the next day. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1463.8600000000001s)]
*  And occasionally in my career, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1466.9s)]
*  when I would have like a okay first half or bad first half, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1467.94s)]
*  I'd put a piece of gum in my mouth [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1471.18s)]
*  just to like change things up. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1473.42s)]
*  It's like a superstition, right? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1474.74s)]
*  And coach the next day in the film session [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1477.3s)]
*  stops early in the second half and he's like, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1478.62s)]
*  what the fuck are you doing? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1481.1799999999998s)]
*  Chewing gum. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1482.3s)]
*  Your head was not right. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1484.6999999999998s)]
*  And I was like, was it bad or was it the box and one? [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1485.54s)]
*  Yeah, it might be the box and one. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1488.6999999999998s)]
*  So it was like shit like that. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1490.3s)]
*  It was just constant, right? [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1492.9399999999998s)]
*  So through that process, I think ultimately it prepared me [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1495.4599999999998s)]
*  for the NBA because the NBA ended up being easy. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1501.3799999999999s)]
*  You followed with, oh sorry, go. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1503.8999999999999s)]
*  What was your reception when you first got to the NBA? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1505.54s)]
*  Coming from this school. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1507.14s)]
*  The NBA wasn't easy, I shouldn't say that. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1508.54s)]
*  The NBA was easier. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1510.1s)]
*  Was there any friction with other players who were like, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1512.46s)]
*  oh that's this fucking cocky kid, I'm gonna humble him? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1514.46s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, for sure. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1516.54s)]
*  My teammates. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1517.74s)]
*  Did they call you milk? [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1520.06s)]
*  Were they like milk? [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1520.98s)]
*  Did they milk check you? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1523.82s)]
*  That sometimes happens in football. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1524.66s)]
*  Did they milk check me? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1526.86s)]
*  What is that? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1528.14s)]
*  I've never heard of that. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1528.98s)]
*  So if there's like a white player out there, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1529.82s)]
*  they're like milk and then if there's a white like DB, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1530.98s)]
*  for example. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1533.54s)]
*  You yell at your quarterback, you go milk check, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1534.74s)]
*  and then the quarterback looks and sees the guy guarding [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1536.66s)]
*  you as white and then you just go long. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1538.46s)]
*  No, I didn't get that. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1540.02s)]
*  You never got milk checked? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1542.6200000000001s)]
*  No, I mean I got targeted. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1543.46s)]
*  Yeah, on defense. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1546.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1547.5s)]
*  Every single play? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1548.42s)]
*  No, not every single play, but early in my career [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1549.42s)]
*  and then late in my career. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1551.5800000000002s)]
*  I got targeted a lot. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1552.5s)]
*  And are your teammates going beyond normal Ricky Hazen [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1554.18s)]
*  because you're you or is it just like, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1556.14s)]
*  and what are they doing? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1558.06s)]
*  It was all normal. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1561.94s)]
*  I like was late for a couple of practices [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1563.74s)]
*  and the second time they tied me to a chair. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1565.7s)]
*  Normal. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1569.98s)]
*  With my clothes on and shoved me in a cold shower [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1571.34s)]
*  then left me there. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1573.66s)]
*  This is in Orlando? [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1576.54s)]
*  Yeah, this was in Orlando. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1577.54s)]
*  Who did Dwight stay in the shower with you? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1578.66s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1580.98s)]
*  I should have told you. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1584.1s)]
*  Show up Dwight. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1584.94s)]
*  Dwight's like I have a great idea. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1586.78s)]
*  Honestly. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1588.18s)]
*  Let's strip him naked and throw him in a shower. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1589.02s)]
*  The reason I say that it was easier though [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1590.94s)]
*  is because the Duke experience, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1592.62s)]
*  whether it was just the scrutiny and the hatred, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1596.1s)]
*  whatever you want to call it, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1599.86s)]
*  and playing for Duke and the intensity of that day to day. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1601.58s)]
*  It was like you get to the pros and it's like, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1605.3s)]
*  okay, I know how to navigate these things now. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1607.5s)]
*  I'm well equipped to navigate the pressures [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1610.1s)]
*  and the competition and all the shit that comes with it. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1612.8999999999999s)]
*  And I guess you're not the biggest name in the NBA. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1615.3s)]
*  You're the biggest name in the NCAA. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1616.8999999999999s)]
*  But in the NBA they got LeBron. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1618.86s)]
*  I didn't expect to be. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1620.54s)]
*  I remember I was doing the 21 under world championships [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1622.66s)]
*  in Argentina going into my senior year [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1627.7s)]
*  and Hoops Hype wanted to talk to me. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1630.38s)]
*  And one of the reporters wanted to talk to me. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1632.58s)]
*  And so the USA Basketball comms person was like, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1634.02s)]
*  can you get on the phone with this person? [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1636.1s)]
*  And I remember them asking me about my expectation level [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1637.78s)]
*  for the NBA. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1640.58s)]
*  And I started, that was the same year [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1642.1s)]
*  I started taking Italian at Duke. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1644.54s)]
*  Because I'd be like, it'd be cool to go play overseas. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1646.02s)]
*  I had no expectation of a long NBA career. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1648.5s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, if I get to the next level, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1652.02s)]
*  I don't expect to be a star. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1654.26s)]
*  I'll be a role player. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1655.3400000000001s)]
*  Okay, so you knew that going in. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1656.46s)]
*  I wanna talk about NBA in a second. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1657.74s)]
*  But I first wanna talk about high school. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1659.98s)]
*  You're playing basketball in high school. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1663.22s)]
*  And I imagine it feels like you're a superhero, right? [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1665.9s)]
*  Like you score whenever you want. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1669.8600000000001s)]
*  I just need to understand what that's like. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1672.06s)]
*  Every single time the ball's going to you, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1674.74s)]
*  every single time you put it up, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1676.98s)]
*  and nobody's upset about the shot, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1679.1399999999999s)]
*  is it the easiest game? [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1681.5s)]
*  Is it exciting? [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1682.78s)]
*  Does it get boring? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1683.62s)]
*  What is high school when you are the best? [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1685.18s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1689.74s)]
*  So high school and AAU are two different things. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1691.1s)]
*  So my freshman year, I played varsity. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1693.82s)]
*  And I averaged like 17 a game. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1698.06s)]
*  And then I went and played 17 and under. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1700.4199999999998s)]
*  So like that's all rising seniors. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1703.3s)]
*  I went and played 17 and under with Boo Williams, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1705.06s)]
*  which was the other side of the state. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1707.1s)]
*  Didn't know any of the guys, didn't know Boo. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1708.82s)]
*  I had a person who had reached out to Boo and was like, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1710.8999999999999s)]
*  hey, do you need a shooter for the summer tournaments? [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1714.06s)]
*  So I meet them in Atlanta. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1716.6599999999999s)]
*  That experience, that was hard. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1719.1399999999999s)]
*  Because I'm going against DeJuan Wagner. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1721.26s)]
*  I'm going against Tyson Chandler, D. Wade, Darius Miles. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1723.5s)]
*  All those guys are rising seniors. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1726.3s)]
*  So that was hard. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1729.2199999999998s)]
*  I went to a public school in Southwest Virginia. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1731.1799999999998s)]
*  So like game to game, yeah, it was like, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1734.22s)]
*  it wasn't like I was ever on cruise control. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1737.74s)]
*  Cause it was like, but it was easy to score 20. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1739.5s)]
*  You could do whatever the fuck you wanted. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1741.34s)]
*  Yeah, but I couldn't because I had a great high school coach. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1743.3s)]
*  Okay, so the coach is limited. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1746.38s)]
*  But if you want to put up 50 a game, do you think that? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1747.5s)]
*  The most I scored in high school was 43. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1751.38s)]
*  That was the most shots I took in a high school game was 25. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1754.14s)]
*  Was the state championship my senior year. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1757.7s)]
*  The most shots I took in high school was 25. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1759.54s)]
*  I was not like, come down and catch it. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1761.98s)]
*  Let's say you were like DeJuan Wagner [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1764.18s)]
*  where they're basically just going every single play, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1765.54s)]
*  do whatever you want. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1767.5s)]
*  50 easy? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1768.8600000000001s)]
*  I'm just trying to understand how easy high school [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1770.26s)]
*  basketball is when you're a superstar. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1772.1000000000001s)]
*  Again, I think it's like night to night. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1775.3000000000002s)]
*  If I said to myself, I'm going to get 30 tonight, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1778.42s)]
*  I'm going to get 30. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1781.02s)]
*  That easy? [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1782.42s)]
*  Yeah, easy. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1783.38s)]
*  Okay. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1784.22s)]
*  Yeah, especially junior, senior year. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1785.0600000000002s)]
*  By that time, like I'm grown, I'm fully developed [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1786.5800000000002s)]
*  as like a high school player. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1789.6200000000001s)]
*  Nobody could bully you. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1790.7s)]
*  Yeah, I was like, that was easy. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1791.6200000000001s)]
*  Okay, so you made it. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1793.94s)]
*  But I also like, the other thing, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1794.78s)]
*  again, Billy Hicks, my high school coach, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1796.18s)]
*  we played a very specific motion system. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1798.38s)]
*  He had gotten this, I think we called it thumb up. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1802.74s)]
*  It was like four across the elbow and the free throw line. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1806.3400000000001s)]
*  So wings, two guys at the elbow, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1810.78s)]
*  and it was just a movement set. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1812.98s)]
*  Like a Stanford offense or whatever that is? [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1814.3400000000001s)]
*  Oh, that's Princeton. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1816.74s)]
*  Princeton, that's like back doors. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1817.5800000000002s)]
*  This was more like curls into pin downs, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1819.3s)]
*  curls into pin downs. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1822.26s)]
*  So like I learned how to play off the ball in high school. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1823.3799999999999s)]
*  We didn't run like high pick and rolls or ISO basketball. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1826.54s)]
*  And so we all kind of ate in that system. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1829.8999999999999s)]
*  It wasn't like- [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1832.34s)]
*  It wasn't geared toward- [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1833.18s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1834.26s)]
*  I had a couple of plays, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1836.06s)]
*  like I would get an ISO on the left block. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1837.1399999999999s)]
*  If they need a buff. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1838.94s)]
*  And then if I got hot, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1839.78s)]
*  I would just kind of like give my coach a look. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1840.86s)]
*  I remember like my senior night, Coach K came, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1843.1s)]
*  I was coming off an injury. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1846.1399999999999s)]
*  We were playing at one of our rivals in our district. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1848.18s)]
*  And I got hot in the first half. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1850.42s)]
*  And I kind of like looked at him and he's like- [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1852.54s)]
*  Let him go. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1854.94s)]
*  Which was basically my clearance to get a heat check in. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1855.78s)]
*  Okay, okay, okay. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1858.42s)]
*  So this is one of the questions I have. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1859.5s)]
*  And I do want to talk about NBA stuff. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1860.94s)]
*  And there's tons of people I want to talk about [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1862.42s)]
*  in the NBA, but is getting hot real? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1863.8600000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1867.78s)]
*  Cause I'm sure you've spoken to the analytics guys. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1868.9s)]
*  And they say there is no such thing as getting hot. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1871.26s)]
*  Momentum's not real. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1872.98s)]
*  Whatever, blah, blah, blah. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1873.8200000000002s)]
*  But you felt it. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1875.14s)]
*  I'm sure you remember the times in your career [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1877.3s)]
*  where you feel it. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1879.3s)]
*  What is getting hot? [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1880.3s)]
*  Do you know what flow state is? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1881.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1883.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1883.94s)]
*  It's just flow state. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1884.78s)]
*  So it's no thinking. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1885.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1886.44s)]
*  Doing. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1887.28s)]
*  Your body, it's every shot, every motion. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1888.12s)]
*  It's just like perfect muscle memory. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1891.74s)]
*  There were games, I'm being serious when I say this. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1893.46s)]
*  There were games where I would shoot like eight for 12. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1896.46s)]
*  And I'd be like, man, my shot didn't feel good tonight. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1900.82s)]
*  And then there could be a game where I shot eight for 16. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1903.74s)]
*  And I was like, I was in the flow state tonight. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1908.14s)]
*  Cause it's like, again, at that level in the NBA, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1909.98s)]
*  your margin at my size is like. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1913.6000000000001s)]
*  That's why the analytics guys don't get it. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1915.98s)]
*  Cause they're looking at the data. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1917.54s)]
*  I did a senior project in stats on the idea [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1918.82s)]
*  of like the hot hand. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1923.54s)]
*  And at the time it was very much undisputed. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1926.46s)]
*  There was no such thing. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1930.02s)]
*  And so I do the project and I came to the same conclusion. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1931.42s)]
*  And of course now I think pretty much that has been debunked. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1935.46s)]
*  There was a book about it a few years ago [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1938.74s)]
*  about the theory of the hot hand. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1942.8600000000001s)]
*  And it was pretty much debunked. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1944.58s)]
*  It was debunked that there is no such thing as that. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1945.82s)]
*  No, there is. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1947.6200000000001s)]
*  There is a hot hand. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1948.46s)]
*  Oh, that they actually can prove it. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1949.3s)]
*  But no, the idea that there isn't a hot hand. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1950.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the idea that there isn't a real et cetera. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1950.96s)]
*  Got it. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1952.5s)]
*  There is a hot hand, for sure. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1953.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so we believe it. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1954.16s)]
*  There is data to back it up. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1955.0s)]
*  Was there a way? [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1955.8400000000001s)]
*  When you're on stage, man, you know it. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1956.68s)]
*  100%. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1958.5s)]
*  Like when you're on stage, you know. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1959.3400000000001s)]
*  Perfect connection. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1960.18s)]
*  You know exactly, when you're killing it, you know it. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1961.02s)]
*  You're not operating in the deficit. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1964.14s)]
*  You're not worried about what's going wrong. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1965.5s)]
*  You are fully present and you are locked in. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1966.98s)]
*  Was there a way for you to access it frequently [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1969.1s)]
*  or was it just random? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1970.74s)]
*  There were ways to try. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1973.26s)]
*  A lot of it became about like the prep, the routine. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1975.82s)]
*  Even going back to high school, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1978.86s)]
*  I was always like a visualization person. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1980.38s)]
*  So I had this free period and I would walk through the gym. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1982.46s)]
*  And I don't know why, because we had an auxiliary gym. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1987.46s)]
*  I don't think there was really ever like gym class [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1990.26s)]
*  by the time you were like a junior or senior. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1992.94s)]
*  It's like I would walk through the gym on game days [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1994.74s)]
*  and I would like picture the spots on the court [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1997.3400000000001s)]
*  and I'd leave the gym. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=1999.3400000000001s)]
*  And then for the rest of the day, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2000.18s)]
*  I'm visualizing coming off of pin downs. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2001.14s)]
*  I'm visualizing my footwork. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2003.46s)]
*  I'm visualizing like the angle [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2005.1000000000001s)]
*  with which I wanna release the ball, where the defender is. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2006.78s)]
*  I always had the ability to do that. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2009.28s)]
*  And so that was one of my sort of like preps [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2011.54s)]
*  to get into the flow state. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2013.7s)]
*  That was one of the preps. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2015.02s)]
*  Even at like 16, 17 years old, you're doing that. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2015.8600000000001s)]
*  I'm probably doing like 15, yeah. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2017.5s)]
*  But Steph, Steph is able to access better [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2019.62s)]
*  than any basketball player. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2022.36s)]
*  It's kind of miraculous. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2023.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, unbelievable. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2024.82s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2025.6599999999999s)]
*  He's, you know something that's interesting about like, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2026.4799999999998s)]
*  the Steph, I got to watch Steph up close [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2029.62s)]
*  when we were in San Francisco doing shooting shows. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2034.8999999999999s)]
*  And I don't think his speed translates on TV. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2037.3s)]
*  When you see him up front, he is by far the fastest. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2042.36s)]
*  It's like no one's even close, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2047.1s)]
*  but on TV, it seems like the game is operating [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2049.32s)]
*  in slow motion. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2052.76s)]
*  It's the same thing with like Brunson. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2053.76s)]
*  I'm like, I'm watching Brunson be so fucking effective, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2055.1200000000003s)]
*  get to whatever position he wants to get to, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2058.1200000000003s)]
*  but I don't see him as like a freakishly fast dude. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2060.44s)]
*  So I'm trying to understand what creates game speed. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2063.42s)]
*  All right, so I'm gonna actually grab this real quick. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2067.96s)]
*  If you don't mind. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2071.84s)]
*  Yeah, you got something for us? [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2072.6600000000003s)]
*  He's gotta take a call. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2073.5s)]
*  No, no, I gotta call you. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2074.32s)]
*  I just gotta find it on my phone. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2075.76s)]
*  He got some whole lyrics for you, bro. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2076.6000000000004s)]
*  You got bars for us? [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2078.44s)]
*  Can you explain this? [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2079.68s)]
*  No, I just wanna get all this stuff in here. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2080.52s)]
*  So this idea of like an athlete in basketball, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2082.0s)]
*  basketball athleticism. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2086.04s)]
*  So what goes into that? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2088.04s)]
*  So historically or traditionally, I should say, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2088.92s)]
*  we think of basketball athletes [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2091.8s)]
*  as being vertical and linear, right? [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2093.4s)]
*  Fast and up. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2096.92s)]
*  All right, so these are the things [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2099.04s)]
*  that go into being a great basketball athlete. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2101.2400000000002s)]
*  Change of direction, balance, coordination, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2103.84s)]
*  change of pace. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2107.36s)]
*  We talked about the deceleration before we started, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2108.94s)]
*  which is the most fascinating thing in today's NBA. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2110.4199999999996s)]
*  Strength, vertical plane, pliability, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2113.06s)]
*  which is just flexibility, mobility, reflexes, stamina. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2115.58s)]
*  And then the cognitive side of that [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2120.14s)]
*  is pattern recognition, spatial awareness, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2121.5s)]
*  which is an easy way to say court mapping. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2123.5s)]
*  Nikola Jokic court maps, anticipation, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2126.58s)]
*  and then cognitive load. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2130.1s)]
*  That's the mental bandwidth piece. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2131.14s)]
*  How many things can you process at once? [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2132.54s)]
*  At the same time, yeah. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2134.1s)]
*  Right? [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2134.94s)]
*  So it goes back to what you said about me as an athlete [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2135.76s)]
*  when we first started. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2139.96s)]
*  Like, I am not a great athlete in the NBA. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2140.84s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2144.6400000000003s)]
*  Relative to the average person, I'm a great, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2145.5200000000004s)]
*  I'm in the 1%. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2147.8s)]
*  But I'm not in the 1% of the 1% of the, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2149.0s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2151.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2151.96s)]
*  So all these guys that you're like, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2152.8s)]
*  how do you explain it? [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2154.5600000000004s)]
*  It's because they have all of this shit. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2155.6800000000003s)]
*  Maybe they don't have vertical. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2158.0800000000004s)]
*  Maybe they don't have linear. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2159.2200000000003s)]
*  Luka Doncic is not a vertical or linear athlete. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2160.5200000000004s)]
*  But he's got breaks. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2163.0800000000004s)]
*  Best breaks in the fucking world. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2164.32s)]
*  And can you explain why breaks make it so effective? [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2165.96s)]
*  Well, so what he does, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2168.8s)]
*  actually this is what I wanted to talk to you about. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2172.7200000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2174.4s)]
*  All right, so what he does is like, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2175.2400000000002s)]
*  there's a constant change of pace. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2176.84s)]
*  He's on balance. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2180.6800000000003s)]
*  He's trying to get you off balance. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2182.7200000000003s)]
*  Once you're off balance, he's still on balance. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2185.0s)]
*  He changes his pace. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2187.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2188.7200000000003s)]
*  He has created an advantage at that point. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2189.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2192.44s)]
*  Now he's got you on his hip. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2193.28s)]
*  Essentially, he's blown by you. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2195.1600000000003s)]
*  Maybe you reach in, he goes through, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2196.8s)]
*  he can draw the foul, whatever. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2198.28s)]
*  But let's say you catch up to him. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2199.6800000000003s)]
*  You're now going in acceleration full speed [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2201.36s)]
*  and he goes into deceleration, you fly by. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2204.8s)]
*  So on his drives, his ability to decelerate is special. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2207.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2211.48s)]
*  And he's very effective [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2212.32s)]
*  without having to create immediate acceleration. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2214.6800000000003s)]
*  Like I remember, and I'm not in any way [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2218.7400000000002s)]
*  comparing myself to him, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2220.84s)]
*  but I remember for me, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2222.26s)]
*  in order to have any competitive advantage [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2223.6600000000003s)]
*  when I was playing, I had to make a commitment [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2225.5s)]
*  to going to the basket after one move [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2228.78s)]
*  and put everything into it [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2230.86s)]
*  because I didn't have that extra, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2232.46s)]
*  I had a maybe decent first set, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2234.0600000000004s)]
*  but I'm committed 100%. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2235.42s)]
*  Now at that commitment 100%, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2238.1400000000003s)]
*  I didn't have the brakes to stop if the guy was with me. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2239.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2243.38s)]
*  But that was the only way that I knew. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2244.38s)]
*  And when I started to play at higher levels [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2245.78s)]
*  and guys could stay with me, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2247.1800000000003s)]
*  it was way more difficult for me to score. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2248.3s)]
*  To see him do it at like medium speed, it feels like. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2250.78s)]
*  And the second you're on his hip, it's over. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2256.7400000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2258.94s)]
*  So it's not like he needs to blow by you. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2259.78s)]
*  He just needs you here. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2262.34s)]
*  Once he gets you off balance, it's easy. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2264.78s)]
*  And he's 6'8". [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2266.38s)]
*  That's it, yeah, yeah. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2267.98s)]
*  30-ish, depending on the day. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2268.82s)]
*  Seems incredibly strong. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2271.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, his lower body's insane. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2272.1800000000003s)]
*  Okay, so what about- [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2273.78s)]
*  His lower body's insane. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2274.6200000000003s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, what do you mean? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2275.44s)]
*  Like all his legs. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2276.6200000000003s)]
*  Oh yeah, it's strength. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2278.34s)]
*  So that's the brakes. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2279.38s)]
*  Yeah, what I was gonna say about Brunson [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2281.1000000000004s)]
*  and Lucas in this category, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2282.86s)]
*  and I put Kyrie in this category, [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2284.1400000000003s)]
*  is I was thinking last night before I went to bed, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2285.58s)]
*  because I watched some of the Mavs game against the Spurs, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2289.3s)]
*  and then once the Nuggets game came on, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2292.02s)]
*  I really wanted to watch that game. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2293.58s)]
*  So I watched the full Nuggets-Teebles game, [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2294.6800000000003s)]
*  and I was laying in bed, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2296.5s)]
*  and I was thinking about how we break down certain players, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2298.2200000000003s)]
*  and what a scouting report is on a certain player. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2302.02s)]
*  And for some guys, it's like, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2304.94s)]
*  I had a very simple scouting report, right? [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2306.26s)]
*  But for some guys, it's like- [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2307.94s)]
*  What was yours? [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2309.3s)]
*  You have to be aware of where he is at all times. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2311.3s)]
*  He's in constant motion. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2313.34s)]
*  I like to turn over my left shoulder. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2314.94s)]
*  You could force him out to the right side [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2316.46s)]
*  where he turns over his right shoulder. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2317.98s)]
*  Turn over your left shoulder means [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2319.1400000000003s)]
*  you're getting the ball. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2321.3s)]
*  So the basket's that way. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2322.7400000000002s)]
*  I wanted to turn this way over my left shoulder. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2323.78s)]
*  So you're coming around. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2325.6600000000003s)]
*  So the defender's on this side. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2326.7400000000002s)]
*  My right hand is here. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2328.6600000000003s)]
*  You can't get to the ball. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2329.5s)]
*  I turn the other way. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2330.7000000000003s)]
*  Short arms, alligator arms, negative wingspan. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2332.54s)]
*  But I was thinking about certain guys, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2336.1400000000003s)]
*  where it's like, all right, this guy in isolation, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2336.98s)]
*  he likes to go left. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2340.02s)]
*  This guy, if he's playing a pick and roll, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2342.3399999999997s)]
*  he wants to come to his right hand. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2345.7s)]
*  He's gonna shoot a one-two dribble pull-up. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2347.02s)]
*  This guy's better finishing right. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2348.62s)]
*  There's some guys that just defy breakdown. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2350.2599999999998s)]
*  Luka defies a breakdown. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2353.3399999999997s)]
*  What is his scouting report? [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2355.5s)]
*  Jalen Brunson, by the way, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2357.5s)]
*  I've watched him over the last two years, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2359.2599999999998s)]
*  and I played with Jalen. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2360.8199999999997s)]
*  I knew he was good. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2361.66s)]
*  I did not know he was gonna be this good. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2362.98s)]
*  Jalen Brunson, it's like, is there an answer for him? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2364.66s)]
*  Because he can score going right. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2367.54s)]
*  He can score going left. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2370.2200000000003s)]
*  He can shoot threes off the dribble. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2371.06s)]
*  He can shoot, catch, and shoot. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2372.46s)]
*  What makes Jalen so good, going back to that, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2373.9s)]
*  he's got a lot of those qualities, right? [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2376.66s)]
*  I don't think he's the fastest guy. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2379.1s)]
*  Certainly not a vertical athlete. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2380.7400000000002s)]
*  He's always on balance. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2382.62s)]
*  And he does everything, every trick, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2384.46s)]
*  the footwork, the body shifts, the handle. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2387.38s)]
*  He does everything to get you off balance, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2391.3s)]
*  but he's never off balance. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2393.14s)]
*  The handle's underrated, too. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2394.54s)]
*  That's another thing. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2395.62s)]
*  Incredible control of the ball [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2396.46s)]
*  and ability to change directions. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2398.06s)]
*  And he has that kind of almost like, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2399.9s)]
*  remember IT's dribble? [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2402.54s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2404.86s)]
*  You know where it's like, he kind of lulls you to sleep [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2405.7s)]
*  almost, and then first step, see you later. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2408.42s)]
*  I feel like Jalen's got a little bit of that. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2410.62s)]
*  Do you know what a keep action is? [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2414.46s)]
*  No. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2415.62s)]
*  A keep action. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2416.54s)]
*  So, Draymond Green does this a lot. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2417.38s)]
*  So, you throw him the ball, and you go to chase it. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2420.1s)]
*  Or he goes into a dribble handoff on the other side. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2424.3s)]
*  A dribble handoff is just meaning you dribble at somebody, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2426.2599999999998s)]
*  and you hand it off, right? [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2428.86s)]
*  So, when you, a keep action is you dribble at somebody, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2429.7000000000003s)]
*  your guy then tries to help, and you just keep it and go. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2432.9s)]
*  So, Jalen Brunson will bring the ball up [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2436.98s)]
*  on the right side of the floor, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2439.7000000000003s)]
*  and he will go to a dribble handoff with the other guard, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2441.34s)]
*  and he'll do this, and just keep it, right? [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2444.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2446.86s)]
*  I'm at a game. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2447.9s)]
*  I have a friend who has courtside seats, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2448.78s)]
*  so he invited me, and we're at a game. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2450.46s)]
*  And I'm sitting courtside across from the Knicks bench. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2453.2200000000003s)]
*  Looking at Tibbs, Knicks are going that way. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2458.5s)]
*  Everyone is sort of backpedaling near Tibbs. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2461.38s)]
*  And Tibbs calls seven keep, [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2464.38s)]
*  or whatever they call their keep action. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2466.7400000000002s)]
*  Audibly, anyone sitting there can hear it. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2469.46s)]
*  Hear exactly the... [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2472.86s)]
*  And I'm like, Jalen Brunson, keep action. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2473.98s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2475.7400000000002s)]
*  And Jalen Brunson, bird drill at the right side, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2476.66s)]
*  does his thing, keep action, wide open layup. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2478.26s)]
*  I'm like, how? [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2481.02s)]
*  Yeah, how? [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2482.66s)]
*  Memphis was playing a bunch of G League guys, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2484.42s)]
*  so that was part of it. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2486.1s)]
*  But also, you know what's coming. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2488.14s)]
*  The best players, you know what they really want to get to, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2490.2999999999997s)]
*  and you can't stop them. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2495.5s)]
*  And they still get to it. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2496.3399999999997s)]
*  They still get to it. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2497.18s)]
*  Michael Jordan wanted to get to his right hand. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2498.02s)]
*  And it's gonna go. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2499.38s)]
*  Have you seen this shit? [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2500.22s)]
*  What they... [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2501.3399999999997s)]
*  Are we done with the 90s? [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2502.18s)]
*  Joe, I hate this. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2503.02s)]
*  Who's paying for this? [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2504.74s)]
*  This is your podcast co-host. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2505.7799999999997s)]
*  There's a... [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2508.54s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2509.38s)]
*  There's a media smear campaign out there for Michael Jordan, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2510.22s)]
*  and there's all these people that are taking these clips [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2515.02s)]
*  and saying how trash basketball was in the 90s, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2517.62s)]
*  as if we didn't fucking watch it. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2520.46s)]
*  You thought it was trash? [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2522.5s)]
*  No. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2523.58s)]
*  So MJ does whatever he wants now. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2524.42s)]
*  And they tried to say MJ doesn't have a left hand, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2526.42s)]
*  and then they broke it down, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2528.42s)]
*  and it's like he goes to the left [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2529.46s)]
*  just as much as he goes to the right now. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2530.66s)]
*  This is a smear campaign. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2532.7s)]
*  This is a smear campaign. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2533.54s)]
*  I don't love this. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2534.78s)]
*  Because of some things that have happened on First Take, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2537.82s)]
*  and The Old Man on the Three, which is my other podcast, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2540.58s)]
*  because of some things that I've said, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2543.82s)]
*  I have this reputation as destroying the older generation, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2545.42s)]
*  and it's like... [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2548.94s)]
*  What did you call them? [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2550.02s)]
*  Janitors? [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2550.86s)]
*  Plumbers and firemen. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2551.78s)]
*  There we go. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2552.6200000000003s)]
*  But here's everything I've ever said is based in fact. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2554.5s)]
*  What are the facts here? [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2558.5800000000004s)]
*  That Michael Jordan's a fireman? [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2560.1400000000003s)]
*  In the night, no. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2561.98s)]
*  I was talking specifically about the players [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2562.82s)]
*  that Bob Cousy played against in the 1950s. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2565.6200000000003s)]
*  Okay, this is different. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2567.94s)]
*  In the 1950s, nearly every professional athlete [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2569.2200000000003s)]
*  in every sport... [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2572.5s)]
*  What? [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2574.1600000000003s)]
*  Don't get me started on the quota. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2575.0s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2576.56s)]
*  Talk to us about the Utah Jazz. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2578.4s)]
*  Go. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2579.56s)]
*  No, don't get me started on this. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2580.4s)]
*  But every professional athlete, not every professional, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2581.2400000000002s)]
*  but most professional athletes had a summer job. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2583.36s)]
*  They didn't train year round like we did. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2586.2000000000003s)]
*  They literally were plumbers and firemen [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2587.84s)]
*  and welders and farmers. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2589.92s)]
*  Oh, I don't know. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2590.92s)]
*  So it was a matter of fact that he was playing against... [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2591.76s)]
*  But you also say that I think the implication [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2593.04s)]
*  is they're less athletic, they're less good. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2595.48s)]
*  Well, they were less good. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2597.6400000000003s)]
*  Let's be in the 1950s. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2598.48s)]
*  But that's just a matter of what they got paid, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2600.2400000000002s)]
*  they weren't like, hey, I wanna be a plumber [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2603.96s)]
*  and I'll play basketball on the side. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2606.28s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2608.2s)]
*  They're very good basketball players [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2609.04s)]
*  who had to make ends meet, as was Bob Cousy. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2609.88s)]
*  I can absolutely, I've been so consistent on this, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2612.24s)]
*  and yet people are like, you trash prior generations. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2615.84s)]
*  I've been consistent on this. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2618.76s)]
*  But Bob Cousy... [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2620.16s)]
*  The first time I ever commented on any of this [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2621.0s)]
*  was right after the top 75 list came out. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2623.0s)]
*  Yeah, and you were pissed [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2625.24s)]
*  that fucking Dwight Howard wasn't one. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2626.4s)]
*  And all I said was, we should absolutely celebrate [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2628.0s)]
*  the greatest players in every era, [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2632.2799999999997s)]
*  what they accomplished, who they were as players. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2633.96s)]
*  We should celebrate that. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2636.04s)]
*  But you can't tell me that, you know, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2637.7999999999997s)]
*  Dolph Shays was a better basketball player [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2640.7599999999998s)]
*  than Tracy McGrady or Kyrie Irving [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2643.0s)]
*  or Klay Thompson or Dwight Howard. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2644.88s)]
*  It's not based in any sort of fact. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2646.3599999999997s)]
*  Now, relative to the competition, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2649.2799999999997s)]
*  you can make an argument, right? [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2650.88s)]
*  Relative to the competition, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2652.48s)]
*  which is what I've been consistent on. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2653.6s)]
*  Celebrate what players were able to do in their era. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2654.88s)]
*  So I get knocked for, you know, I trashed Larry Bird. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2656.88s)]
*  Dominique Wilkins has been on like 19 different podcasts [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2659.72s)]
*  talking about how stupid I am [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2662.16s)]
*  for saying that Larry Bird is a top 10 player of all time [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2663.96s)]
*  and one of the greatest shooters ever. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2667.12s)]
*  But objectively, he's not a top five three-point shooter. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2669.48s)]
*  He's just not. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2672.04s)]
*  Well, wasn't there no... [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2672.8799999999997s)]
*  And the argument against that is, [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2673.72s)]
*  oh, well if he had played in today's era, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2674.64s)]
*  he would be a top five. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2677.3999999999996s)]
*  What? [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2678.52s)]
*  That doesn't even make sense. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2679.3599999999997s)]
*  That's not based in reality or fact. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2680.18s)]
*  Wait, wait, but was there a three-point line [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2681.6s)]
*  early in his career? [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2683.48s)]
*  Three-point line was 1979, 1980, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2684.68s)]
*  I believe was the first year of the three-point line. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2687.2s)]
*  Chris Ford made the first three-pointer ever. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2688.72s)]
*  But when does he come in the league? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2691.7599999999998s)]
*  Bird. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2693.48s)]
*  He was the class of 79, wasn't he? [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2694.68s)]
*  Okay, so right, so he's in it. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2696.3999999999996s)]
*  So the game is a little different, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2697.9199999999996s)]
*  but you're saying the data doesn't show [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2698.9199999999996s)]
*  that he's a top three-point shooter. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2700.6s)]
*  Yeah, he shot like three a game or something. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2702.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, 37% for his career. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2704.4399999999996s)]
*  Draymond Green just passed him in the all-time three-point list. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2706.8399999999997s)]
*  Total three-point, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2709.0s)]
*  I believe Richard Jefferson is right above him too. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2710.52s)]
*  I'm gonna say Richard Jefferson's one of the best three... [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2714.04s)]
*  I mean... [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2715.7599999999998s)]
*  So what was Larry Bird good at? [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2716.6s)]
*  Larry Bird was one of the greatest players ever. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2719.68s)]
*  He was a great shooter, first of all, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2722.8399999999997s)]
*  he was a great shooter. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2724.7599999999998s)]
*  Incredible passer. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2726.2s)]
*  Insane man. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2727.68s)]
*  He's also, to me, like when I watch, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2728.7999999999997s)]
*  because I watch full games, and then I watch, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2731.12s)]
*  of course I watch the highlight monitors that we all watch. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2733.8399999999997s)]
*  I love watching full games on YouTube. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2736.3199999999997s)]
*  It's one of the greatest gifts ever of YouTube. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2737.92s)]
*  But he's another guy who like defied a definition to me. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2740.72s)]
*  He defied a definition. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2746.48s)]
*  Jordan defied a definition. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2748.3199999999997s)]
*  He defied a definition. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2750.12s)]
*  They're transcendent players, transcendent. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2751.7999999999997s)]
*  That's how I look at him. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2755.04s)]
*  But not a good three-point shooter? [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2756.08s)]
*  No, he was a good three-point shooter. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2758.24s)]
*  But one of the best shooters ever? [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2761.16s)]
*  But Mad Dog that day said to me, [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2762.72s)]
*  but Larry Bird won a three-point contest. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2763.9599999999996s)]
*  I'm like, are you serious? [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2766.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2767.3199999999997s)]
*  There's been a lot of guys that have won three-point contests. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2768.72s)]
*  Did you ever win three-point contests? [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2770.04s)]
*  No, I fucking never made it past the first round. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2771.2s)]
*  Wait, why? [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2773.08s)]
*  Well, the first year I shot. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2774.88s)]
*  Ah. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2776.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2778.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2779.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2780.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2781.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2781.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2782.76s)]
*  Wait, it's because the rack is not on the right side. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2783.6s)]
*  If you have the rack on the right side. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2785.56s)]
*  What drives me crazy though is like, again, like. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2787.6s)]
*  You need people talking shit to you [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2791.36s)]
*  while you're shooting. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2792.6800000000003s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2793.52s)]
*  Perception and then there's like backs. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2794.36s)]
*  And you have like cameras in the arenas now. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2795.8s)]
*  You can track everything. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2799.4s)]
*  I can tell you that when Vinyama's release point [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2800.44s)]
*  is at 9.4 feet, I can tell you that LeBron James [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2803.4s)]
*  this year on Catch and Shoot 3s, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2806.36s)]
*  his right shoulder is turned six degrees more to the right. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2808.08s)]
*  So he's more square to the basket. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2810.88s)]
*  You would know Catch and Shoot 3s very well. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2812.0s)]
*  So. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2813.84s)]
*  So, my point is. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2814.6800000000003s)]
*  Are you a Catch and Shoot guy? [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2815.64s)]
*  I was for like, no, of course I was. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2816.8s)]
*  But I was also one of the top off the dribble jump shooters [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2820.52s)]
*  in the NBA for years. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2823.2000000000003s)]
*  I knew that about you. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2824.56s)]
*  Was one of the best mid-range shooters [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2825.4s)]
*  in the NBA for years. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2826.44s)]
*  It wasn't just like, when people say spot up, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2827.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm like, I didn't even practice spot up three. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2829.64s)]
*  Yeah, you didn't even practice it. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2831.84s)]
*  No, I didn't practice spot up three. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2832.96s)]
*  Why would I? [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2835.28s)]
*  Why would he? [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2836.12s)]
*  Why would he? [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2836.96s)]
*  He's putting it on the floor. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2837.8s)]
*  What am I getting at? [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2838.64s)]
*  He's putting it on the floor. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2839.48s)]
*  No, I'm moving. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2840.32s)]
*  I'm moving. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2841.16s)]
*  Also moving, dickhead. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2842.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2843.08s)]
*  Come on, bro. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2843.92s)]
*  Yeah, dude, you see how these Browns [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2844.76s)]
*  try to fucking take us down, man? [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2846.8s)]
*  It's fucked up, bro. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2848.6s)]
*  You don't have to take it. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2849.44s)]
*  I think this is what your senior thesis was about, actually. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2850.28s)]
*  Is you not being. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2852.7200000000003s)]
*  Yo, did you ever cross anybody up in the league? [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2853.64s)]
*  Is there anybody that you put on the floor? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2856.48s)]
*  On the floor? [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2858.84s)]

*  You crossed him up? [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2862.4s)]
*  Yeah, but I missed the shot, so it doesn't count. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2863.2400000000002s)]

*  No, Steph was off a jab step, though. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2867.52s)]
*  I mean. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2868.64s)]
*  That was like a. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2869.48s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2889.48s)]
*  I would always, especially on the left side, [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2890.32s)]
*  so I get to my right hand, [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2892.48s)]
*  when guys would close out that way, [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2893.32s)]
*  I would drive against the closeout. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2894.88s)]
*  I would drive against the closeout. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2897.56s)]
*  Wait a minute, do we have. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2898.6s)]

*  Wait, here we go. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2905.7200000000003s)]
*  Bye! [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2906.88s)]
*  Dropped him. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2907.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2908.56s)]
*  That one hurt me. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2909.4s)]

*  That one hurt. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2912.16s)]
*  It was not like a special move. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2913.0s)]
*  That was the most basic move ever. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2914.36s)]
*  Hold on, hold on. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2916.4s)]

*  I didn't fake. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2918.52s)]
*  I just drove away from his body. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2919.36s)]
*  Because he was terrified of you [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2922.5600000000004s)]
*  putting it on the floor, right? [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2923.7200000000003s)]
*  Let's watch that again, dude. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2924.96s)]

*  Because he read the scouting report, he's like. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=2928.2400000000002s)]

*  Some of y'all want to be chef extraordinaires. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3189.88s)]

*  you're watching Hell's Kitchen, you're watching Top Chef. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3193.92s)]
*  I don't know exactly what you're watching, [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3195.88s)]

*  How do we make sure that you don't mess it up? [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3224.4s)]
*  Just meet has got your back. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3226.88s)]
*  They're going to do all the difficult stuff. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3228.6s)]
*  All you need to do is just cook it. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3230.32s)]
*  They're going to have it marinated, absolutely delicious. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3232.2s)]
*  They're going to get the perfect cut of the meat. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3236.16s)]
*  They're going to have that meat that is perfectly cut [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3239.04s)]
*  and marinated for 24 hours. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3241.52s)]
*  They're going to deliver it to you. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3243.3199999999997s)]

*  and then rinse and repeat. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3252.8399999999997s)]
*  You clean up and then you repeat. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3255.6s)]
*  Season, cut, clean organic meat from a trusted farm. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3257.7599999999998s)]
*  That's all you need. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3261.16s)]
*  After that, you add the veggies, the rice, the quinoa, [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3262.96s)]
*  whatever the fuck you want to it, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3264.96s)]
*  and now your meal is done, okay? [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3266.88s)]
*  They took the most time-consuming part out of cooking [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3269.68s)]
*  and the most important part. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3273.12s)]
*  Let's just be honest, okay? [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3274.08s)]
*  Anybody can go grab the meat from the store, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3275.36s)]
*  but you can't create that flavor. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3277.84s)]
*  You can't make sure it's the right cut, [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3279.44s)]

*  I played against the Lakers in 2009, which was my third year. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3470.64s)]
*  I was still on my rookie contract. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3474.4s)]
*  In terms of the longevity, I stayed four years. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3476.64s)]
*  So I turned 22 right after the draft. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3480.4s)]
*  So I played the four years, I'm 26 in 2010, [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3483.16s)]
*  first time being a free agent, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3486.68s)]
*  and I really thought I was gonna get a five year deal [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3488.42s)]
*  from Boston for the full mid-level. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3490.7s)]
*  Were you guys talking? [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3492.32s)]
*  No, no, I did not think that. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3493.28s)]
*  But I played well against them [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3495.9599999999996s)]
*  two straight years in the playoffs. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3496.7999999999997s)]
*  So they're like, okay, we won this. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3497.7999999999997s)]
*  And then Perk gets hurt in game six [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3499.2799999999997s)]
*  of the finals against the Lakers. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3501.8799999999997s)]
*  So they used the mid-level on Jermaine O'Neal [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3503.8799999999997s)]
*  because Perk was gonna be out that season. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3505.7999999999997s)]
*  So I sat there for 10 days and I had to wait on LeBron. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3508.08s)]
*  So a bunch of guys signed, [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3511.3999999999996s)]
*  and then there was like a few teams [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3514.3199999999997s)]
*  that still had cap space that were waiting on LeBron. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3515.68s)]
*  Milwaukee. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3517.8799999999997s)]
*  Chicago was one of them. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3519.22s)]
*  So I signed with Chicago, but it was a three year deal. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3520.24s)]
*  And I remember thinking at the time, [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3522.68s)]
*  all right, 29, maybe I could re-up. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3524.7999999999997s)]
*  But the reason I wanted a five year deal, [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3527.24s)]
*  because I was thinking 31, I'm an undersized shooting guard [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3528.7599999999998s)]
*  with a negative wingspan. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3532.72s)]
*  I'm likely this is gonna be my last real contract. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3533.92s)]
*  So you're already looking at your mortality. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3537.4s)]
*  And then I made more money in my last four years [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3539.84s)]
*  than I did in my first 11 years. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3542.36s)]
*  Okay, so take us through that. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3543.72s)]
*  What is the, you're going from Orlando. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3545.0s)]
*  I thought you go Orlando and Milwaukee. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3547.92s)]
*  I was a restricted free agent. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3550.68s)]
*  So I'm on my honeymoon. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3552.06s)]
*  So I spent 10 days stressing out on my honeymoon. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3553.92s)]
*  I finally signed with Chicago. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3556.64s)]
*  I'm in Florence. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3558.2000000000003s)]
*  I signed with Chicago. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3559.56s)]
*  I've got to wait. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3561.12s)]
*  We then go to Barcelona and the entire, [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3563.2000000000003s)]
*  we didn't even like, we didn't do shit in Barcelona, [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3565.2400000000002s)]
*  but walk around and talk. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3567.88s)]
*  Because we were like, are we going to Chicago? [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3569.7200000000003s)]
*  We don't know anything about Chicago. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3571.6s)]
*  Should we move to Chicago? [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3572.6800000000003s)]
*  Should we live in Chicago? [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3573.52s)]
*  Should we have an off season home? [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3574.36s)]
*  Should we, like, what do we do? [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3575.2000000000003s)]
*  Like we need a home base. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3576.12s)]
*  Like it was just like this really uncertain period. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3577.08s)]
*  So I didn't really even enjoy Barcelona [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3581.7400000000002s)]
*  because I was like, I'm going to be honest with you. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3583.88s)]
*  And then the last day there, Orlando had seven days to match. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3584.7200000000003s)]
*  So on the seventh day they said, we're matching the contract. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3589.04s)]
*  You have to go back, right? [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3591.8s)]
*  So I then went back to Orlando. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3593.0s)]
*  The big thing for me was my last year in Orlando [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3595.1600000000003s)]
*  was our sort of our rebuild. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3598.6800000000003s)]
*  Dwight left, got traded to LA. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3600.12s)]
*  Stan was let go. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3602.2000000000003s)]
*  But you're hooping. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3603.96s)]
*  They bring in Jacques Vonn and Jacques came to me [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3604.8s)]
*  in pre-season and he's like, I don't want you to start [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3607.2000000000003s)]
*  because if you start, it's you, Aflalo and Jameer [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3611.12s)]
*  we're super undersized. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3613.7599999999998s)]
*  We're going to start more heartless. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3614.92s)]
*  So you're going to come off the bench [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3616.52s)]
*  but I want you to be my genobli. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3617.3399999999997s)]
*  I'm going to literally, it was the first time in my career [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3618.6s)]
*  was like, we're going to run plays through you. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3620.56s)]
*  When you're on the court, we're running offense through you. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3622.48s)]
*  So I play well and that was like, [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3625.16s)]
*  to me that was the turning point in my career. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3626.72s)]
*  So I signed with LA and the summer after my first year [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3628.68s)]
*  in LA, season ends, I'm 29. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3634.56s)]
*  I'm getting ready to turn 30. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3637.08s)]
*  I'm getting ready to have my first kid, [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3637.92s)]
*  Steve Nash live like two blocks from me. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3639.32s)]
*  So I keep running into him and I didn't really know Steve [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3641.6000000000004s)]
*  but he was always super kind to me. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3644.1600000000003s)]
*  And one day I ran into him and I was like, [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3645.6400000000003s)]
*  hey, can I have coffee with you? [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3647.56s)]
*  So we went and had coffee and I just said to him, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3649.96s)]
*  dude, you're one of the few guys at that point [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3653.2000000000003s)]
*  that had gotten better in their thirties. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3657.04s)]
*  He was an all star in Dallas. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3659.0800000000004s)]
*  Like it wasn't like he was a bad, [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3660.1200000000003s)]
*  but when he went to Phoenix, he got better in his thirties. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3661.36s)]
*  How did you do it? [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3664.44s)]
*  And he gave me some advice. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3665.28s)]
*  What did he say? [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3667.36s)]
*  Shorter and harder. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3669.36s)]
*  You don't need to shoot 800 shots. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3671.6800000000003s)]
*  I know what you're gonna say. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3673.44s)]
*  Can you not be a child? [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3676.36s)]
*  He cannot. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3679.6400000000003s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3680.48s)]
*  I didn't do anything. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3682.84s)]
*  Okay, I'll reword that for you. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3685.96s)]
*  The two white basketball players, [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3688.96s)]
*  what's the best thing? [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3690.56s)]
*  Short and hard. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3691.4s)]
*  Be more efficient in your training. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3693.92s)]
*  And I had always worked and I'd always worked in my game, [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3697.7200000000003s)]
*  but it wasn't about volume. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3700.0s)]
*  It was about every specific thing [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3701.2400000000002s)]
*  that you were going to do on a basketball court. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3702.92s)]
*  Do it at game speed and you don't need 20 reps, [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3704.88s)]
*  do 10 perfect reps. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3708.92s)]
*  So my workouts ended up being the same amount of time, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3710.52s)]
*  hour to an hour and 15 on the court every day, [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3713.08s)]
*  but they were more taxing. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3715.7200000000003s)]
*  Is that a better word for you? [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3719.36s)]
*  Yes. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3720.32s)]
*  They were more taxing. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3721.1600000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3721.98s)]
*  Wait, so you started working out- [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3722.82s)]
*  They really appealed to his Jewish side. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3723.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3724.48s)]
*  More taxing. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3725.32s)]
*  You started working out harder, [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3726.56s)]
*  or you had more taxing workouts, [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3729.0s)]
*  and you found that that benefited you more. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3730.52s)]
*  You weren't tired for the games. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3732.12s)]
*  You didn't feel like your body would be down more. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3733.52s)]
*  I ran on a track, [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3735.24s)]
*  or I would go run five miles at a specific speed [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3737.7999999999997s)]
*  to build a base level heart rate. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3741.0s)]
*  I did that throughout my 20s. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3743.2799999999997s)]
*  By the time I got to 30, 31, [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3745.58s)]
*  and all my off-season workouts, [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3749.08s)]
*  my basketball workout was so difficult [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3751.2799999999997s)]
*  that I didn't need to supplement it as much. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3754.68s)]
*  Now, two weeks before the training camp started, [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3756.52s)]
*  I would go find a turf field, or I'd go find a track, [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3758.64s)]
*  and I would do those cardio workouts. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3760.62s)]
*  But my basketball workouts were so difficult [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3763.2000000000003s)]
*  that by the end of it, I've lost five pounds in water weight. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3766.56s)]
*  I've built up my cardio. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3769.46s)]
*  And so being able to play and move at that speed [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3771.16s)]
*  all the time, that was essentially [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3774.32s)]
*  what created an advantage for me. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3776.2000000000003s)]
*  Okay, so you go to the Clippers. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3777.6s)]
*  You're already balling before you go to the Clippers, though. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3778.98s)]
*  You're already showing the league that you can score. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3780.86s)]
*  Yeah, Doc Rivers didn't save my career, [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3782.7200000000003s)]
*  but that's what you're asking me. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3784.08s)]
*  I wasn't gonna ask it, but it's funny. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3785.0s)]
*  Okay, good. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3786.7999999999997s)]
*  What's up with you and Pat Bev going at it? [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3788.16s)]
*  Our boy Pat Bev. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3789.96s)]
*  That's my guy, man. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3790.7999999999997s)]
*  Okay, good. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3791.64s)]
*  That's my guy, I don't know. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3792.46s)]
*  Okay, so you go there. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3793.2999999999997s)]
*  You're already hooping. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3794.88s)]
*  You go there. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3796.08s)]
*  Do they bring you there specifically for that? [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3797.38s)]
*  Is this just a good match? [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3800.0s)]
*  Do you get a conversation where they're like, [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3801.5s)]
*  hey, we see what you can do. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3803.04s)]
*  You're gonna get a lot of touches here and make it happen? [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3804.4s)]
*  Well, so I get traded at the end of my last year. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3806.6s)]
*  My contract is expiring. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3811.08s)]
*  They trade me for Tobias Harris, [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3812.68s)]
*  who was a young player at the time on Milwaukee, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3814.24s)]
*  who wasn't playing a lot. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3815.8799999999997s)]
*  So I go to Milwaukee. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3817.2799999999997s)]
*  We lose in the first round to the Miami Heat, [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3818.7999999999997s)]
*  and I thought I was gonna go back to Milwaukee. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3821.3999999999996s)]
*  And by the time it got like three, [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3823.3599999999997s)]
*  typically like the team, your incumbent team [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3825.8399999999997s)]
*  can have some contact with you right before free agency. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3828.2799999999997s)]
*  They can, you know, it's not like a full negotiation, [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3830.7999999999997s)]
*  but they'll like, they'll check in with you or whatever. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3833.7s)]
*  So it's like crickets for like two months. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3836.24s)]
*  And I'm like, okay, Milwaukee's not gonna happen. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3837.7599999999998s)]
*  So my agent calls me in, [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3840.96s)]
*  I was on vacation for my birthday and anniversary. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3844.92s)]
*  I'm in Napa. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3847.0s)]
*  My agent calls me and he's like, [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3848.36s)]
*  can you be in LA in two days? [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3849.2s)]
*  The T-wolves in the Pistons wanna meet with you. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3853.28s)]
*  So I'm like, okay. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3856.04s)]
*  So I'm gonna meet with Flip. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3856.92s)]
*  I'm gonna meet with Joe Dumars. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3858.04s)]
*  So we decided to rent a car. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3859.8s)]
*  We rented, and all they had at the time [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3861.6s)]
*  was like this two-door Nissan. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3863.26s)]
*  It was great. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3864.56s)]
*  Drove, literally it was my first time doing that drive. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3866.2400000000002s)]
*  All the way from Napa, all the way to LA. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3868.88s)]
*  We made stops in Big Sur. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3870.44s)]
*  We made stops in Santa Barbara. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3871.6s)]
*  It was awesome. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3872.8s)]
*  Get to LA, I meet with Flip. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3873.92s)]
*  I meet with Joe. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3875.7200000000003s)]
*  Flip offers a contract. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3876.96s)]
*  And on our way down there, Chris Rivers, [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3879.32s)]
*  Doc's wife at the time, had texted Chelsea [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3883.44s)]
*  because Chelsea had taught her in Pilates. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3885.8s)]
*  She said, can JJ have Doc's number? [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3888.04s)]
*  So Doc reaches out that night when free agency starts. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3889.8s)]
*  Can you have dinner tomorrow? [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3892.8s)]
*  So I've now met with the Pistons and the Wolves. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3894.08s)]
*  I go have dinner with Doc. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3895.7200000000003s)]
*  And at that dinner, he said, [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3896.64s)]
*  he said, I think you've been used wrong. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3898.44s)]
*  I want to use you like Ray Allen. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3901.8s)]
*  Now I don't know if that was a recruiting pitch [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3903.68s)]
*  because I had talked a lot and Ray knows this. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3905.44s)]
*  So I just had him on my podcast. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3908.7200000000003s)]
*  Ray knows this. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3910.04s)]
*  Like Ray was the guy I wanted to be. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3910.88s)]
*  I wanted to be Ray Allen. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3913.16s)]
*  I didn't want to be a white shooter. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3914.48s)]
*  I wanted to be Ray. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3916.08s)]
*  Early Ray or late Ray? [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3920.2000000000003s)]
*  Early Ray. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3922.32s)]
*  JJ? [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3923.32s)]
*  Early Ray. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3924.16s)]
*  JJ. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3925.0s)]
*  I know. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3925.84s)]
*  He was dunking on people. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3927.36s)]
*  I know. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3928.36s)]
*  I'll never forget in high school [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3929.32s)]
*  that when they would do the rankings [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3930.8s)]
*  and they would give comps for players. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3933.56s)]
*  Like my comp was always a catch and shoot guy. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3936.04s)]
*  One time, I got Ray Allen as my comp. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3939.8s)]
*  And it was like a dream come true. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3943.2000000000003s)]
*  I was like, I made it. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3945.1600000000003s)]
*  Ray is my comp. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3946.8s)]
*  Anyway, so when I went to LA, [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3948.32s)]
*  I got all the Boston stuff that Doc ran for Ray. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3950.48s)]
*  I got all that shit. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3953.48s)]
*  It was great. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3955.7200000000003s)]
*  He was forthcoming with this. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3956.92s)]
*  He was like, listen, we really want you to cook. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3958.32s)]
*  Go out there, shoot. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3960.36s)]
*  I didn't even know I was gonna start. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3961.2s)]
*  Like that's the thing. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3962.4s)]
*  Like I remember first day of training camp, [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3963.24s)]
*  we went to San Diego that year [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3966.48s)]
*  and Jamal Crawford was still there, right? [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3969.2799999999997s)]
*  And Willie Green had started the year before. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3972.72s)]
*  They'd used Jamal as like a bench player [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3974.7999999999997s)]
*  or not a six man, whatever. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3977.08s)]
*  And I remember having a conversation with Jamal. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3978.44s)]
*  I was like, do you know who's gonna start? [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3980.6s)]
*  He's like, no, I don't know. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3981.68s)]
*  You asked Jamal. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3982.52s)]
*  Yeah, so then I go to T. Lou, [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3983.44s)]
*  who was our assistant at the time. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3985.16s)]
*  I go to T. Lou and I'm like, [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3987.48s)]
*  I was like, who's starting? [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3988.32s)]
*  Who's starting? [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3989.84s)]
*  I wanna have some head space [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3990.68s)]
*  as I go into my first practice with the Clippers. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3992.32s)]
*  And he looked at me and he goes, you motherfucker. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3994.68s)]
*  No. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3997.0s)]
*  Like that and I was like, okay. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3997.84s)]
*  So that was like a big, I mean, I did that and I started. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=3998.88s)]
*  Was there an ego issue with Jamal? [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4001.36s)]
*  No, with Fam? [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4003.08s)]
*  No. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4004.56s)]
*  He's the man. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4005.4s)]
*  No, him and I are, yeah. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4006.22s)]
*  Also, I love him coming off the bench. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4008.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I think he knew. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4009.64s)]
*  Just give him the ball. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4011.12s)]
*  I'm on my head cooked. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4012.28s)]
*  Great, because Doc also liked having all bench, [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4013.12s)]

*  so Jamal gets to be the ISO guy. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4049.98s)]
*  And he like scored on me once, [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4052.32s)]
*  and I like, Jamal carried the ball, let's be honest. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4053.88s)]

*  Yeah, who would pass you the ball? [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4072.48s)]

*  No. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4090.28s)]
*  He can't hold. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4091.12s)]
*  Jamal and I never once had a rivalry. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4092.4s)]
*  Really? [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4094.44s)]
*  No, from day one. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4095.28s)]
*  He was like the greatest teammate. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4096.52s)]
*  He's the man. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4098.0s)]
*  He's the man. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4098.82s)]
*  I've heard he's like, he takes incredible care [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4099.66s)]
*  of his body, greatest teammate, super smart guy. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4100.88s)]
*  Doesn't smoke, doesn't drink. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4102.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4104.08s)]
*  Yeah, gets to sleep. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4104.92s)]
*  Handles ridiculous. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4105.84s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4107.4800000000005s)]
*  Never done a ball handling drill in his life. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4108.32s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4110.56s)]
*  That's what he claims. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4111.400000000001s)]
*  So a guy like that, what does he just have? [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4112.76s)]
*  Like incredibly fast wrists or whatever that is? [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4114.6s)]
*  Or it's just super long arms? [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4117.04s)]
*  He can get to the ball. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4118.68s)]
*  So he's got it on his string. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4120.24s)]
*  I think that's part of it with Kyrie too. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4123.0s)]
*  I don't know his wingspan relative to his body. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4125.16s)]
*  Everybody's shaped different. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4128.24s)]
*  I remember De'Andre Jordan, I'm like, [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4129.2s)]
*  dude, you have no torso. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4131.12s)]
*  He's just all legs. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4132.88s)]
*  No torso, he's all legs. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4134.099999999999s)]
*  Vince Carter and I, Vince is like 6'6", I'm like 6'4". [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4136.179999999999s)]
*  So if Vince Carter and I sat next to each other like this, [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4139.099999999999s)]
*  I'm like two inches taller than him. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4142.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh, he's all legs too. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4143.48s)]
*  He's all arms and legs. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4144.48s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4145.4s)]
*  And I don't know, I feel like Kyrie, [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4146.24s)]
*  maybe, I don't know his wingspan, [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4148.28s)]
*  but I feel like Kyrie's like, anatomically, [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4149.54s)]
*  is just like built so that he can handle the ball. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4152.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4154.5599999999995s)]
*  He's obviously worked at it too. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4155.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4156.76s)]
*  And just unbelievable touch, like finishing ability. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4157.64s)]
*  What is that? [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4160.6s)]
*  What do you think that would be? [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4161.4400000000005s)]
*  Touch. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4162.320000000001s)]
*  To describe it, like technically? [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4163.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4165.46s)]
*  Oh, here's a better question. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4166.3s)]
*  Did you think you had good touch? [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4167.280000000001s)]
*  Prolific shooter, but did you think you had [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4169.76s)]
*  good touch around the rim? [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4171.6s)]
*  The few years where my float game was pretty good. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4173.72s)]
*  Okay. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4176.08s)]
*  My finishing numbers were pretty good, [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4177.160000000001s)]
*  like prime of my career. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4178.76s)]
*  I had a shoulder issue in summer of 2016. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4181.14s)]
*  It was right after the season. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4185.96s)]
*  I led the league in three points shooting that year. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4187.44s)]
*  I used to do the walk away. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4189.48s)]
*  You know the Steph walk away where you shoot? [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4190.48s)]
*  Like that year I had a few of those where like I'd shoot [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4192.2s)]
*  and I'd turn and run up court. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4194.36s)]
*  It felt good. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4195.599999999999s)]
*  I'm not gonna lie, it felt pretty good. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4196.44s)]
*  But we go to, my wife and I went to Santa Barbara [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4198.76s)]
*  after the season. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4200.96s)]
*  And I've got a soon to be one year old [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4202.36s)]
*  and I'm throwing him in the pool. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4204.76s)]
*  And I like fucked my shoulder up. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4206.88s)]
*  I got an MRI, like there was nothing like- [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4208.24s)]
*  Structurally wrong. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4209.88s)]
*  Structurally wrong with it. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4210.72s)]
*  The rest of my career, my shoulder was fucked up. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4211.5599999999995s)]
*  So you know how Markov faults when he shoots, [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4213.92s)]
*  his shoulder goes like this? [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4215.52s)]
*  So the rest of my career I did that. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4216.76s)]
*  It really actually affected me the most [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4218.64s)]
*  on floaters and layups. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4221.24s)]
*  Like even I coach my kids and I'll be demonstrating a drill [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4223.04s)]
*  and like sometimes I'll go shoot [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4225.96s)]
*  an uncontested right handed layup and I'll miss it [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4227.4800000000005s)]
*  because my shoulder just like, [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4229.6s)]
*  I can't activate my scapula correctly. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4230.6s)]
*  I have a bad scapula movement. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4233.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4234.64s)]
*  Same exact thing. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4235.4800000000005s)]
*  And you make up for it by just moving your entire shoulder. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4236.3s)]
*  Convincing. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4238.6s)]
*  Yeah, instead of doing this rotation. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4239.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4241.08s)]
*  I used to when I would shoot free throws [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4241.92s)]
*  at the end of my career. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4243.32s)]
*  So normally I would just shoot free throws like this, right? [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4244.44s)]
*  But at the end of my career I had to put the ball out. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4246.32s)]
*  And keep your shoulder down. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4249.48s)]
*  Activate my, otherwise this thing would come up [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4251.12s)]
*  and I'd be shooting like this. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4253.4s)]
*  Okay, so what happens with the three point shooting then? [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4254.48s)]
*  I compensated. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4256.719999999999s)]
*  How? [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4257.599999999999s)]
*  I'd sometimes shoot like that [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4258.42s)]
*  and then I'd just compensate for the angle of my shot. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4259.639999999999s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4262.139999999999s)]
*  Well again, I wasn't a catch and shoot guy. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4263.799999999999s)]
*  Spot up. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4266.04s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4266.88s)]
*  But on the move, on the move. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4267.719999999999s)]
*  I'm not convinced. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4268.5599999999995s)]
*  You're not actually shooting at a moving target, [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4269.4s)]
*  but you are. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4272.22s)]
*  So like if you're coming off a pin, [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4273.46s)]
*  or like I remember there's one shot I made. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4274.84s)]
*  You can pull it up if you want. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4276.46s)]
*  There's one? [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4277.9400000000005s)]
*  There's one? [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4278.780000000001s)]
*  I'll go on the text. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4279.62s)]
*  I'll go on the text. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4282.46s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4283.58s)]
*  There was what? [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4284.58s)]
*  There was another text. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4285.42s)]
*  White boy. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4286.900000000001s)]
*  I'll find it. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4287.740000000001s)]
*  I'll check it. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4288.58s)]
*  Check it. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4289.42s)]
*  No. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4290.26s)]
*  I can't go. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4291.08s)]
*  There was one shot I made. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4291.92s)]
*  We were playing, it was LeBron's first year in LA. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4292.76s)]
*  So it was my second year in Philly. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4295.900000000001s)]
*  We were playing LeBron on like a Sunday ABC game. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4297.52s)]
*  Ben gets a long rebound. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4300.26s)]
*  I'm over in the right corner in front of their bench, [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4301.38s)]
*  and I'm on a dead sprint to the right corner. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4303.06s)]
*  Ben's doing his little thing, and he throws it to me. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4305.46s)]
*  And I'm on a dead sprint, [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4309.14s)]
*  and I look down to make sure I'm inbounds. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4310.46s)]
*  I catch the ball, kind of turn all in one motion, [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4312.860000000001s)]
*  and I shoot it behind the backboard. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4316.32s)]
*  And the shot did not feel good, [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4318.62s)]
*  because my shoulder did the thing. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4320.860000000001s)]
*  It wasn't like, I would occasionally get to shoot [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4322.62s)]
*  a pure shot where like my shoulder didn't do it, [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4324.860000000001s)]
*  but my shoulder did the thing. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4326.860000000001s)]
*  So I'm like behind the backboard, Reggie Bullock fouled me. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4327.9400000000005s)]
*  It was a four point play. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4330.7s)]
*  He's in my lap. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4331.66s)]
*  And so I'm like literally like, all right, [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4333.099999999999s)]
*  I've got to, you know, in the split second, [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4334.74s)]
*  I got to shoot it and point at that moving target. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4336.38s)]
*  And the ball went in, and I turn to TJ McConnell, [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4340.0599999999995s)]
*  and I go, that was tough. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4342.58s)]
*  And I still think to this day, [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4346.5s)]
*  that was the greatest shot I ever made in my life. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4347.9s)]
*  Okay, what would we put in to get this shot? [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4349.74s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4352.139999999999s)]
*  Who were you playing? [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4352.98s)]
*  Lakers. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4353.98s)]
*  JJ Reddick four point play, Lakers maybe? [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4354.82s)]
*  I had 21 points that game. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4356.62s)]
*  Wait, I still don't understand what you're doing [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4361.38s)]
*  to compensate for the shot. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4363.0199999999995s)]
*  So shoulder goes up. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4363.94s)]
*  If it happened, my point is, if it happened, which it did, [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4365.7s)]
*  no, that's a different one. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4371.0199999999995s)]
*  That's, you know, that's just a normal four point play. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4371.86s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4374.78s)]
*  No. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4375.62s)]
*  Wait, here's the question. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4377.46s)]
*  What? [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4378.82s)]
*  I see why they hate you. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4379.66s)]
*  I see why they hate you. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4381.5s)]
*  She was justified. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4382.94s)]
*  I thought it was wrong until right now. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4383.98s)]
*  Yo, actually since while we're pulling this up, [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4385.74s)]
*  basketball players have crazy, [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4388.5s)]
*  is that all basketball players that have recall like that? [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4389.94s)]
*  I've always heard the body of any play [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4392.54s)]
*  from any time in his career. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4394.379999999999s)]
*  Let's say about Bill Russell too. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4395.54s)]
*  Bill Russell. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4397.0199999999995s)]
*  A lot of players do, a lot of players do. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4398.339999999999s)]
*  What do you attribute that to? [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4401.58s)]
*  So someone. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4402.419999999999s)]
*  Can you do this with stories your wife tells you? [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4404.46s)]
*  When I first, I remember a lot of shit. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4406.66s)]
*  Really? [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4408.9s)]
*  Yeah, I remember a lot of shit. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4409.74s)]
*  Yeah, that's it right here. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4410.66s)]
*  Let's go, let's go. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4411.5s)]
*  Is it right here? [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4412.78s)]
*  Simmons passed it to you. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4413.9s)]
*  Bang, great shot. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4416.7s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4417.7s)]
*  Wait a minute, hold on. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4418.54s)]
*  I don't see your shoulder coming up. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4419.42s)]
*  Go back, go back, go back. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4420.66s)]
*  If you, I. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4422.9800000000005s)]
*  I think you have to zoom in. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4423.82s)]
*  Oh, look right there, it's up. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4425.42s)]
*  It's up. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4426.7s)]
*  Oh, you're saying you're up here [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4427.54s)]
*  before you've been bringing your arm up. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4428.9400000000005s)]
*  Yep, yep. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4430.78s)]
*  And then. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4432.02s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4432.86s)]
*  I'm curious, was the team aware of this injury? [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4433.7s)]
*  Oh, I agree. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4435.62s)]
*  Oh wow, it is, look at it. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4436.62s)]
*  Activation, I do it all the time. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4437.46s)]
*  No, I see it, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4438.66s)]
*  Look at it, look at it, look at it. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4440.62s)]
*  Yeah, you can see the slant. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4441.46s)]
*  That's not how you should shoot a basketball. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4442.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4444.9400000000005s)]
*  But like did you hide it because. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4445.900000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't hide it because I shot 43% from three. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4447.5s)]
*  So it works. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4450.1s)]
*  So it helps you. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4451.78s)]
*  It's kind of a rookie of the year situation. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4452.74s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of a. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4454.54s)]
*  Yeah, the injuries are better. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4456.02s)]
*  Rookie of the year, bro, this is brilliant. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4458.06s)]
*  So, and why didn't you try to do more catch and shoots [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4459.38s)]
*  because that was actually really good. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4461.86s)]
*  Like. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4463.26s)]
*  No. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4464.1s)]
*  It seems like you're really good at it. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4464.94s)]
*  No, I did a lot of catch and shoots. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4466.26s)]
*  I was a good catch and shoot player, [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4467.82s)]
*  and it's fine to say that. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4469.22s)]
*  Yeah, I mean. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4470.46s)]
*  The way you said it though. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4471.3s)]
*  I know, I know. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4472.54s)]
*  Spot on, spot on. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4473.38s)]
*  It's like he called you a hunky. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4474.78s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4476.22s)]
*  I was gonna say the recall thing. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4478.18s)]
*  So when I first started calling games. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4479.38s)]
*  Like when you recall and I call you a hunky. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4480.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4482.26s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4483.1s)]
*  When I first started calling games, [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4483.9400000000005s)]
*  I remember I had a Warriors game [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4485.740000000001s)]
*  and we were in the green room [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4487.58s)]
*  and we were talking about my recall. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4489.3s)]
*  So Raymond, who's their head of PR, [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4492.26s)]
*  and Steve Kerwalk in, and whoever, [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4494.780000000001s)]
*  I think it was Ryan Ruko, but he was like, [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4498.18s)]
*  hey, Steve, do you have recall? [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4499.38s)]
*  He's like, oh yeah, I have recall. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4500.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm getting older now, blah, blah, blah. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4502.1s)]
*  He's like, apparently JJ has crazy recall. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4503.62s)]
*  So Raymond's in the room. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4505.5s)]
*  I've called 12 Warriors games since then. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4507.7s)]
*  Every single time he has a question for me [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4509.82s)]
*  about a specific game. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4511.82s)]
*  So I'm like 11 for 11. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4513.34s)]
*  Wow. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4515.1s)]
*  And he comes to me on Saturday night [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4515.94s)]
*  and he's like, what's the biggest lead [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4517.66s)]
*  your team has ever lost and to lose a game? [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4521.38s)]
*  And I was like, I think it was the lockout year. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4525.7s)]
*  And he's like, do you remember who, [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4528.7s)]
*  anything about it, the opponent, the thing? [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4530.74s)]
*  And I said, I can't. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4532.42s)]
*  And it was the first time I didn't get to him. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4533.54s)]
*  But then once he said the game, I was like, I remember. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4535.26s)]
*  Were you right about lockout year? [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4536.9800000000005s)]
*  It was a lockout year. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4538.22s)]
*  The Boston Celtics, each one more came off the bench, [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4539.22s)]
*  had five threes, Avery Bradley, just complete. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4541.3s)]
*  We were up like 24 and we lost. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4543.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I remember the game. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4545.62s)]
*  So what do you attribute that to? [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4546.780000000001s)]
*  Because it seems like a thing a lot of, [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4548.42s)]
*  maybe pro athletes, but NBA in particular, have. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4550.5s)]
*  Is that something that helps you as a pro? [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4553.26s)]
*  I just don't know where it comes from. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4555.18s)]
*  If I could turn my brain off, I would. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4558.42s)]
*  It's not necessarily like, [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4562.62s)]
*  it's not a good thing. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4565.02s)]
*  It's not a good thing. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4566.02s)]
*  I was in the green room today at first take [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4567.02s)]
*  in Kimberly Martin, who does NFL. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4568.620000000001s)]
*  I didn't even know I was doing it. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4570.780000000001s)]
*  And she was like, what is going on in your brain? [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4572.06s)]
*  What is that face you're making, [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4575.46s)]
*  what is going on in your brain? [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4577.38s)]
*  You were staring at her feet. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4578.22s)]
*  No, I was literally looking out the window. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4579.06s)]
*  I was looking at the fucking East River like this. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4581.620000000001s)]
*  And she's like, what's going on in your brain? [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4585.38s)]
*  And I had had one of my friends that still plays in the NBA [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4587.540000000001s)]
*  and said, I wanna come stay with you this summer [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4591.06s)]
*  and work on some catch and shoot stuff. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4593.26s)]
*  And I was literally going through the drills. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4595.18s)]
*  Wait, what kind of stuff? [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4597.46s)]
*  What did he wanna work with you this summer? [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4599.58s)]
*  Like movement shooting, movement shooting. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4601.38s)]
*  Not a lot of shooting. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4603.02s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4603.860000000001s)]
*  You can do that on your own. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4604.7s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4605.54s)]
*  I want you to know, I was kidding. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4606.38s)]
*  I was trying to jab you. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4608.18s)]
*  But you hit a nerve. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4609.02s)]
*  Confirming that my brain is just like this. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4610.22s)]
*  So like, it's a good thing, but then it's like, [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4612.46s)]
*  you're constantly being reminded of every, like, [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4616.740000000001s)]
*  I'll have shit, and I'll like, literally some days, [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4619.7s)]
*  I'll be like, man, that one shot. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4621.94s)]
*  No. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4623.78s)]
*  Game five against the Boston Celtics in 2018. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4624.62s)]
*  If I make that shot, we'd probably win game five. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4627.419999999999s)]
*  We'd go back to Philly. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4629.58s)]
*  Maybe we force a game seven. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4630.419999999999s)]
*  Like, that's how my brain. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4631.62s)]
*  How open were you? [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4632.46s)]
*  What? [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4633.299999999999s)]
*  How open were you? [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4634.139999999999s)]
*  I was wide open. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4634.98s)]
*  Yeah, TJ McConnell drove baseline. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4636.099999999999s)]
*  I was on the left wing. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4637.54s)]
*  They helped on him. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4639.419999999999s)]
*  We had a cut. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4640.5s)]
*  Maybe, side's been on the pass in defense, but. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4642.299999999999s)]
*  And my shoulder did the thing. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4645.299999999999s)]
*  And my shoulder did the thing. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4648.58s)]
*  No it didn't. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4649.419999999999s)]
*  And I was short. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4650.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4651.1s)]
*  But do you overthink sometimes? [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4652.3s)]
*  Like, because you're always on, constantly like, [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4653.620000000001s)]
*  calculating, does that ever happen in game? [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4655.700000000001s)]
*  This is. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4657.34s)]
*  Occasionally, but no. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4661.06s)]
*  I don't. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4662.54s)]
*  Occasionally. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4663.660000000001s)]
*  Want to compare, but there's a similar comic thing. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4664.5s)]
*  It's too fast. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4666.34s)]
*  That's the thing I love. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4667.42s)]
*  It happens on the golf course. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4668.42s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4669.860000000001s)]
*  It happens on the golf course, for sure. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4670.700000000001s)]
*  It's all things. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4671.660000000001s)]
*  It's a static sport. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4672.5s)]
*  Basketball's freedom. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4673.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4674.160000000001s)]
*  It's dynamic. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4675.0s)]
*  No, it's freedom from your brain. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4675.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4676.660000000001s)]
*  You need to be present every single second of the day. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4677.5s)]
*  Because you're slow in white. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4680.179999999999s)]
*  So, you know what I mean? [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4682.139999999999s)]
*  Like in high school you could check out, [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4686.179999999999s)]
*  you could think about all these different things, but. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4687.7s)]
*  No, no, but. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4689.5s)]
*  Remember Coach Collins, Chris Collins, [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4691.78s)]
*  came to a high school game, like, in your year. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4693.139999999999s)]
*  I committed to Duke at this point. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4694.62s)]
*  Came to a game, and I had 28 points, 12 rebounds. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4696.22s)]
*  Recall, dude. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4700.179999999999s)]
*  And he called me after the game, we played Salem. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4701.0199999999995s)]
*  And he called me after the game, and he's like, [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4702.9s)]
*  he's like, bro, I was so disappointed [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4705.94s)]
*  in your performance tonight. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4707.62s)]
*  There were so many possessions that you took off. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4708.94s)]
*  So your point, yeah, in high school it was, [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4711.179999999999s)]
*  I could go get 28 and 12 and just be like. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4713.299999999999s)]
*  But the league is perfect for you. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4714.5s)]
*  Because for, what is it, an hour a night, [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4716.379999999999s)]
*  two hours a night, your brain actually shuts off. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4718.339999999999s)]
*  I think people feel that way about like surfing, [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4722.379999999999s)]
*  definitely paddle, boxing. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4724.54s)]
*  As a comic, crowd work. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4726.62s)]
*  I have a similar, my brain doesn't shut off. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4728.379999999999s)]
*  It's not always a good thing. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4730.0599999999995s)]
*  I can't sleep a lot, my brain is just going. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4730.9s)]
*  But part of the reason I think I'm good at crowd work [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4732.82s)]
*  is my brain just gets to listen and react. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4736.5s)]
*  And I don't have any time to overthink anything. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4739.78s)]
*  What do you say, what's a clever response, that's it. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4740.9s)]
*  First take is like that for me. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4743.74s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4745.099999999999s)]
*  Gotta stay in the moment, it's live. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4745.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's live, you're just in the moment. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4747.099999999999s)]
*  Calling games is like that too. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4750.0599999999995s)]
*  Calling games for sure. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4751.82s)]
*  Calling games is the hardest thing. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4752.66s)]
*  It's the hardest thing. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4754.179999999999s)]
*  It's the hardest, why? [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4755.0199999999995s)]
*  It's because, like, even first take, [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4756.0599999999995s)]
*  you have the topics ahead of time. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4758.299999999999s)]
*  You can prepare. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4762.34s)]
*  I learned my first year, I was like, [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4763.179999999999s)]
*  I gotta be on every production call. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4764.179999999999s)]
*  So every time I'm on first take, [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4765.58s)]
*  I get on the production call at 7.30 in the morning, [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4767.3s)]
*  do the production call, then take my kids to school, [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4769.3s)]
*  come back home, get ready, go. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4770.900000000001s)]
*  So I know ahead of time exactly what we're gonna talk about. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4773.62s)]
*  Now sometimes, Mad Dog may say something, [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4776.7s)]
*  Stephen A may say something that you react to in real time, [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4779.5s)]
*  but you're prepared. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4782.1s)]
*  A game, I don't know what's gonna happen in a game. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4784.7s)]
*  And I've gotta talk about it in a way [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4788.14s)]
*  that's not repetitive or redundant. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4789.7s)]
*  It's not like, okay, I know Jokic is gonna get post-ups. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4792.18s)]
*  I can't just keep saying he's posting up. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4795.26s)]
*  So you have to think on the fly all the time [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4797.62s)]
*  about what's happening and how you wanna say it. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4801.1s)]
*  Plus, I've worked a lot of three-person booths. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4803.9400000000005s)]
*  So last year, this year, I worked a lot with RJ. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4806.66s)]
*  Now I'm working with Doris and Mike. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4809.860000000001s)]
*  And that is a challenge. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4811.66s)]
*  It's more of a challenge? [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4813.860000000001s)]
*  Versus a two-person booth. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4815.1s)]
*  Really? [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4815.9400000000005s)]
*  Because probably there's less time to talk. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4816.780000000001s)]
*  You have to do everything quicker. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4817.740000000001s)]
*  Like, explaining things that could take, [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4818.66s)]
*  you have unlimited time here. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4820.22s)]
*  The game is so fast now, too. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4821.5s)]
*  Like, it's not the NFL. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4823.58s)]
*  It's not baseball. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4824.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4825.62s)]
*  Where there's 15 seconds between a pitch [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4826.46s)]
*  or an NFL where you have two different replays [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4828.66s)]
*  after every single play. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4830.78s)]
*  Real quick, what are they saying [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4832.099999999999s)]
*  your responsibility is in the booth? [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4833.42s)]
*  To celebrate the game. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4836.62s)]
*  It's about the game. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4838.259999999999s)]
*  So, but they're not saying that you have to do play-by-play. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4839.099999999999s)]
*  That's Mike Breen, All-Famer. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4842.98s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4844.0599999999995s)]
*  So they're basically, you're doing color commentary. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4844.9s)]
*  Color commentary, exactly. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4847.46s)]
*  So what does that exactly mean? [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4849.62s)]
*  Are you describing what that player is feeling [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4852.58s)]
*  in the moment? [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4855.14s)]
*  What play they should do? [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4855.98s)]
*  Why they did that play? [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4856.8s)]
*  Hopefully it's a mix of technical and conversation. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4858.46s)]
*  Got it. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4863.22s)]
*  You know, particularly in like a three-person booth, [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4864.7s)]
*  you wanna have like chemistry with the people. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4867.46s)]
*  Yeah, when there's camaraderie, it's awesome. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4870.38s)]
*  For sure. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4871.9s)]
*  So then the other responsibility a lot of times is timeouts. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4873.86s)]
*  Going to timeout, they typically, [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4877.82s)]
*  you get one or two replays. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4879.7s)]
*  And then something called podbusters, [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4882.179999999999s)]
*  which are essentially within a quarter [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4885.099999999999s)]
*  or at the end of a quarter, [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4887.9s)]
*  they may show like a two or three play highlight package [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4888.9s)]
*  of LeBron scoring in transition or whatever it may be. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4891.82s)]
*  Poor Zing is spotting up from three, right? [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4895.46s)]
*  And you have to sort of cover that. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4897.54s)]
*  But the play-by-play, I mean, that's like a skill [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4899.78s)]
*  that you have to go to school for, practice. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4903.66s)]
*  It's like, I didn't practice to be a color analyst. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4906.179999999999s)]
*  No, no, totally. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4908.3s)]
*  I'm just wondering what they say your responsibility is. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4909.139999999999s)]
*  What do the producers, when they hire you for it, [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4911.22s)]
*  say that you have to bring to the broadcast? [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4913.06s)]
*  My insight to basketball. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4917.42s)]
*  Got it. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4919.26s)]
*  Yeah. Got it. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4920.1s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4920.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I remember my boss said to me, [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4921.780000000001s)]
*  he was like, as much as you can share, share. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4924.02s)]
*  But you have to do it in a way, [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4927.780000000001s)]
*  something called laying out. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4930.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4931.38s)]
*  You have to be able to lay out too, [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4932.22s)]
*  which means laying out means you shut the fuck up. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4933.780000000001s)]
*  So like Tony Romo at the end of the Super Bowl [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4935.900000000001s)]
*  didn't lay out. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4937.9800000000005s)]
*  He didn't let Jim Nance set the stage, right? [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4939.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4941.620000000001s)]
*  Apparently, I heard a few people talking about this. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4942.46s)]
*  It's a game-winning play in the Super Bowl. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4944.54s)]
*  The announcer makes one line, [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4946.34s)]
*  and then you just let the crowd speak. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4947.58s)]
*  Yes. The noise. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4948.820000000001s)]
*  This is, and Tony Romo started talking. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4949.660000000001s)]
*  Even after a big moment. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4951.34s)]
*  So that was the one piece of advice I got. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4952.34s)]
*  So I never called a game. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4954.740000000001s)]
*  I begged my first year at ESPN, [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4956.620000000001s)]
*  I was like, can I please call a game? [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4958.820000000001s)]
*  Can I please call a game? [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4959.660000000001s)]
*  So they were like, fine, you can call Philly, New York. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4960.5s)]
*  And I think it was New York, Miami or Philly, Miami. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4963.58s)]
*  So my first two games were regular season games in March. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4966.94s)]
*  And the only piece of advice they said was like, [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4969.38s)]
*  you just gotta lay out sometimes. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4971.58s)]
*  Don't over talk. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4973.259999999999s)]
*  Joel Embiid texted me after the first game. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4974.62s)]
*  He's like, dude, you didn't speak in the first quarter. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4976.139999999999s)]
*  I'm curious, if one of my favorite young up and coming [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4978.299999999999s)]
*  players makes it to the league, [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=4982.46s)]

*  We're not going to see that name in any of your poems. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5011.259999999999s)]
*  OK. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5017.82s)]
*  Have you ever had a player get mad for your commentary. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5022.54s)]
*  Yeah, these are your friends. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5024.82s)]
*  Your contemporaries. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5026.7s)]

*  and they're like, no, that's not what happened. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5031.22s)]
*  I did it differently. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5032.5199999999995s)]
*  You didn't see it properly. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5033.36s)]
*  Not on a game, on some commentary, yeah. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5035.94s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5039.139999999999s)]
*  And how do you handle that? [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5039.98s)]
*  I just talk to them like we're friends. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5041.26s)]
*  And then they understand? [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5043.94s)]
*  Well, also I try to understand them. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5045.099999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5047.099999999999s)]
*  I try to understand them. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5048.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's happened. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5049.26s)]
*  It's happened a few times. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5050.099999999999s)]
*  I can think of two off the top of my head. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5050.94s)]
*  For example, can you share? [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5052.82s)]
*  No. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5053.98s)]
*  Private stuff. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5054.82s)]
*  Gotcha. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5055.74s)]
*  No. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5056.58s)]
*  Ever been threatened? [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5057.42s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5058.26s)]
*  Ever been threatened on the court? [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5059.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5062.18s)]
*  Where? [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5063.099999999999s)]
*  KG. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5065.58s)]
*  Oh, KG came at me a few times. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5066.82s)]
*  Wait, what'd he say? [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5069.3s)]
*  I don't remember exactly what he said. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5070.62s)]
*  So in 09, I didn't play a lot at the time. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5071.98s)]
*  And so Courtney Lee broke his face. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5075.38s)]
*  Dwight Howard hit him, teammates, hit him with the number. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5080.7s)]
*  He was a starter. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5083.62s)]
*  So game six against Philly, closeout game in Philly. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5084.62s)]
*  I start, play well. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5087.18s)]
*  So we then play the defending champs, Boston Celtics. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5089.0599999999995s)]
*  And Stan comes to me, he's like, [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5091.38s)]
*  you're gonna chase Ray Allen for the next however many games. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5092.34s)]
*  He's like, you have no help responsibility. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5095.78s)]
*  He's just chased Ray. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5097.26s)]
*  Oh, sorry, real quick, what's that like? [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5098.099999999999s)]
*  This is Ray, that's your guy. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5098.94s)]
*  Hell. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5100.14s)]
*  Okay. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5101.099999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5101.94s)]
*  But fucking cool probably too. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5102.78s)]
*  It was the coolest thing ever, yeah. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5103.62s)]
*  Okay, so you're chasing him. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5104.46s)]
*  So I'm chasing him. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5105.38s)]
*  So anyways, KG was hurt that series. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5106.74s)]
*  So he's on the bench, but he's still KG. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5110.099999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5112.74s)]
*  He's still animated, talking. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5113.62s)]
*  And it was like every time I would go by their bench, [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5116.66s)]
*  he's got a comment, you know? [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5119.58s)]
*  And then I remember one time we were playing him [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5121.34s)]
*  when he was back in Minnesota. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5125.62s)]
*  This was like 2015ish, whatever. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5127.38s)]
*  I was with the Clippers and he tried me. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5129.54s)]
*  Like, you know what I mean? [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5132.9s)]
*  He tried to get me going, [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5133.86s)]
*  tried to get me to respond to something and I didn't. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5134.7s)]
*  And then I hit a big shot [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5137.22s)]
*  and he told Sam Cassell after that game, [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5138.94s)]
*  he was like, yeah, I knew that white boy [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5140.78s)]
*  was gonna hit something. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5142.1s)]
*  I knew I had to try to get him out of the game. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5143.099999999999s)]
*  I mean. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5144.54s)]
*  This KG, man. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5145.379999999999s)]
*  So the finals that year, you make it, [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5146.219999999999s)]
*  you play the Lakers, it's Kobe. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5148.0199999999995s)]
*  And I mean, it's disrespectful. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5149.82s)]
*  He's probably thinking on some level, [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5150.94s)]
*  oh, I got to avoid the Celtics who beat me last year. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5152.299999999999s)]
*  KG was hurt. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5154.139999999999s)]
*  What's that whole situation like? [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5155.46s)]
*  You're playing the finals the first time, [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5156.94s)]
*  you're playing Kobe. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5158.379999999999s)]
*  What is that like? [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5159.66s)]
*  It was interesting. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5163.78s)]
*  So I started seven straight playoff games. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5165.58s)]
*  I started seven straight playoff games. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5170.0599999999995s)]
*  And then we played Cleveland in the conference championship. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5173.5s)]
*  I didn't play in game one. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5177.54s)]
*  I played nine minutes in the second quarter, [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5179.18s)]
*  had seven points. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5181.14s)]
*  Did not play any of the other games. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5183.14s)]
*  So go into the finals, did not play. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5185.54s)]
*  Why though? [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5188.18s)]
*  In game one, it's a blowout. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5189.0199999999995s)]
*  I get it at the end. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5190.94s)]
*  And the Lakers filled in and take his starters off. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5192.54s)]
*  So Kobe's still out there. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5195.5s)]
*  So I'm guarding him at the end of this game. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5197.14s)]
*  And I hit a three and I think I got like, [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5200.22s)]
*  I'm gonna be not generous, but factual here. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5202.14s)]
*  I think I got two stops against Kobe [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5205.42s)]
*  late in the fourth quarter. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5208.02s)]
*  They're gonna win the game, two stops. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5208.9800000000005s)]
*  But it was like, I battled them. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5210.82s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5212.54s)]
*  Felt good about it. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5213.74s)]
*  So then I'm like, oh. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5215.06s)]
*  So then I played in game two, we lose, we go down 2-0. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5216.46s)]
*  I don't play in game three. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5220.02s)]
*  Game four, I play a lot. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5222.06s)]
*  Game five, I don't play to the end of the game [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5223.06s)]
*  in the fourth quarter. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5225.34s)]
*  So it's a very like up and down thing. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5226.26s)]
*  I always tell people this. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5228.62s)]
*  It wasn't like a highlight because we lost [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5231.14s)]
*  and it fucking hurt so bad. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5233.26s)]
*  And it was the closest I ever got. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5234.82s)]
*  But truthfully, like the high point of my career [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5236.7s)]
*  was getting to guard. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5239.94s)]
*  I guarded Kobe Bryant in the NBA finals. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5240.9s)]
*  There's like, I have multiple pictures saved [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5244.5s)]
*  of like me and him. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5247.5s)]
*  There are pictures of him and I'm in the background. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5249.46s)]
*  But it's like, that's something that, you know. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5251.46s)]
*  My grandkids, for sure. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5255.78s)]
*  The greatest player you've ever played against? [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5258.0199999999995s)]
*  You're gonna put it there? [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5260.66s)]
*  I'm really curious. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5262.339999999999s)]
*  He's the greatest player I ever guarded. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5266.0599999999995s)]
*  Like had to guard. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5267.9s)]
*  I didn't have to guard LeBron. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5269.339999999999s)]
*  I didn't necessarily have to guard Steph. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5271.5s)]
*  But those three guys. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5274.179999999999s)]
*  And I'll put Katie in there too. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5275.7s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5277.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5278.219999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5279.379999999999s)]
*  Those are the four. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5280.219999999999s)]
*  And did you feel like when you were going up against him [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5282.099999999999s)]
*  outside of natural gifts, extreme preparation, [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5284.74s)]
*  did you feel like he just knew what was happening [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5288.58s)]
*  on the floor at all points in time? [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5290.42s)]
*  Toby? [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5292.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5292.86s)]
*  I've told this story once before. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5294.179999999999s)]
*  So my senior year of college was the first year [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5296.3s)]
*  that they did a pool for USA basketball. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5301.38s)]
*  They do this now all the time. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5303.58s)]
*  They say there's 40 names or 25 names, whatever it is, [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5305.42s)]
*  that are being considered for these 12 roster spots. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5308.58s)]
*  At the time it was the 06, it was the World Championships. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5311.3s)]
*  So me and Adam Morrison get named as pool players. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5313.54s)]
*  That first summer I had a herniated disc at L5S1. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5316.86s)]
*  So I didn't do summer league. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5320.14s)]
*  I didn't do USA basketball, but I got to go out and watch. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5321.14s)]
*  The next summer, because they didn't win, [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5323.94s)]
*  they had to qualify. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5326.5s)]
*  So this was like a 12 day training camp prior to qualify. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5328.1s)]
*  So I got to spend time around everybody. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5332.26s)]
*  Two stories from that. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5335.74s)]
*  Number one, first day I get there, [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5336.94s)]
*  I land at whatever noon Vegas time, [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5338.46s)]
*  I hit up Coach Collins and Coach Wojo [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5340.98s)]
*  who were helping Coach K out. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5342.42s)]
*  And I say, I need to get in the gym. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5344.3s)]
*  So I get in the gym. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5345.14s)]
*  Coach Dawkins comes, he looks haggard. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5345.9800000000005s)]
*  Like he looks exhausted. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5348.66s)]
*  I'm like, JD, what the fuck's going on? [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5350.66s)]
*  He's like, Kobe man, he had me in here at 6 a.m. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5353.46s)]
*  He was in here for three hours. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5355.62s)]
*  He was working on the counter to the counter to the counter. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5357.26s)]
*  And he had to make 10 shots in a row. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5359.66s)]
*  Like this was the type of dude. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5361.06s)]
*  All those stories about Kobe being a psycho worker, [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5362.3s)]
*  they're all true. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5364.66s)]
*  So that was cool. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5365.9800000000005s)]
*  End of the first practice comes [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5367.1s)]
*  and Kobe is like, hey, do you want to shoot? [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5368.82s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, yeah, I'll shoot. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5371.7s)]
*  And at the time I'm thinking he wants to shoot with me [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5373.86s)]
*  because he's being a good guy. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5377.18s)]
*  And then we shoot like 15 minutes into it, [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5379.74s)]
*  I realize he's watching how I shoot. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5382.3s)]
*  Watching how I'm catching the ball, watching my footwork. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5385.5s)]
*  He's trying to pick something up. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5388.42s)]
*  And I'm not saying like, oh, he's picking up. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5390.099999999999s)]
*  But he was just always trying to learn. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5392.34s)]
*  He was always trying to get better. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5394.26s)]
*  Oh, I was thinking to defend you. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5395.099999999999s)]
*  I thought he was trying to demoralize you. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5396.62s)]
*  You think you can shoot and watch this. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5398.98s)]
*  He was watching my form. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5400.42s)]
*  Reputation from Duke. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5403.1s)]
*  He was literally watching to try and pick something up. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5404.26s)]
*  And do you think that he caught anything? [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5408.18s)]
*  No, probably not. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5410.02s)]
*  Probably not. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5411.54s)]
*  I wasn't that good. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5412.900000000001s)]
*  I wasn't that good. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5414.14s)]
*  One of my favorite parts of the, [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5415.14s)]
*  what is it, the Redeem Team documentary [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5417.66s)]
*  is when everybody's talking about, [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5419.860000000001s)]
*  Kobe told everybody, we're up at six in the morning. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5421.74s)]
*  Everybody's like, so we started getting up at six more. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5424.7s)]
*  We're working out. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5426.62s)]
*  And then it cuts to mellow and he goes, [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5427.46s)]
*  you know what I'm gonna be honest, [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5430.62s)]
*  I ain't waking up. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5431.46s)]
*  I'm gonna be like. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5432.3s)]
*  I'm gonna be like, hey, are you gonna be honest? [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5433.72s)]
*  I ain't waking up at six. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5434.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm gonna be like, hey, are you gonna be honest? [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5437.1s)]

*  I'm gonna be like, hey, are you gonna be honest? [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5439.62s)]
*  Basha D. Wade, I've told the story [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5440.7s)]
*  where they all go out. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5441.54s)]
*  They all go out. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5442.38s)]
*  They come back. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5443.38s)]
*  They get back to the hotel. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5444.26s)]
*  Kobe's like, they're back at six a.m. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5445.1s)]
*  He's at the breakfast table with ice on his knees [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5447.26s)]
*  because he just got done working out. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5449.58s)]
*  This is fucking psycho shit, man. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5451.02s)]
*  I love it. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5453.06s)]
*  Are there any people that can excel in the NBA [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5453.900000000001s)]
*  without an extreme work ethic? [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5456.46s)]
*  No. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5459.38s)]
*  You just can't do it. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5460.22s)]
*  No. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5461.04s)]
*  Right? [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5461.88s)]
*  No. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5462.72s)]
*  So like explain why. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5463.54s)]
*  Bron and I were talking about this on episode one [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5464.38s)]
*  of our show, Mind the Game. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5466.22s)]
*  Also, if you haven't watched the game. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5467.46s)]
*  No, no. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5469.06s)]
*  Let me plug. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5469.9s)]
*  It literally is because we said it the other day. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5470.74s)]
*  If you haven't watched it, [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5471.58s)]
*  it is the best podcast out right now. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5472.82s)]
*  If you are a casual fan of basketball, [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5474.9800000000005s)]
*  you will be obsessed. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5477.36s)]
*  And if you're obsessed with basketball, [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5478.9800000000005s)]
*  forget this is everything you want. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5480.3s)]
*  They're not trying to water down the game. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5481.94s)]
*  There are two basketball nerds geeking out over basketball [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5484.58s)]
*  and don't give a flying fuck if you understand it or not. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5488.26s)]
*  And I actually like what you did in the beginning [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5492.06s)]
*  where you explained a few of the plays. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5493.9800000000005s)]
*  I thought that was really important. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5495.5s)]
*  And then bringing it out during it was very helpful. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5496.78s)]
*  You get the graphics. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5499.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5500.38s)]
*  Because I saw a social clip and it didn't have it. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5501.22s)]
*  The little clip I saw. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5504.78s)]
*  You know what's funny? [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5505.62s)]
*  There's the only thing we couldn't find something for [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5506.46s)]
*  after the fact, we found it on WNBA [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5508.68s)]
*  and we found it in college basketball. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5511.1s)]
*  Because. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5512.58s)]
*  Because of that coverage of the baseline out of bounds play, [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5513.58s)]
*  we couldn't find it in the NBA. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5515.14s)]
*  It's interesting. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5516.62s)]
*  And now people have posted shit on. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5517.46s)]
*  This was the thunder in 2019. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5520.14s)]
*  Motherfucker, I couldn't find that clip. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5522.34s)]
*  But I remember seeing that clip [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5524.26s)]
*  before I watched the episode going, [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5525.58s)]
*  oh, it'd be so nice if they had graphics or something [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5527.02s)]
*  so we would understand. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5529.62s)]
*  And then the beginning of the episode, [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5530.46s)]
*  you're explaining these few plays. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5532.26s)]
*  Anyway, it's fucking awesome. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5533.66s)]
*  I'm sure all of you have already watched it. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5535.06s)]
*  If not, go watch it. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5536.7s)]
*  And they're continuing to release episodes. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5537.54s)]
*  So you were saying. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5539.14s)]
*  Anyways, the only reason it popped in my brain [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5539.9800000000005s)]
*  is because we put the social clip out today [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5542.46s)]
*  where he talks about this. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5543.9400000000005s)]
*  The idea of being elite in the NBA [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5545.18s)]
*  and not working to an extreme level. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5548.46s)]
*  It's impossible. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5551.38s)]
*  And the thing he says, which I laughed at [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5552.38s)]
*  and I think it's hilarious, is he said, [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5554.54s)]
*  what does discipline mean? [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5557.38s)]
*  Discipline means you sacrifice loved ones. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5558.4800000000005s)]
*  That was crazy. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5561.26s)]
*  It's actually. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5563.7s)]
*  I thought what you said was great too, [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5566.3s)]
*  which is you're like, I've said to my wife and family, [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5567.66s)]
*  this is a selfish endeavor. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5570.26s)]
*  I had so much guilt over that. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5571.82s)]
*  And then my wife, like I'm traveling all season. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5573.46s)]
*  I'm traveling all season, right? [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5579.179999999999s)]
*  We have 41 road games, playoffs. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5580.82s)]
*  I'm locked in. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5583.98s)]
*  There was a time I had to guard James Harden a lot [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5585.44s)]
*  when I played for the Clippers and he was on the Rockets [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5588.5s)]
*  and we had a Sunday ABC game [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5590.34s)]
*  and her family was in town, her parents and her aunt. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5592.58s)]
*  We went to this little Mexican place in Manhattan Beach [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5597.799999999999s)]
*  and I was fucking zoned out. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5602.12s)]
*  Of course. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5603.5199999999995s)]
*  Kimberly Martin in the green room today. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5604.36s)]
*  I was zoned out thinking about, [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5606.419999999999s)]
*  what am I doing with my footwork [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5609.0s)]
*  when James goes to this move, right? [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5610.2s)]
*  I'm thinking about this shit. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5611.679999999999s)]
*  We get home, Chelsea's like, [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5613.4s)]
*  where the fuck were you at dinner? [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5615.599999999999s)]
*  And I was like, I'm literally thinking about [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5617.16s)]
*  guarding James Harden tomorrow. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5618.4s)]
*  I'm sorry, I couldn't be there. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5619.5199999999995s)]
*  So not only when I was in season, [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5621.2s)]
*  when I wasn't like on the road, [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5623.219999999999s)]
*  I wasn't there all the time, right? [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5626.36s)]
*  And so I had this tremendous sense of guilt [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5629.2s)]
*  and I found this quote about striving, [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5631.639999999999s)]
*  striving for greatness is the stupidest thing [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5636.4s)]
*  but it wasn't the quote, [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5638.0s)]
*  but it's like, that is a selfish pursuit [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5639.04s)]
*  and I had to accept it and live with it. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5641.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5644.12s)]
*  Yeah, it sucks. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5644.96s)]
*  And the people that love you also have to accept it. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5645.78s)]
*  Yeah, and Chelsea has, thank God. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5647.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5649.04s)]
*  Thank God. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5649.88s)]
*  But it's a good perspective to have [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5650.7s)]
*  because it's very easy to flip it and frame it as, [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5652.12s)]
*  hey, I'm a provider and that's all I do. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5655.64s)]
*  And it's like, no, no, no, [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5657.6s)]
*  we do this for ourselves too. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5658.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5659.6s)]
*  And the people that love us understand that it, [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5660.4400000000005s)]
*  feeds our souls as well. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5662.6s)]
*  And then we also happen to provide a pretty awesome life [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5664.0s)]
*  and that's great, people benefit. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5666.280000000001s)]
*  But once you got that 23 million from the 76ers, [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5667.88s)]
*  you could have taken off a little bit, [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5673.12s)]
*  but you're like, fuck it, send me to Dallas. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5674.6s)]
*  This is my problem in life. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5676.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5678.88s)]
*  It's a good thing and a bad thing. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5679.72s)]
*  Okay. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5680.68s)]
*  So I was very routine oriented [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5681.52s)]
*  and it wasn't just the routine of like, [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5685.8s)]
*  oh, this is how I'm gonna put my socks on. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5687.84s)]
*  I meant the work. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5689.24s)]
*  The work was very routine. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5690.12s)]
*  And so what happened throughout my career is, [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5691.76s)]
*  this is my baseline level of work. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5694.719999999999s)]
*  And once it became manageable, [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5696.719999999999s)]
*  this is my baseline level of work. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5698.5599999999995s)]
*  And once it became manageable, this is my baseline. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5700.2s)]
*  And the same fucking thing is happening right now. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5702.36s)]
*  I can see it. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5704.599999999999s)]
*  In media. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5705.5599999999995s)]
*  You got three podcasts. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5706.4s)]
*  It's like, last year I added a second show on Monday. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5707.219999999999s)]
*  I started calling games full time. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5711.5599999999995s)]
*  It was a little bit of a trip [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5713.5s)]
*  and then I got to the point I was like, [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5715.360000000001s)]
*  okay, I've figured out how to manage this. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5716.2s)]
*  And all of a sudden it's like, [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5717.72s)]
*  all right, let's do a LeBron show. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5718.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5720.64s)]
*  You know? [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5721.4800000000005s)]
*  And it's, I don't think there's anything [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5722.320000000001s)]
*  beyond this for me. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5724.64s)]
*  I can't, I don't know if I can add anything else. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5725.56s)]
*  This is it. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5726.84s)]
*  But at the same time, you're filling your plate. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5727.68s)]
*  I imagine you're not the guy who's just gonna be able [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5730.0s)]
*  to sit back, relax and sip a mandjula. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5731.76s)]
*  You need a cook. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5734.08s)]
*  All right guys, we're gonna take a break real quick [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5735.04s)]
*  because we gotta talk about the world's [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5736.6s)]
*  largest smart wallet brand right here. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5737.96s)]
*  This bad boy, Xter. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5739.76s)]
*  I actually, that's ours. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5741.04s)]
*  It's a flagrant Xter that they made [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5742.92s)]
*  that they sold out of, but obviously that's the one we use. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5744.52s)]
*  This is an innovative solution designed to improve [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5746.72s)]
*  everything about your wallet. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5750.0s)]
*  First of all, it has two key tracker features. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5751.84s)]
*  I mean, it's trackable worldwide. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5754.6s)]
*  That means if you lose your wallet all the time like me [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5756.4800000000005s)]
*  or if somebody steals it, you can track it. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5758.6s)]
*  It's also voice activated. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5760.56s)]
*  So if you lose your wallet in the house, [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5761.76s)]
*  just call that shit. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5763.240000000001s)]
*  It works with Google Home. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5764.080000000001s)]
*  It works with Alexa. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5765.0s)]
*  It works with Siri. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5765.84s)]
*  It works with everything. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5766.660000000001s)]
*  And most importantly, if you travel a lot, [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5767.5s)]
*  these wallets offer RFID protection. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5769.64s)]
*  It happens. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5772.360000000001s)]
*  They just, I don't know how. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5773.18s)]
*  They don't even need your wallet anymore. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5774.580000000001s)]
*  They just boop, they take all your information. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5775.740000000001s)]
*  This offers RFID protection, which basically means [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5777.580000000001s)]

*  Let's get back to the show. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5909.5s)]
*  Oh yeah, on that note, I wanna tell you this [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5910.5s)]
*  while we're on air. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5911.86s)]
*  I'm not being hyperbolic. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5912.7s)]
*  I think you are truly changing the way [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5913.66s)]
*  basketball is analyzed. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5915.139999999999s)]
*  I think a lot of it before was guys kinda like me [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5917.5s)]
*  who was not really athletic, just saying things. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5919.74s)]
*  And then to have a basketball player [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5922.18s)]
*  who played at a high level wasn't just a catch and shoot guy [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5924.1s)]
*  but then talking about unapologetically, [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5927.62s)]
*  here is what my opinions are at the highest level. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5930.5s)]
*  I think it sets a precedent now [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5934.1s)]
*  for what this starts to become, basketball analysis. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5935.64s)]
*  Maybe sports analysis. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5939.24s)]
*  And I'm not being hyperbolic. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5940.42s)]
*  I really think you are changing the trajectory [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5941.58s)]
*  of what a sports analyst is. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5943.72s)]
*  That's really interesting because before [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5944.94s)]
*  maybe the basketball guys weren't skilled [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5946.66s)]
*  at the analysis part and then just speaking on camera part. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5948.54s)]
*  The communication part. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5951.42s)]
*  Yeah, the communication part is hard. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5952.26s)]
*  It's an art also, right? [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5953.62s)]
*  And people are doing that, [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5954.74s)]
*  dedicating their whole lives to do it. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5955.78s)]
*  But now you have an expectation where [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5957.22s)]
*  not only should you be able to communicate effectively, [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5959.18s)]
*  you better have also played the game. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5962.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5966.26s)]
*  I wanna respond to what you just said [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5967.62s)]
*  and I appreciate that. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5969.0199999999995s)]
*  And it's like, truly, I mean this. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5970.0199999999995s)]
*  It means something to me to hear you say that. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5972.42s)]
*  It doesn't mean a lot. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5975.42s)]
*  It just means something. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5976.26s)]
*  No, no, no, it does. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5977.08s)]
*  It does. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5977.92s)]
*  Because you recognize, I think, what is important to me. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5978.76s)]
*  I wanna be clear on this though. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5986.1s)]
*  I don't want to change anything. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5987.1s)]
*  I want to fill a void. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5989.86s)]
*  Because there are always gonna be people [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5993.06s)]
*  that wanna be entertained in a certain way. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5994.5s)]
*  Sports is an escape. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5996.7s)]
*  Fandom is an escape. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5998.38s)]
*  And that's important. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=5999.9400000000005s)]
*  Like, how am I taxed as an NBA player? [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6001.34s)]
*  I'm taxed as an entertainer. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6004.86s)]
*  I know what I'm providing. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6006.0599999999995s)]
*  Fandom is part of people's identity. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6008.94s)]
*  It's an escape. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6010.88s)]
*  And in some ways, sports media is that too. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6012.0599999999995s)]
*  So I'm not trying to change anything. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6014.219999999999s)]
*  I'm trying to fill a void for what I see. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6016.78s)]
*  And it's interesting, when you first came on the air, [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6019.179999999999s)]
*  I remember thinking, oh, this has been missing. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6021.219999999999s)]
*  And now I'm looking at you and like, [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6023.219999999999s)]
*  oh, I don't know, it's not a Pandora's Box, [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6024.62s)]
*  the only parallel I can think of. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6027.179999999999s)]
*  But now that we've seen this. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6028.0199999999995s)]
*  Maybe there's another way to add [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6030.42s)]
*  to the ancillary coverage of sport. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6034.14s)]
*  Yes. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6036.18s)]
*  And the ancillary way we talk about sports. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6037.02s)]
*  It kind of feels like when Tony Romo started announcing, [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6038.740000000001s)]
*  and he started breaking down the game a little bit more [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6041.740000000001s)]
*  and less just trying to entertain. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6044.14s)]
*  And that's what I feel. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6045.9400000000005s)]
*  And he was guessing plays. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6047.3s)]
*  And it was really exciting to watch, [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6048.780000000001s)]
*  because he'd be right. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6050.14s)]
*  And the difference here is, [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6051.26s)]
*  when you hear guys who comment on sports, [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6052.740000000001s)]
*  like broadcasting, they will say, [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6055.3s)]
*  Romo seems to have gotten lazier, for lack of a better word. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6056.820000000001s)]
*  I don't think anybody's ever gonna say that about you. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6060.860000000001s)]
*  I hope not. It's constant crap. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6062.9400000000005s)]
*  It's constant knowing the game in and out [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6064.7s)]
*  and just like obsession. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6066.0199999999995s)]
*  How do NBA players go broke? [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6067.42s)]
*  They don't anymore. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6069.86s)]
*  Is that right? [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6070.78s)]
*  Why is that? [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6071.86s)]
*  Shocked, bro. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6072.7s)]
*  I'd be shocked. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6073.54s)]
*  Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6074.38s)]
*  All right. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6075.58s)]
*  So I'll tell you how it happens. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6076.42s)]
*  Happened more. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6078.62s)]
*  So I don't know what the average, [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6081.0599999999995s)]
*  but during my career, [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6083.299999999999s)]
*  the average NBA career was like four and a half years, [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6084.42s)]
*  roughly. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6087.179999999999s)]
*  So if you play four and a half years, [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6088.0199999999995s)]
*  that means you're not getting to a real second contract. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6090.06s)]
*  You're likely making 750, 1.2, 1.5. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6094.1s)]
*  Maybe you get an exception, 2.9. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6098.46s)]
*  So you've made $8 million over four and a half years. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6100.54s)]
*  Let's call it, you've made $10 million over five years. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6103.1s)]
*  All right. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6105.9400000000005s)]
*  You've got $5 million to spend. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6106.780000000001s)]
*  You're in the NBA. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6108.9800000000005s)]
*  You're gonna get a nice car. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6109.820000000001s)]
*  You're probably gonna buy a nice house, [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6110.660000000001s)]
*  but you're gonna take care of your parents. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6111.780000000001s)]
*  Before you spend another dollar, [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6113.26s)]
*  you're like, you gotta pay your agent. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6115.900000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6118.620000000001s)]
*  How is that supposed to last you the rest of your life? [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6120.3s)]
*  It's, yeah. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6123.22s)]
*  There were guys that I played with [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6124.54s)]
*  that I felt at the time, [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6125.9800000000005s)]
*  oh, you played 10 years and you made $35 million. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6128.66s)]
*  All right, do the math on that. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6131.78s)]
*  Do the math on that. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6133.38s)]
*  Add in the spending. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6134.22s)]
*  Add in the spending. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6135.5s)]
*  That's how it happens. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6136.34s)]
*  Like my financial advisor, he told me that from day one. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6137.22s)]
*  I'm like, it's all about spending. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6139.18s)]
*  It's not all about the intake. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6141.3s)]
*  It's the outtake too. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6142.54s)]
*  It's what you go spend money on, right? [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6144.02s)]
*  Now, the reason I say it's just not gonna happen [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6146.86s)]
*  as much now is have you fucking seen these contracts? [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6149.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they're making big money. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6151.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6152.62s)]
*  Even the rookies? [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6153.46s)]
*  What's a rookie contract? [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6154.5s)]
*  They changed the rookie scale. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6155.46s)]
*  Okay. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6157.06s)]
*  They changed the rookie scale. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6157.900000000001s)]
*  So like my rookie contract was four years, 8.9, [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6158.72s)]
*  which was, I mean, I was broke. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6164.900000000001s)]
*  We did not have money. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6167.7s)]
*  That was a shitload of money, right? [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6168.9800000000005s)]
*  Very grateful for every dollar I made. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6171.900000000001s)]
*  The 11th pick now, I don't know the exact number. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6175.02s)]
*  He's probably making 20. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6178.14s)]
*  Okay. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6179.9800000000005s)]
*  So even with your reference, most of my career, [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6180.820000000001s)]
*  the mid-level exception was around $5 million a year. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6184.0s)]
*  And now? [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6186.780000000001s)]
*  Which was like, you're a rotation player. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6187.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6189.700000000001s)]
*  What is it now? [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6190.54s)]
*  The average. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6191.360000000001s)]
*  It's 12 and a half. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6192.200000000001s)]
*  So a max contract, think about coming out of the lockout. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6193.04s)]
*  Coming out of the lockout. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6196.5s)]
*  There were a few guys that were on the rookie deals [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6198.02s)]
*  that went and signed a max contract, right? [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6200.740000000001s)]
*  And it was like four years, 58. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6203.26s)]
*  Vince Carter and Chauncey Billups, [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6206.14s)]
*  when you're signed max contracts, four years, 64. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6208.02s)]
*  Jaylen Brown just signed a max contract, [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6210.9800000000005s)]
*  five years, $304 million. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6212.58s)]
*  Jeez. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6214.34s)]
*  There's a difference. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6215.18s)]
*  Wow. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6216.34s)]
*  Okay, so even those guys that are just getting [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6217.18s)]
*  that rookie deal are probably making life-changing money. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6218.860000000001s)]
*  Zion Williamson, number one pick. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6222.18s)]
*  He made $44 million on his rookie deal. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6223.54s)]
*  On his rookie. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6227.14s)]
*  And if you get to that second contract, forget it. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6227.9800000000005s)]
*  But you, it was your third or your fourth [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6230.780000000001s)]
*  contract that where you actually really made money. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6233.58s)]
*  I did, were you pocket watching here? [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6235.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6237.98s)]
*  Son, I got the notes, I got the notes. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6238.94s)]
*  Cause I know about the big- [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6240.54s)]
*  The Philly deal. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6242.42s)]
*  The Philly deal was- [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6243.26s)]
*  So I did a three year deal with Chicago that was good money. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6244.5s)]
*  I did a four year deal with LA that was good money. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6247.98s)]
*  Those were both around like six or seven a year. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6250.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6252.0599999999995s)]
*  And then Philly, and then I did another one year deal [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6252.9s)]
*  with Philly, and then I did a two year deal with New Orleans. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6255.18s)]
*  What'd you get for yourself when you did the, [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6256.82s)]
*  when you got that Philly deal? [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6258.82s)]
*  Cause I know that that's a nice, real special thing. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6259.78s)]
*  You had to get yourself something nice. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6261.9s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6262.74s)]
*  I, that was 2017. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6263.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6267.5s)]
*  For like five years, I was obsessed with vintage watches. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6268.34s)]
*  Ooh. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6271.74s)]
*  Obsessed. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6272.58s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6273.42s)]
*  Like I'm an obsessive deep diver person. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6274.26s)]
*  No. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6275.82s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, so I like, I collected whatever. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6276.66s)]
*  I had one point I was like, am I a dealer? [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6279.0199999999995s)]
*  Am I a watch dealer? [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6281.099999999999s)]
*  Is that my thing? [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6282.66s)]
*  Okay, what'd you get yourself? [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6284.0599999999995s)]
*  So I'm gonna tell you. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6285.099999999999s)]
*  So 2017, my parents were fucking stressed to the nines. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6286.54s)]
*  They'd been retired for a few years, [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6290.82s)]
*  but like not enjoying it. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6292.78s)]
*  So I called them up to New York. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6294.58s)]
*  I had all my, I'm one of five, we'd all the siblings come in [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6299.58s)]
*  and we're basically like, pick a city [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6302.54s)]
*  where you have grandkids. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6306.38s)]
*  So you can live in New York, you can live in Denver, [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6307.74s)]
*  you can live in Raleigh, but you gotta pick a city. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6309.5s)]
*  I'm gonna buy you a house and I'm gonna, you know. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6311.9s)]
*  Take care of it. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6315.54s)]
*  Yeah, I'm gonna take care of you, take care of it. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6316.38s)]
*  So that's essentially what I did with, not all the money. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6318.46s)]
*  Man, I thought you were gonna tell us a watch store. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6322.22s)]
*  Didn't you sell the watches to get that? [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6324.02s)]
*  I didn't have a car when I moved to New York [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6327.22s)]
*  because I had like a deal where I had a free Tahoe. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6329.7s)]
*  So I had this Tahoe and I moved to New York, [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6332.58s)]
*  I'm not gonna have a Tahoe in New York. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6335.58s)]
*  So I gave it back to the dealership in LA [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6336.9800000000005s)]
*  and I get to New York and I'm like, [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6339.18s)]
*  what's the cheapest nice car I can lease? [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6341.02s)]
*  This was after I signed my deal. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6344.26s)]
*  I've gotta get a Range Rover Sport. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6345.94s)]
*  So I'm driving that to Gainesville. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6348.14s)]
*  Nice car? [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6348.9800000000005s)]

*  let me coast a little bit. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6378.54s)]

*  It's so corny. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6385.0199999999995s)]

*  That's fine. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6390.62s)]
*  I remember there were guys, [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6391.46s)]
*  so my McDonald's All-American game [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6392.28s)]
*  was in Madison Square Garden. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6393.82s)]
*  Okay. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6395.259999999999s)]

*  I remember being there and getting the sense like, [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6397.94s)]
*  everybody, all everybody was talking about like, [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6400.179999999999s)]

*  That was not my mindset. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6403.62s)]
*  My mindset was like, [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6405.0199999999995s)]
*  I want to destroy these motherfuckers this week. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6406.42s)]

*  There was never like, this sense of I made it. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6413.78s)]
*  Even like late Mike, there was a paranoia. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6417.7s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6420.7s)]
*  I'm sure you feel that. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6421.86s)]
*  A paranoia about what? [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6422.7s)]
*  You guys don't feel that? [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6423.52s)]
*  No, no, we might. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6424.36s)]
*  We might just explain what you're saying. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6425.2s)]
*  A paranoia that somebody's going to take your shit. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6426.02s)]
*  Yes. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6427.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6428.78s)]
*  That everything you work for isn't really going to work out. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6429.62s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6431.5s)]
*  And I don't want to call it imposter syndrome, [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6432.34s)]
*  but there's a, like I think, [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6433.7s)]
*  I think people that are just like, [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6435.06s)]
*  I want to be great at this thing. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6438.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6440.660000000001s)]
*  It's, there's, I guess what? [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6441.5s)]
*  There's a lot of people that want to be great at basketball. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6443.18s)]
*  There's a lot of people. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6445.620000000001s)]
*  You know, young guys would come in every year. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6447.18s)]
*  There's 30 first round picks. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6449.38s)]
*  There's 30 second round picks. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6450.64s)]
*  There's guys coming over from overseas. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6452.14s)]
*  And you're like, all right, my job, [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6454.02s)]
*  like everybody wants my job. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6456.22s)]
*  I'm going to have to do everything I can to keep it. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6458.3s)]
*  It wasn't, I wanted to make money. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6460.580000000001s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6462.900000000001s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6463.740000000001s)]
*  I wanted this suit. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6464.96s)]
*  But is it hard to separate that? [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6466.160000000001s)]
*  Like you have to be on a team. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6468.52s)]
*  You have to congeal. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6469.84s)]
*  You have to believe in these guys. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6470.68s)]
*  They have to fight for you. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6472.200000000001s)]
*  They have to support you. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6473.04s)]
*  But at the same time, [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6474.160000000001s)]
*  their ability to provide for their families [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6475.320000000001s)]
*  could be affected by you. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6477.64s)]
*  And your ability to provide for your family [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6479.080000000001s)]
*  could be affected by them. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6481.0s)]
*  They're trying to come for your spot. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6482.04s)]
*  Can you ever really like love one another [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6483.72s)]
*  and really get on the same page? [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6486.56s)]
*  There's a, that's always underlying [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6489.0s)]
*  in professional sports. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6491.200000000001s)]
*  Particularly in, I rarely believe this, [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6493.04s)]
*  particularly in basketball. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6496.2s)]
*  You know, baseball, you bat every nine times. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6498.679999999999s)]
*  It's, you play a position. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6501.2s)]
*  You're specialized. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6503.4s)]
*  You don't know when a guy's going to hit a grounder [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6504.679999999999s)]
*  to the shortstop, right? [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6507.48s)]
*  Pitchers, they pitch every five days. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6509.599999999999s)]
*  Football, same sort of deal. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6512.679999999999s)]
*  I'm sure there's internal competition for a position. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6514.839999999999s)]
*  But again, there's a job that the left tackle has to do. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6517.08s)]
*  There's a job that the tight end has to do. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6519.96s)]
*  In basketball, it's like everybody has a job for sure, [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6523.0s)]
*  but it requires a lot. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6526.0s)]
*  Soccer's a similar thing. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6527.4s)]
*  It requires a lot. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6528.96s)]
*  And typically, the people that score the most [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6530.679999999999s)]
*  get the most, right? [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6534.0s)]
*  There's a finite amount of resources. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6535.12s)]
*  So it's always underlying. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6536.5599999999995s)]
*  But I never felt like, at least the locker rooms I was in, [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6538.48s)]
*  there was this competition to like, [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6542.08s)]
*  if I get this, you don't get this. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6544.679999999999s)]
*  I never felt that. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6548.2s)]
*  There was never anybody coming for your spot. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6549.32s)]
*  When you're starting with the Clippers, [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6551.44s)]
*  you never felt, well, I guess Jamal would be the one [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6552.879999999999s)]
*  coming in, but like, there was never at any team [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6554.839999999999s)]
*  where you were starting to get more minutes [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6557.879999999999s)]
*  and you were taking them, quote, unquote, from somebody. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6559.04s)]
*  My first year in Philly, we made the conference finals. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6560.879999999999s)]
*  I was the second leading scorer on the team. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6563.879999999999s)]
*  And we, our five man starting lineup had the best, [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6565.879999999999s)]
*  it was the best five man starting lineup [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6570.08s)]
*  in the entire NBA that year. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6571.4s)]
*  Turns like net rating per 100 possessions or whatever. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6573.12s)]
*  And they come to me my second year and they said, [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6575.32s)]
*  we want to start Markel Foltz. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6579.5199999999995s)]
*  And I said, okay, that's fine. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6582.28s)]
*  No, because I, [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6583.679999999999s)]
*  Cause you just made 23 minutes. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6585.759999999999s)]
*  No, no, no, it wasn't that at all. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6586.92s)]
*  It was, it was like, I remember Brett Brown, [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6589.719999999999s)]
*  he got like a six minute recording from Manu Janobili [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6591.719999999999s)]
*  talking about, Manu was talking, it was to me, [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6595.24s)]
*  Manu was talking about, you know, [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6597.639999999999s)]
*  these emotional experience of Pop telling me [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6599.639999999999s)]
*  he was going to come off the bench and not start. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6602.04s)]
*  And I, we got done with the recording. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6604.24s)]
*  I was like, I love Manu, he was one of my favorite players [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6605.88s)]
*  ever. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6608.2s)]
*  I was like, Brett, you didn't have to do that. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6609.04s)]
*  I literally don't care. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6609.92s)]
*  Because I knew, [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6611.64s)]
*  No, because I knew like, [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6612.48s)]
*  I was going to, I was going to play 30 minutes a game. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6613.44s)]
*  I was going to, I was going to get two man action with Joel. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6615.44s)]
*  I was going to be on the break with Ben Simmons [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6617.92s)]
*  doing catch and shoot threes. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6620.48s)]
*  Like it was like, [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6621.84s)]
*  I didn't know it was going to happen. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6623.08s)]
*  Well one of y'all got to shoot three, [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6623.92s)]
*  it ain't going to be Ben. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6624.76s)]
*  Why do I, why do I, I don't care about fucking starting. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6625.6s)]
*  It was important at one point in my life [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6628.36s)]
*  to be like, I'm a starter in the NBA. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6630.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6632.28s)]
*  Once that happened, I didn't fuck it. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6633.12s)]
*  Okay, so once you checked that off, it wasn't there. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6634.2s)]
*  Okay, Coach K. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6635.92s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6637.8s)]
*  Exceptional, my understanding is exceptional leader. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6639.0s)]
*  That's what I've been told by people. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6643.64s)]
*  Maybe not the X's and O's or offensive genius, [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6645.56s)]
*  like Mike D'Antoni, [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6650.44s)]
*  but in terms of his ability to get people on the same page [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6651.52s)]
*  and lead exceptional. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6654.6s)]
*  Was that your experience with him? [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6657.04s)]
*  Yes. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6658.44s)]
*  Okay, and what makes him so exceptional? [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6659.28s)]
*  Say two things about, [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6665.08s)]
*  well I'll say three things about Coach. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6666.12s)]
*  Number one, my dad is like my hero. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6667.52s)]
*  Coach is the next guy. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6671.6s)]
*  And then it's like everybody else. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6673.88s)]
*  And I've been around some fucking phenomenal people. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6675.360000000001s)]
*  And I had some great mentors and some great coaches. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6678.080000000001s)]
*  But those two guys, they're just, they're special. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6681.160000000001s)]
*  Second thing is, I never saw him have a bad day. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6684.92s)]
*  Did he make mistakes? [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6689.160000000001s)]
*  Sure, he made mistakes like a substitution or a game plan. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6690.0s)]
*  Like he made mistakes. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6694.64s)]
*  But I never, he put every single thing into every day. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6695.92s)]
*  Wright Thompson wrote this article on him [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6700.52s)]
*  during his last season. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6702.36s)]
*  It's this notion like Coach would light himself on fire. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6703.56s)]
*  And we all saw that. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6707.6s)]
*  We all saw that. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6709.28s)]
*  We get back from Blacksburg, Virginia after a loss [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6710.12s)]
*  and we have a two hour meeting at 3 a.m. in the morning [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6712.24s)]
*  and come to practice the next day. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6715.2s)]
*  Ah, Coach was in here at 6 a.m. watching film. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6717.56s)]
*  He went home, showered, said hi to Mickey, [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6720.2s)]
*  said hi to his dogs, came back. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6722.28s)]
*  Like he was fully invested at all times. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6723.96s)]
*  It was an incredible lesson to learn [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6728.0s)]
*  when you're 19 years old, what that looks like. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6729.84s)]
*  And I got to see it. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6732.12s)]
*  The other thing I would say is like, [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6733.28s)]
*  when people talk about him, the good qualities, [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6734.4400000000005s)]
*  the leadership qualities, the communication, [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6737.4400000000005s)]
*  the motivation qualities, they're all true and then some. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6739.56s)]
*  Like they're all true. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6742.8s)]
*  And how would he motivate you? [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6744.08s)]
*  Did he lock in specifically to a part of your personality [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6745.2s)]
*  and coach you in a unique way? [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6748.92s)]
*  There were certain guys that required like a little nudging. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6754.4s)]
*  I was not one of those guys, but I still got tested a lot. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6761.08s)]
*  And sometimes it was just like a word. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6765.76s)]
*  You're being. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6770.36s)]
*  Catch and shooty. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6771.6s)]
*  No, you're being, yeah, you're being this. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6772.4400000000005s)]
*  A bitch? [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6774.56s)]
*  Yeah, like that sort of thing. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6775.4s)]
*  Oh really, he would use curse words. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6776.24s)]
*  No, I mean, not like, I'm not using that word. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6777.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6779.4800000000005s)]
*  Playing like a pussy. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6780.32s)]
*  The implication that, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6781.16s)]
*  Or something like that. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6782.4800000000005s)]
*  It was like that. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6783.48s)]
*  Or like I remember one time it was, you're being a brat. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6784.32s)]
*  I was like, fuck, you're a fraud. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6787.44s)]
*  You're an entitled prick. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6789.759999999999s)]
*  Like it was stuff like that. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6791.5599999999995s)]
*  So he would play into what he thought [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6792.4s)]
*  maybe your insecurities were and then. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6795.24s)]
*  Some of that came from Coach Collins too, [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6797.4s)]
*  but they obviously talked. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6798.759999999999s)]
*  So it's like, yeah, it was just like that stuff. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6800.799999999999s)]
*  The worst thing that any coach has ever said to me [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6805.08s)]
*  was came from Coach K. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6806.84s)]
*  And it was after my sophomore year, [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6807.84s)]
*  really struggled that year, wanted to quit. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6810.44s)]
*  That was like the height of like, everybody hates me. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6813.360000000001s)]
*  JJ. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6816.08s)]
*  Yeah, everybody hates me. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6816.92s)]
*  Tried to quit in December. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6817.92s)]
*  My sisters talked me out of it. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6818.88s)]
*  Really struggled second semester. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6821.08s)]
*  I played well for most of the season, [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6822.56s)]
*  but I really struggled. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6825.12s)]
*  Started taking antidepressants, started seeing a therapist. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6826.8s)]
*  And I was a fucking knucklehead. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6830.08s)]
*  I was out. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6832.4800000000005s)]
*  I was like living the frat life [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6833.88s)]
*  and trying to play Duke basketball. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6835.8s)]
*  And like they knew that this was happening. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6837.4800000000005s)]
*  So the season ends. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6839.92s)]
*  So for four straight Saturdays, [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6841.4s)]
*  he made me come in at 8 a.m. to meet with him. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6843.44s)]
*  And in one of those meetings, [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6845.879999999999s)]
*  we lost to UConn in the final four that year. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6847.32s)]
*  And in one of those meetings, he said to me, [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6849.599999999999s)]
*  we didn't win a national championship [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6851.2s)]
*  because you weren't worthy of being a champion. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6853.44s)]
*  And that fucking crushed me. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6856.16s)]
*  And it changed my life also. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6858.44s)]
*  How? [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6860.2s)]
*  No coach could ever say that about me again. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6861.4s)]
*  In that you were always prepared, always dedicated. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6864.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, great teammate, all that stuff. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6867.24s)]
*  Now does Coach K know, this is what I'm assuming, [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6869.48s)]
*  he knows that you have the constitution [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6871.799999999999s)]
*  to handle criticism like that? [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6873.679999999999s)]
*  And that that is a motivator. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6875.679999999999s)]
*  Where some people that might kind of crumble them. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6877.719999999999s)]
*  I think that's one of his gifts. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6880.959999999999s)]
*  I think that's one of his gifts. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6882.919999999999s)]
*  Is to what measure character? [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6884.0s)]
*  No, no, just like knowing what is required with each player. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6885.839999999999s)]
*  I coach my kids' trough team. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6890.639999999999s)]
*  And some of that is like, I can talk to this kid this way. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6894.879999999999s)]
*  It's not just like verbal confrontation. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6900.12s)]
*  It's how you coach a kid. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6902.5599999999995s)]
*  Trying to figure out how they're motivated, [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6904.12s)]
*  what their triggers are, getting them to get by [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6908.08s)]
*  and all that stuff. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6911.5599999999995s)]
*  He has a gift with figuring that out [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6912.4s)]
*  for each individual guy. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6914.5599999999995s)]
*  That was part of his gift, I think. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6916.44s)]
*  Would he set aside time to figure out each one of you? [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6920.36s)]
*  So there would be non-basketball activities. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6923.76s)]
*  You guys were just meeting in the office, like what? [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6925.96s)]
*  Two meetings that stand out. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6928.56s)]
*  As soon as I got on campus, I just turned 18 years old. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6930.320000000001s)]
*  And he met with every freshman. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6934.72s)]
*  We were doing summer school before our freshman year. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6937.72s)]
*  And he had me in there and he said, [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6941.400000000001s)]
*  what do you hope to accomplish at Duke? [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6943.88s)]
*  That's the framework. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6946.76s)]
*  So he holds onto that. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6949.52s)]
*  Going into my second year, we had the same sort of meeting. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6953.200000000001s)]
*  What do you wanna do this year? [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6956.0s)]
*  And I had written down these goals. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6957.6s)]
*  I tell him the goals and he goes, [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6961.4800000000005s)]
*  and what exactly have you done this summer [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6963.56s)]
*  to accomplish that? [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6965.280000000001s)]
*  Like I think to going back, we're gonna go full circle here. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6968.64s)]
*  Going back to high school, I always practiced [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6971.88s)]
*  and I always worked. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6975.320000000001s)]
*  I didn't miss games. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6976.56s)]
*  I was always in it. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6977.72s)]
*  Going back to high school, because it was easier, [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6979.68s)]
*  there was this, it was wrong to think this way, [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6982.68s)]
*  but it's the truth. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6985.92s)]
*  In high school, it's like, well, I'm gonna grow. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6986.84s)]
*  I'm gonna get stronger. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6989.24s)]
*  I'm gonna get a new level of testosterone [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6990.8s)]
*  and I'm gonna be better than I was last year. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6994.4400000000005s)]
*  And I'm gonna be better than I was the year before. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6997.320000000001s)]
*  And then you get to your senior year, [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=6999.0s)]
*  like, okay, I'm really good. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7000.84s)]
*  I'm better than I was as a freshman. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7001.8s)]
*  And the older you get, it just doesn't work that way. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7003.4400000000005s)]
*  You step up a level of competition and it's like, [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7007.24s)]
*  so I had a good freshman year and my mindset was like, [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7009.68s)]
*  I did what they asked me to do, but I didn't do extra. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7014.92s)]
*  I didn't go above and beyond. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7018.4800000000005s)]
*  Here's a conditioning. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7020.16s)]
*  Okay, I'll do the conditioning workout, [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7021.280000000001s)]
*  but I didn't try to win the conditioning workout. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7023.08s)]
*  That's the difference. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7025.400000000001s)]
*  And so once I, and it was really between my sophomore [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7027.12s)]
*  and junior, once I got that in my brain, [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7029.4400000000005s)]
*  I was like, what are you willing to do [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7031.16s)]
*  that no one else is willing to do? [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7033.56s)]
*  Okay, now I can actually write down some things [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7035.72s)]
*  on a piece of paper and try to go accomplish that. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7037.9800000000005s)]
*  What'd you write down that year? [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7040.84s)]
*  I never wrote down another goal in my life. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7042.6s)]
*  Why? [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7045.92s)]
*  Why would I? [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7048.0s)]
*  I can't control the goals. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7049.8s)]
*  I really believe that. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7051.280000000001s)]
*  Like I learned like, I can control what I can control [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7052.64s)]
*  and that is the work, that is my approach, [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7058.0s)]
*  that is my preparation. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7060.280000000001s)]
*  I can control how I interact with people. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7061.58s)]
*  I had like a couple of blowups in the NBA. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7064.160000000001s)]
*  I joke all the time with like people I'm like, [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7067.04s)]
*  NBA is so competitive and so high stress, [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7070.6s)]
*  everybody should be allowed to blow up. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7074.52s)]
*  What were your blowups? [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7078.64s)]
*  So like, I just remember like a couple of them. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7080.8s)]
*  There was one that I had in Milwaukee [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7083.88s)]
*  and one that I had in my last year with the Clippers [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7086.54s)]
*  and both were with coaches, honestly. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7090.88s)]
*  I don't think I ever had a blowup with a teammate. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7093.120000000001s)]
*  I certainly like certain teammates, [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7095.120000000001s)]
*  we would be direct with each other, [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7097.96s)]
*  but it was never like a blowup. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7101.28s)]
*  To coach in Milwaukee, I was guarding Ben Gordon [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7105.04s)]
*  and they were running a dribble handoff on one side [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7107.879999999999s)]
*  and the big would dribble handoff with him [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7112.48s)]
*  and he turned the corner and it's Ben Gordon. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7114.2s)]
*  I can't go underneath the dribble handoff [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7116.0s)]
*  because he's gonna shoot a three. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7117.599999999999s)]
*  He's got insane shooter. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7118.839999999999s)]
*  So I would chase over the top and obviously I'm chasing. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7120.799999999999s)]
*  So I'm behind him now, the big wasn't providing help [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7123.4s)]
*  and he scored a couple of times on floaters. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7125.44s)]
*  So we go to a timeout and the big was Josh McRoberts [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7127.24s)]
*  who I played with at Duke, insane passer. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7131.5599999999995s)]
*  So they're like top lock him, [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7133.84s)]
*  which means basically get on the high side of him, [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7134.96s)]
*  deny him from coming off the dribble handoff [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7137.2s)]
*  and I said to him, but he's just gonna back door [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7139.36s)]
*  and get a layup. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7141.54s)]
*  Why would I play the defense that way? [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7142.38s)]
*  And that led to one thing to another and I blew up [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7144.48s)]
*  and I regret that, I do regret that. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7146.36s)]
*  And then Brennan O'Connor, [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7148.76s)]
*  who's one of my favorite coaches I've ever had, [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7149.82s)]
*  we tried to implement a defensive coverage [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7153.179999999999s)]
*  against the Pistons mid game that we'd never practiced before. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7156.16s)]
*  And we went over it in film afterwards. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7161.32s)]
*  It didn't work in the game. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7165.36s)]
*  It's actually a good concept [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7167.0s)]
*  that we just never practiced it. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7168.4s)]
*  And so I was kind of like, [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7169.599999999999s)]
*  when you're unsure in the NBA on coverage, [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7171.28s)]
*  you're gonna get fucked. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7173.34s)]
*  You're like the split second you hesitate, you're done. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7174.18s)]
*  So we talked about it in the film session the next day [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7176.5599999999995s)]
*  and I like pushed back a little bit on the coverage [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7178.68s)]
*  and one thing led to another. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7182.76s)]
*  And then he said to me, [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7185.32s)]
*  just shut the fuck up and do your job. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7186.799999999999s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7188.44s)]
*  And that was very hurtful to me. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7189.28s)]
*  Because I'm like, that's all I do is my job. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7191.48s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7194.96s)]
*  And I just, I went ballistic. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7195.799999999999s)]
*  I blacked out, I don't know what I said. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7197.5599999999995s)]
*  And I went and sat on the bus [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7199.12s)]
*  while everybody else shot around for 30 minutes. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7200.04s)]
*  No way. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7201.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7202.5599999999995s)]
*  And have you spoken to the coaches since? [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7204.0s)]
*  Well, Jim, I never really came across again. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7206.5199999999995s)]
*  I would always be friendly with him. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7208.98s)]
*  That was Jim Blaine, not the coach from Chicago, [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7211.679999999999s)]
*  but Jim, who was the older guy. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7213.98s)]
*  And I ended up going to Cleveland with T. Lou. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7216.08s)]
*  It was fine, things happen, it's all good. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7218.08s)]
*  Brendan O'Connor, every time I see him, we joke about it. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7220.04s)]
*  About it? [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7222.88s)]
*  Oh yeah, he calls me bubs [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7223.72s)]
*  because I call everybody bubs because of white chocolate. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7224.76s)]
*  Jason really is the man, dude. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7229.36s)]
*  Who's the best player leader that you played with? [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7231.12s)]
*  Someone in the locker room. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7233.36s)]
*  Can Gio the whole group or you're like, [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7234.8s)]
*  I'll fucking go through a brick wall for this guy. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7236.28s)]
*  So CP was a great leader. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7241.28s)]
*  Really? [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7244.88s)]
*  He had a very direct style of leadership. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7245.72s)]
*  I thought everybody hates him. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7247.0s)]
*  No, he had a very direct style of leadership. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7248.04s)]
*  Okay. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7250.8s)]
*  And so that was. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7251.64s)]
*  That's a nice one. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7253.84s)]
*  He does have that rep. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7254.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7255.64s)]
*  That people don't like playing with him and hate it. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7256.4800000000005s)]
*  Honestly, probably the two best guys, [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7259.2s)]
*  and they were very influential for me for how they led, [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7261.4s)]
*  was early in my career, I had Richard Lewis [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7265.62s)]
*  and I had Jameer Nelson. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7268.08s)]
*  And those guys for me were like the best. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7269.28s)]
*  And what did they do that inspired you? [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7271.4400000000005s)]
*  Jameer was a connector. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7274.76s)]
*  So Jameer was big on team dinners. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7276.52s)]
*  He would have everybody to Philly for a week. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7279.4800000000005s)]
*  He would set up paintball. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7281.38s)]
*  He would set up a Phillies game. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7282.8s)]
*  We'd do batting practice with the Phillies. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7284.12s)]
*  He was just a connector. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7286.360000000001s)]
*  So it was that idea of we're on a team, let's be friends. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7287.84s)]
*  I think it's a very simple thing. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7292.32s)]
*  And we all had that probably in high school, [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7293.96s)]
*  but you don't necessarily have that in the NBA [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7296.2s)]
*  and professional sports. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7298.88s)]
*  So he was a connector. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7299.76s)]
*  But Richard, it's funny because I talked with Ray [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7301.28s)]
*  about this on the podcast, [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7303.96s)]
*  but like Richard learned how to work from Ray. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7305.04s)]
*  I learned how to work from Richard. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7309.639999999999s)]
*  I'll never forget like Richard Lewis, [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7312.48s)]
*  first day he shows up after he signs, [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7314.5599999999995s)]
*  at the time the biggest contractor. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7316.8s)]
*  100 million, seven years. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7318.599999999999s)]
*  Six years, 123 million. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7320.04s)]
*  Keep pocket watching. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7321.84s)]
*  Yeah, we got it. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7322.8s)]
*  It's the only thing we can do. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7324.32s)]
*  No, but he, I'll never forget. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7325.16s)]
*  Like again, I'd been around the league one year [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7327.44s)]
*  and he had that mentality that I talked about [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7332.04s)]
*  like where it's like, it's not like I didn't arrive. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7334.76s)]
*  I didn't make it. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7337.36s)]
*  I still gotta do the work. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7340.2s)]
*  And I'm watching him work out [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7341.84s)]
*  and he's like hour and a half full lather [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7343.92s)]
*  working on every single part of his game. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7346.68s)]
*  Comes back the next day, does it again. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7349.16s)]
*  And that's how he was the whole time I was his teammate. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7350.76s)]
*  It was like a consistency to him. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7353.12s)]
*  And I think the best leaders are consistent. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7355.32s)]
*  The same guy every day. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7358.48s)]
*  The best compliment I ever got as an NBA player. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7359.32s)]
*  And I really mean this. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7361.36s)]
*  Philly, my second year there, [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7363.16s)]
*  Philly wrote an article about, [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7364.48s)]
*  I don't remember the angle of the article, [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7366.12s)]
*  but there was a quote in there from Jimmy. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7368.84s)]
*  And he was like, I love being JJ's teammate [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7370.759999999999s)]
*  because he's the same guy every day. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7373.24s)]
*  And I was like, fuck. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7374.84s)]
*  That's dope. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7376.16s)]
*  It's awesome. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7377.0s)]
*  And it's an incredibly chaotic environment like the NBA. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7377.82s)]
*  Having that consistency is probably amazing. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7379.84s)]
*  You don't know if you're getting traded. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7382.5599999999995s)]
*  You don't know if you're getting minutes. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7383.639999999999s)]
*  You don't know the defense are throwing at you. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7384.679999999999s)]
*  But there's a guy every single day [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7386.24s)]
*  is gonna show up and get to work. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7387.799999999999s)]
*  And that's probably helpful for coach too. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7390.08s)]
*  Jimmy Butler, what makes him different? [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7391.08s)]
*  He was like a not a highly draft player second round, [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7393.08s)]
*  I wanna say. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7395.36s)]
*  And now he's- [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7396.2s)]
*  What makes him different? [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7397.4s)]
*  I mean, watching just his mentality seems different [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7398.88s)]
*  than everyone else's. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7401.48s)]
*  He has a constant chip on his shoulder. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7402.72s)]
*  And he's incredibly intelligent. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7407.04s)]
*  And he has a real like belief in self. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7411.8s)]
*  He has a real belief in self. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7417.8s)]
*  It's like unbreakable. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7420.4800000000005s)]
*  It's unbreakable. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7422.2s)]
*  You mentioned you regret blowing up on those two coaches. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7424.0s)]
*  Do you regret the low blow up you had with Doc? [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7427.08s)]
*  I regret the tone. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7430.16s)]
*  Not anything you said. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7432.56s)]
*  No, what I said is what I believe. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7434.04s)]
*  I don't know how, there's not an agenda with that. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7441.24s)]
*  My job is to comment on the NBA. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7442.76s)]
*  And that's one of the biggest stories [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7444.8s)]
*  in the entire NBA ecosystem this year. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7447.08s)]
*  I was just making a point. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7449.400000000001s)]
*  It's like what had happened since he got the job, [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7450.92s)]
*  even that morning I'm driving him to work [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7454.0s)]
*  and there was something in there about him [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7455.400000000001s)]
*  basically taking credit for the James Harden trade. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7459.280000000001s)]
*  And it was like, I just was like, interesting. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7461.52s)]
*  And then they played the sound and I was like, [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7463.88s)]
*  and then Shannon didn't say anything, [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7465.88s)]
*  Steven A didn't say anything. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7467.52s)]
*  I regret the tone. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7469.360000000001s)]
*  You filled the void. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7470.280000000001s)]
*  The tone seemed too personal and I regret that. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7471.4400000000005s)]
*  And there was no person. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7475.360000000001s)]
*  And Doc, I assume, would get it. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7476.200000000001s)]
*  He was a commentator as well. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7477.320000000001s)]
*  You have to have something to say. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7479.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I've talked to him since. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7480.240000000001s)]
*  It's all good. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7481.400000000001s)]
*  How do you feel about, sorry. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7482.240000000001s)]
*  Well, when do we see you coaching? [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7484.0s)]
*  I know that we gotta wrap this up, [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7485.280000000001s)]
*  but when do we see you coaching? [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7486.96s)]
*  Is that of any interest to you? [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7488.68s)]
*  It is of interest. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7490.72s)]
*  Not putting any timeframe on it. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7493.92s)]
*  But that is something that, given the opportunity, [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7496.72s)]
*  it will happen. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7499.320000000001s)]
*  The one thing I'll say, [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7500.8s)]
*  when I retired, it was very difficult. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7505.52s)]
*  I think for any athlete, [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7508.64s)]
*  you can have a secure sense of self [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7511.400000000001s)]
*  and a secure ego and a secure identity. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7514.84s)]
*  It's inevitable that what you do [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7518.040000000001s)]
*  becomes part of that identity. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7520.76s)]
*  And so letting go of that, [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7522.56s)]
*  I'm not being hyperbolic here. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7524.160000000001s)]
*  It is a fucking death. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7526.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7528.200000000001s)]
*  It is a death. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7529.040000000001s)]
*  It's very hard for me to let go of that. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7530.280000000001s)]
*  And my therapist that I talk to now, [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7532.5199999999995s)]
*  he was very helpful in getting, [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7536.92s)]
*  I knew I wanted to retire. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7538.5199999999995s)]
*  Saying the words, I'm retiring, I'm done. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7540.16s)]
*  I couldn't do it on my own. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7543.5199999999995s)]
*  And so we talked about it. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7545.6s)]
*  It was a very helpful session. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7548.48s)]
*  I was like, okay, I'm ready. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7550.04s)]
*  So I did it. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7551.24s)]
*  Very next session. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7552.08s)]
*  He's like, all right, let's look forward. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7553.76s)]
*  By looking forward, we need to talk about [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7556.24s)]
*  what are the things you loved about playing [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7557.5199999999995s)]
*  that you hope to get in the next phase? [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7560.12s)]
*  And it was competition, performance anxiety, [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7562.8s)]
*  and collaboration, being on a team. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7567.2s)]
*  Fast forward a year, [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7571.04s)]
*  and I realized there was a fourth piece that I loved. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7572.16s)]
*  And it was particularly fulfilling at the end of my career [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7574.48s)]
*  in Philly and New Orleans, and that's leadership. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7578.12s)]
*  And so when I think about coaching, [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7580.96s)]
*  it's like filling all of those things. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7584.92s)]
*  And so I'm not, like coaching to me is about timing, [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7587.36s)]
*  and it's about situation. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7592.36s)]
*  I love what I'm fucking doing right now. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7594.56s)]
*  I'm good, I'm good. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7596.28s)]
*  It's gonna be hard to pull you out of it. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7597.12s)]
*  But the right opportunity, maybe. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7599.04s)]
*  I'm going down the rabbit hole right now in this thing. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7600.96s)]
*  So it's like, I can't be pulled out right now. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7603.16s)]
*  Okay, just tell me real quick, [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7606.4s)]
*  why retirement was so tough [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7608.84s)]
*  and the immediate sensation after you announced it. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7610.92s)]
*  Why it was so tough? [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7616.32s)]
*  Because I just genuinely loved it. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7621.24s)]
*  Like did you stop? [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7626.88s)]
*  My understanding is that you're still doing drills, [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7627.88s)]
*  and you're still working out, you're still getting shots up. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7630.4s)]
*  No. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7632.4s)]
*  That's my understanding is that you may or may not [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7633.24s)]
*  have a key to a gym out east, and you get some shots up. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7637.04s)]
*  No, I'm with my kids. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7641.2s)]
*  That's my understanding is that you've got guys [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7643.92s)]
*  rebounding for you out east, and then you're getting shots. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7646.24s)]
*  I swear, this is what I've heard. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7648.8s)]
*  It's not true, that's not true. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7650.88s)]
*  It's not true, it's not true. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7652.88s)]
*  The most shots I've ever taken at one time in retirement [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7656.4400000000005s)]
*  was like three weeks ago over All Star Break. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7659.52s)]
*  I took my kids to Disney World for the first time, [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7661.96s)]
*  and the hotel had a really nice outdoor court. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7665.76s)]
*  And so that's all they wanted to do. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7669.6s)]
*  Once we got back at like 12, 31 o'clock, [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7670.92s)]
*  the rest of the afternoon they would just play. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7673.0s)]
*  We're up in New York, it's freezing, it's nice out there. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7674.28s)]
*  So they were just like, I want to be outside, [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7676.12s)]
*  I want to play basketball. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7677.16s)]
*  So I'm like, great. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7678.0s)]
*  So the first day, they were on one side of the court [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7678.84s)]
*  because they didn't want to do drills. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7682.4800000000005s)]
*  So I was just like, I'm going to grab a ball, [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7683.92s)]
*  and I started shooting, and I probably took 50 shots. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7685.92s)]
*  I worked my way out to like the NBA line of the NBA line, [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7689.64s)]
*  so just inside half court. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7693.12s)]
*  But I was like shooting jumpers, you know what I mean? [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7694.92s)]
*  Then I woke up the next day and I was like, fuck. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7697.72s)]
*  I'm so sore. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7700.28s)]
*  And I probably took like 50 shots by myself. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7701.5199999999995s)]
*  Like that was it. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7705.5599999999995s)]
*  Wait, sorry, about, you said you want to coach. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7706.5599999999995s)]
*  What player would you most like to coach in today's NBA? [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7708.4s)]
*  Wow. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7711.84s)]
*  Great question. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7712.76s)]
*  Wow. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7713.84s)]
*  I'm going to actually, you know what, [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7715.92s)]
*  I'm going to go with an easy one for me. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7717.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7719.68s)]
*  And hopefully this is non-controversial, [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7721.44s)]
*  but you know, he was my teammate, [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7724.16s)]
*  and he's also one of the best players in the world. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7726.16s)]
*  And to coach in the NBA, [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7728.0s)]
*  you need one of the best players in the world. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7728.96s)]
*  That's Luca. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7730.24s)]
*  I'm from Dallas, that's why I was hoping to say Luca. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7731.08s)]
*  And you know, you didn't actually really play for us, [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7733.0s)]
*  but you know. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7735.0s)]
*  I didn't. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7735.84s)]
*  I didn't. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7736.679999999999s)]
*  I had a fucking partial tear in my Achilles. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7737.5199999999995s)]
*  What do you want me to do? [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7738.88s)]
*  I was saying we could have used you, that's all. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7739.719999999999s)]
*  So does it heal? [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7742.0s)]
*  You just had it heal naturally? [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7743.679999999999s)]
*  No, it's still there. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7745.24s)]
*  So basically I have something called hagglons [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7746.16s)]
*  in my right heel, which is an overgrown heel bone. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7749.12s)]
*  So my heel bone looks like a golf ball. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7751.8s)]
*  And so just through wear and tear playing for so long, [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7753.96s)]
*  the bone started pressing into the Achilles insertion. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7758.2s)]
*  So when I went down to New Orleans that year, [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7763.719999999999s)]
*  it had been bothering me all fall. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7767.0s)]
*  They did like full tendons, scans, knees, [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7768.04s)]
*  ankles, all that stuff. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7770.839999999999s)]
*  And the guy was like, [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7771.96s)]
*  you have a partial tear in your Achilles. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7772.799999999999s)]
*  And so I tried to rehab and I tried to play through it. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7775.04s)]
*  I did PRP in New York over All-Star Break. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7777.24s)]
*  That's right before I got traded to Dallas, [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7779.24s)]
*  which is why I didn't join the team for like a week [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7780.759999999999s)]
*  because I was still rehabbing here. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7782.88s)]
*  And the PRP didn't help. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7784.599999999999s)]
*  And that was part of retirement too, honestly. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7786.16s)]
*  They were like, the surgery is not the same [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7788.28s)]
*  as a full Achilles repair, but it is like four to six months. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7791.76s)]
*  They literally shave your heel bone down. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7794.96s)]
*  And then my bursa sac has inflammation. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7798.2s)]
*  So they clean up the bursa sac and then repair [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7800.24s)]
*  the shredded part of the Achilles. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7802.5599999999995s)]
*  But the Achilles part that's torn. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7804.44s)]
*  That's part of the reason I don't play pickup though. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7806.48s)]
*  Oh really? [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7808.44s)]
*  I'm terrified to tear my Achilles or my calves. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7809.28s)]
*  That's what I was about to say. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7810.8s)]
*  So you can't even play paddle with this. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7811.639999999999s)]
*  Oh, I'm giving you buckets, bro. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7813.48s)]
*  It's a half court, one on one. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7817.16s)]
*  No, I'm not gonna do this to you. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7819.12s)]
*  I've already taken out one guy's ankle. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7820.76s)]
*  Every guy from Duke with a busted foot comes across me [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7823.5199999999995s)]
*  and it's a bad news. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7826.72s)]
*  I mean, disrespectful. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7829.24s)]
*  Guys, I have other work to do. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7831.04s)]
*  I know. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7832.5599999999995s)]
*  How did the pod with LeBron come to fruition? [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7834.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7837.04s)]
*  And is it intimidating to sit across from one of the greats [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7837.88s)]
*  ever in talk the game or do you feel completely comfortable [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7841.599999999999s)]
*  just chopping it? [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7844.12s)]
*  Greats ever in anything. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7844.96s)]
*  It's not intimidating. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7846.8s)]
*  I've known Bron now like 25, 24, 25 years. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7850.24s)]
*  We met when we were like 15 or 16 at USA basketball camp. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7855.88s)]
*  It's funny because I've like never hung out with LeBron. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7860.400000000001s)]
*  Like he's not my boy. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7863.84s)]
*  Oh, I thought you guys were friends [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7865.04s)]
*  and that's how the pod came about. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7866.68s)]
*  We've always had like a mutual respect, great interactions. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7868.0s)]
*  Like it's not like I'm not going on vacation [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7870.96s)]
*  with his family. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7873.08s)]
*  I'm like going over to his house for dinner. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7874.08s)]
*  You don't have a dat with him? [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7876.08s)]
*  No, it's like we just, [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7876.919999999999s)]
*  there's always been a mutual level of respect for as players. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7877.96s)]
*  I mean, like, and so we saw each other in December [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7882.36s)]
*  with the folks on his side and just had a conversation [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7888.48s)]
*  and that kind of just got the ball rolling. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7892.48s)]
*  So he picked you or you picked him? [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7894.08s)]
*  Can't say. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7898.4s)]
*  There's no good answer to that. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7899.48s)]
*  Really? [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7901.679999999999s)]
*  Seems like there's a great answer. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7902.879999999999s)]
*  Okay, so this thing comes together. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7906.08s)]
*  The first episode, we've seen the first episode [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7910.12s)]
*  which is actually half of what has been filmed. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7912.04s)]
*  So there's another episode coming out. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7914.36s)]
*  The first episode, do you know you have a hit? [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7916.599999999999s)]
*  Like when 15, 20 minutes into the conversation, [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7918.879999999999s)]
*  you're going, oh, this is the most fun [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7921.48s)]
*  and this is gonna be crazy or okay, immediately. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7923.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, immediately. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7926.599999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7927.639999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7928.48s)]
*  And by the way, the second episodes, like, [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7929.32s)]
*  so we recorded, the plan is to sort of record [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7930.44s)]
*  two episodes at a time. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7933.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7934.6s)]
*  The second part of the conversation was the part [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7936.120000000001s)]
*  where like you're in the room and you're like floating. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7938.72s)]
*  Because it's so pure. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7941.56s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7942.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7943.72s)]
*  And it's funny, Jason Gallagher, [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7944.56s)]
*  who's our head of production and has been with us [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7946.84s)]
*  since day one on The Old Man and the Three, [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7950.4800000000005s)]
*  since we started this company, [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7952.160000000001s)]
*  he's listened to fucking, I don't even know now, [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7953.6s)]
*  220 episodes of The Old Man and the Three [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7955.52s)]
*  plus all the shit we do for Draft Kings. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7958.76s)]
*  He's been in every conversation [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7961.72s)]
*  and he texts me afterwards and he's like, [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7964.2s)]
*  dude, he's like, I was floating today. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7965.84s)]
*  That's the best shit you've ever recorded. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7968.639999999999s)]
*  It was in me. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7970.44s)]
*  No, it was fire. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7971.28s)]
*  Yeah, I was like. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7972.12s)]
*  So by the time this is out, [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7972.96s)]
*  episode two will most likely be out. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7973.8s)]
*  Yeah, it'll be out. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7976.12s)]
*  And you listen on all this in platforms, [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7976.96s)]
*  but I would watch the YouTube video. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7978.5199999999995s)]
*  The YouTube video I think is the most instructive. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7980.36s)]
*  I think you need to see the graphics [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7982.5599999999995s)]
*  to understand what you guys are talking about. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7984.16s)]
*  And I like how you're not watering it down. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7985.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7987.4s)]
*  I love that. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7988.24s)]
*  Like, raise the level of intellect of the audience. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7989.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7990.76s)]
*  Is there anything that surprised you hanging with him? [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7991.599999999999s)]
*  Like you guys hadn't hung out a ton before, [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7993.0s)]
*  but now you guys are face to face talking about the game. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7995.04s)]
*  Is there anything that surprised you [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7997.16s)]
*  about the way you dissect him? [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7998.0s)]
*  Well, I had the dinner with him in December. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=7998.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8000.0s)]
*  Is there anything the way he dissects the game [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8001.32s)]
*  that surprised you? [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8002.76s)]
*  No, nothing surprised me. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8004.16s)]
*  I think what is interesting is, [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8005.56s)]
*  we typically have seen LeBron in a press conference, [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8008.72s)]
*  right, when he's talking. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8013.12s)]
*  And to get him in that setting, [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8014.96s)]
*  it's just like, he's awesome. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8017.6s)]
*  Like, he's awesome at it. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8020.44s)]
*  Yeah, you're both. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8022.08s)]
*  I think you're both excellent. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8023.84s)]
*  And yeah, you guys don't have to explain yourself. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8024.68s)]
*  When you talk to us about basketball, you have to, [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8027.68s)]
*  it's the same thing if we're gonna talk like [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8030.12s)]
*  com mates, anybody. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8031.28s)]
*  Like, we have to kind of dumb down what we're saying. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8032.12s)]
*  You're talking to someone who knows [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8034.56s)]
*  exactly what you're talking about, [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8036.04s)]
*  probably specific plays. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8037.36s)]
*  You can reference a play of his from some playoff game [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8039.2s)]
*  that you are watching and he knows the exact play. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8042.0s)]
*  There's way less fluff. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8044.56s)]
*  And it's really, I think you're gonna see a lot more of this [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8046.4s)]
*  in not just basketball, but all avenues. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8051.36s)]
*  Change the trajectory. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8054.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8055.44s)]
*  By the way, there's nothing wrong with the sugar. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8056.28s)]
*  I wanna be, like, I was talking about it earlier. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8058.24s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with the sugar. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8059.88s)]
*  There's nothing, absolutely nothing wrong with that. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8061.0s)]
*  I'm not against the sugar. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8063.5599999999995s)]
*  I like sugar too. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8064.759999999999s)]
*  I'm on Twitter, like, I like the sugar. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8066.04s)]
*  Sugar's fun sometimes. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8068.4s)]
*  But this is sugar for people who love basketball. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8069.4s)]
*  Sometimes too much sugar becomes toxic. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8071.639999999999s)]
*  Right, well said. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8073.599999999999s)]
*  What are we talking about now? [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8075.599999999999s)]
*  Just like, sub-super entertainers. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8077.24s)]
*  Commentators that are super-entertained. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8079.04s)]
*  Guys who are sports-entertainers, [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8081.04s)]
*  like I'm a sports-entertainer. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8081.88s)]
*  Where you're just kinda watching and just saying things. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8082.72s)]
*  But that's awesome too. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8084.76s)]
*  It's entertaining. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8085.599999999999s)]
*  It's so fun. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8086.44s)]
*  Like, you look at a guy. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8087.28s)]
*  It's amazing. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8088.8s)]
*  I work with Stephen A. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8089.639999999999s)]
*  I was about to say, he's incredible. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8090.679999999999s)]
*  He's amazing. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8092.36s)]
*  And you want that, I want that. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8093.2s)]
*  Sometimes I just wanna hear crazy hot takes. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8094.5199999999995s)]

*  Who gives a fuck? [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8098.04s)]
*  I enjoy that as well. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8098.88s)]
*  But there is a time and place when you see people [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8100.36s)]
*  who are obsessed with a thing. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8103.28s)]
*  It doesn't have to be basketball. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8105.04s)]
*  It can be two nerds talking about robots. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8106.28s)]
*  But they're obsessed with a thing [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8108.36s)]
*  and they're just talking to each other about that thing [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8109.72s)]
*  and they don't care who's listening [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8111.88s)]
*  and that's what it feels like. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8113.0s)]
*  It doesn't feel like you guys care who's listening. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8114.320000000001s)]
*  And because of that, I wanna listen. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8116.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8118.52s)]

*  about himself? [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8124.88s)]
*  No. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8125.72s)]
*  I am feeling it. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8126.56s)]

*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8130.240000000001s)]
*  I know, but. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8131.08s)]

*  I think the other thing, like, [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8132.76s)]
*  you know, there's an element of [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8134.0s)]
*  what has become not only the take industry, [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8138.48s)]
*  but the second take industry. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8144.16s)]
*  Everybody's chasing? [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8146.4s)]
*  No, no, no, no, meaning like the reaction to the take. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8147.959999999999s)]
*  Oh, it's all. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8151.639999999999s)]
*  That's like, and then there's the reaction [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8152.48s)]
*  to the reaction. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8154.759999999999s)]
*  Bro, that's all YouTube is becoming. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8155.599999999999s)]
*  I don't want this to be reactionary. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8157.32s)]
*  Certainly we'll react to what's happening [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8159.919999999999s)]
*  on the basketball court. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8161.4s)]

*  It will be reacted to. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8166.44s)]
*  But you want to create the source. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8168.4s)]
*  The source material is always better to create [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8170.28s)]
*  than reacting to the thing or reacting to the reaction. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8172.32s)]
*  It's just like basketball. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8175.0s)]
*  Like outside of my kids and my wife, [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_QQ6A_xNc&t=8176.84s)]
