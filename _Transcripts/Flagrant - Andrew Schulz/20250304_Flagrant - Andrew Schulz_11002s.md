*  Yes, like let's be honest if you saw two passports at the airport and one was the American one and then the other one was [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=160.18s)]
*  Like magenta, whatever colors the other people's yeah, which one are you taking? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=166.1s)]

*  Don't even know about what Greenland the way they're [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=216.54s)]
*  Okay, but the way they're acting I did want to give them the opportunity to be American [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=219.42000000000002s)]
*  Oh really the fact that I don't see a lot of like tweets on like Greenland Twitter or whatever like that [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=222.86s)]
*  I need to see more excitement. Why not? I mean they wore their MAGA hats for Trump jr. How do they really well? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=227.5s)]
*  I mean there's controversy around it. Why not? Well, cuz they're saying that they rounded up a bunch of homeless Greenlanders and gave them [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=232.98000000000002s)]
*  Greenlanders that's what I was saying. I'm saying there's only 50,000 of you. Yeah, it's a huge place [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=241.46s)]
*  We're gonna give a quarter pound of whale blubber to anybody [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=246.46s)]
*  Okay, you can cut it open with that little [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=251.18s)]

*  Yeah, that looks like he looks like a daggers thing you wrestling [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=272.14s)]
*  Anyway, listen we got a lot. Well, what no what else we got? We got a doge. We don't explain doge. Sure [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=275.46s)]
*  Oh, you're the expert on doge. Apparently. Yeah. Yeah, you're apparently on the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=282.58s)]
*  Actually, I have no fucking clue what's going on. I really have no clue but you came in today [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=287.09999999999997s)]
*  Like I think you what did you say? What did I say that? I'm going over you are going viral [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=292.26s)]
*  Yes, you're you and Charlamagne's back and forth on doge has been I've seen it everywhere [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=296.5s)]
*  My algorithm we're the top political analyst [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=301.86s)]
*  But when people want to know what's happening in America journalists, you're the top political commentator [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=306.18s)]
*  Like a polymorph, you know, yeah, yeah, you and Charlamagne are kind of breaking points, you know, yeah. Yeah, that's right [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=314.26s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's the same concept. That's true. It's the same concept. Whoa, I'm liking it. Yeah, dude. Did you steal our? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=320.14s)]
*  I think I did. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=326.65999999999997s)]
*  You're just brilliant brilliance [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=329.62s)]
*  Okay, and then we got more like there's a bunch of things that you are absolutely perfect to explain to us [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=332.06s)]
*  Oh the gold card citizenship. Oh, yeah [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=337.97999999999996s)]
*  I want to know like why Steve Bannon's back around like I just want to know all these things [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=339.97999999999996s)]
*  So where do we want to start? Obviously, the Zelinsky thing is the biggest. Yeah. Did you watch the whole I watched the whole thing [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=345.53999999999996s)]
*  Can you give us your honest breakdown of it? Sure [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=350.82s)]
*  I mean I well, let me disclose my bias. I've been very [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=353.46s)]
*  I've been very against more a to Ukraine been for a settled, you know a settlement of the conflict now quite some time [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=357.06s)]
*  So my bias like totally upfront and so seeing that all happened was very like very pleasing to me [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=363.14s)]
*  I'll try and be just like neutral. So it was a 53 minute interaction [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=369.7s)]
*  It was during something called a pool spray, which is so I used to cover the White House [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=373.41999999999996s)]
*  You give the way that these things usually work is you have the King chairs where Trump was in that chair and you have a Zelensky [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=377.5s)]
*  Here, it's like the head of state chair. We usually the camera [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=382.74s)]
*  So like if you and I were sitting the people who are watching there's be a wall of cameras right here [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=385.66s)]
*  And it's supposed to just be diplomatic fineries. It's supposed to just be like yes, mr. President [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=389.66s)]
*  We welcome you to our country blah blah blah for about 40 minutes. It mostly was totally chill [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=393.42s)]
*  It even Trump was like you guys have been very brave if you watch a lot of this [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=399.26s)]
*  He was very much trying to keep things under control [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=403.34000000000003s)]
*  But there was this moment and what happened is that is that? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=406.06s)]
*  Zelensky hates JD Vance for a variety of reasons well back when JD was a Senate candidate [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=409.94s)]
*  So 2022 had a viral moment where he was like, I don't care about Ukraine at all [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=415.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, he said that on camera became a huge controversy obviously became a villain inside Ukraine [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=419.62s)]
*  But he's also been kind of a chief opponent of more military aid to Ukraine or what I would call is like the Atlantic religion [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=424.5s)]
*  like this idea that the United States and Europe are [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=430.35999999999996s)]
*  Inextricably linked that the invasion of Ukraine is not only an attack on democracy [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=434.09999999999997s)]
*  It's an attack on America itself. So that's kind of the Euro centric Atlantic mindset very Cold War mentality [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=437.98s)]
*  God, all right [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=444.62s)]
*  So Vance is somebody who's much more of a realist like he thinks that there are checks and balances and that stockpiles are mine are [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=445.34s)]
*  Our actual trade-offs, right? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=452.42s)]
*  So he's like we can't just ship unlimited weapons to Ukraine because we have to worry about our own stuff [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=454.54s)]
*  We need to worry about Taiwan or we need to worry about any other out pretty reasonable [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=458.65999999999997s)]
*  I would say it's quite reasonable, but you know, that's that they would say otherwise and that's fine [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=462.02s)]
*  It's a democracy. But anyway, so put that all together [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=466.20000000000005s)]
*  JD I think was making a statement about bringing peace and it was at that moment that [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=469.6s)]
*  Zelensky really you could see him lean forward the way I am right now and he's like, let me ask you question JD [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=474.76000000000005s)]
*  And that's when I was like, oh shit because well, first of all JD was calling him. Mr. President. He's calling him JD [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=480.8s)]
*  He's got a lot of hatred there. Don't forget either [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=486.12s)]
*  Zelensky came to [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=488.96000000000004s)]
*  Pennsylvania and [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=491.0s)]
*  For Josh Shapiro, yeah, not only that he gave an interview here on US soil attacking JD Vance saying I forget you might be able to [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=493.0s)]
*  Find it mark. He either said he was too radical or something like that. So Zelensky's had it out for JD for a long time [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=500.24s)]
*  I love your comfort [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=505.36s)]
*  State [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=516.56s)]
*  So that low-caste [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=523.16s)]
*  He's too radical there it is [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=531.52s)]
*  Over Zelensky calls Vance too radical suggests that he needs to study World War two [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=539.48s)]
*  Yeah [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=543.88s)]
*  So that was September that was right before the election and they start bickering basically over the terms of the 2014 [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=544.12s)]
*  Ceasefire and it was then that this all starts to get very very contentious. Can I ask a real quick question? Yeah [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=550.88s)]
*  But this whole meeting was this to present the agreement on the ceasefire. Is that the idea? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=558.04s)]
*  Well, there's no ceasefire yet. So it's called the minerals deal [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=564.64s)]
*  So over the last one say couple of weeks or so the Secretary of the Treasury Scott Besson went to Kiev [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=567.5s)]
*  Basically to negotiate this long-term minerals deal the terms of the deal or it's kind of complicated [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=573.56s)]
*  But like basically it would give the United States rights to Ukrainian rare earth minerals and US companies would effectively have a monopoly over that [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=578.92s)]
*  in exchange [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=586.28s)]
*  There would be a interest from the United States in a free and a sovereign Ukraine that would not be attacked now [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=587.3199999999999s)]
*  Zelensky wants something called an explicit security guarantee. So if you attack us we start we start bombing you exactly [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=594.0799999999999s)]
*  So he wants his full-blown NATO membership [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=600.7199999999999s)]
*  That's not gonna happen because it would mean article 5 get triggered that would obviously bring the United States [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=603.0s)]
*  Into a nuclear war he's willing to settle of course settle for an explicit US guarantee over what I think Ukraine controls now [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=608.0400000000001s)]
*  Although he's never even said that that would be a concession for him. So this was supposed to be a meeting of fineries [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=615.44s)]
*  We're like, yep. We're here. We're here to work together. We're here to work towards peace [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=621.28s)]
*  Zelensky just loses it over a couple of things one was Trump being like this guy can't even [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=624.76s)]
*  Say anything about peace with Putin which you know, I mean, let's give Zelensky the benefit of the doubt and all this [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=631.0400000000001s)]
*  Country's been invaded. He's been at war as people are being killed [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=636.4599999999999s)]
*  So that's probably a lot to swallow [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=639.06s)]
*  But the thing is is that from a pure diplomatic point of view [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=640.62s)]
*  Yeah, there's a there's a template for all of this the king of Jordan was here two weeks ago [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=644.14s)]
*  Him and Trump are huge differences over Gaza, right Trump controlling Gaza and Trump says all this. Oh, we're gonna control Gaza [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=648.86s)]
*  Yeah, Jordan, they're gonna give it. I mean that's from Gaza. I deep post was look. It was wild [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=655.4599999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=659.5s)]
*  Even the guys with the women with beards, yes [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=662.26s)]
*  Beards, I think we're great. It's a very progressive Gaza. That's right [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=664.82s)]
*  God's got woke. Maybe that's why they cover him up [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=668.18s)]
*  Okay, all right. So what happened but the king sits there, you know, it's all diplomatic fine [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=672.22s)]
*  And then afterwards he releases a saving we had great discussions, but and he just lays out his terms [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=676.94s)]
*  So that's a idea of contentious meeting US ally, but Jordan, you know at the end of the day [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=681.38s)]
*  Receiving a shit ton of USAID where the major guarantor of their security Zelensky just can't take it and he breaks down [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=686.06s)]
*  So you can even see his posture [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=692.42s)]
*  He starts going at JD both over a ceasefire and he starts questioning basic facts [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=694.5799999999999s)]
*  So the set the fact that really set Zelensky off is when JD said you are pressing your own male population [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=700.06s)]
*  Into forced conscription because you don't have enough manpower on the front lines [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=707.5s)]
*  That is an objective fact the average age of the Ukrainian military is somewhere between 40 and 50 years old which is insane [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=711.9s)]
*  That's like late-stage Nazi Germany fighting in World War two [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=718.42s)]
*  That's the Civil War the Confederate military the Confederate Armed Forces at the siege of Petersburg left [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=721.74s)]
*  But that's actually a key point remember. Yeah, the Ukrainians refused to drop their draft age from I think it's 25 or 27 [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=728.8199999999999s)]
*  There's a whole generation of 18 to 25 year olds or 27 that are not currently eligible for the Ukrainian draft and it's because it's massively [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=736.86s)]
*  unpopular in Ukraine so out of both sides of their mouth, they're like we're total war [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=744.86s)]
*  We're throwing everything we got this on the other side. They're like, well, we're also preserving our prime-age male population to repopulate [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=749.3000000000001s)]
*  The Ukrainian state in the future [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=755.46s)]
*  So they're not really throwing everything that they do have here [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=757.54s)]
*  And in fact previously one of the US demands was hey you guys gotta drop your fucking draft age down to 18 [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=760.4200000000001s)]
*  The reason they don't want to do that is a the guys don't want to fight because they've watched probably a million or so [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=765.54s)]
*  People get killed is B. They're just gonna flee [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=769.9s)]
*  I mean if you guys go so I was in Hungary and in Budapest my guide [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=772.2199999999999s)]
*  We walked past the Four Seasons hotel and he's like you see all these license plates [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=776.9399999999999s)]
*  It was like Ukraine Ukraine Ukraine Ukraine Ukraine. These are all filthy rich Ukrainians who've been living in the Four Seasons [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=780.8399999999999s)]
*  Gresham Palace in [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=787.62s)]
*  Hungary until I go to Vienna and same thing my guide is like our strip clubs have never had better business [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=789.5s)]
*  They've been just throw it like these Ukrainians have been throwing money around so they don't want to fight [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=797.1s)]
*  I mean a huge portion of their population is gone [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=802.7s)]
*  So there's all of that came to head when JD was like you're forcibly conscripting people empirically true [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=805.38s)]
*  There are videos of people dude, sadly even people who are mentally retarded who have been pressed into service strong [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=811.0600000000001s)]
*  It's horrible, it's but I mean they can probably know you can also look at the [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=817.2s)]
*  What is a coach do [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=832.56s)]

*  Let's get back to the show. Thank you all so much. Bye. So the feeling or the sentiment is Elise online that the [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=892.72s)]
*  Population is fractured in terms of their support of the war. Yes, which is not uncommon [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=899.14s)]
*  More I'm in America Vietnam, right? It was probably divided even in an invasion [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=903.6s)]
*  You have to remember this is a country which as a polity like was very torn apart [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=908.6s)]
*  Like it is significant portion of their population which spoke Russian had affinity for Russia [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=913.2s)]
*  That's largely part that Russia kind of controls. Yeah, right now best [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=918.72s)]
*  But then you also have that yeah the Donbas region, you're right the Donetsk, but also you have this new Ukrainian [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=921.78s)]
*  identity, which has really [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=928.12s)]
*  Emerged a very distinct from how it used to be in the Soviet times and others. So anyway, it's [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=930.36s)]
*  No, I'm never been to Ukraine. I've been to all around Ukraine, but never actually Ukraine is awesome. Like Kiev is awesome [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=936.16s)]
*  Yeah, we went we went during the last war [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=942.08s)]
*  Which one the Crimea? Oh, okay [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=945.52s)]
*  2013 [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=948.6s)]
*  But it was like we I got like I knew someone was up because I got an email from Expedia and they were like [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=950.8s)]
*  by the way [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=956.5600000000001s)]
*  It was something like [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=958.64s)]
*  It was a would you like to rent a car for your trip? By the way, this is an active war zone. Be safe [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=960.68s)]
*  It was unbelievable food was amazing [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=969.9599999999999s)]
*  The food was incredible [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=974.64s)]
*  Yeah, I don't prostitutes were just so [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=977.64s)]
*  Incredible like the girl I saw that's another sad part of it [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=981.68s)]
*  Just the number of Ukrainian women who are apparently are being human trafficked all over Europe apparently [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=984.8s)]
*  It's a disaster like all over Hungary, Vienna all in terms of prostitution. They're being totally [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=989.92s)]
*  That's fucking horrible [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1006.24s)]
*  How fucking miserable those people in those countries they're going to [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1009.68s)]
*  Be furious [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1014.72s)]
*  So it seems like there's waning support [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1037.28s)]
*  Oh [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1044.64s)]
*  Or they want to leave no, so I think an orgasm it's a problem [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1046.88s)]
*  Cuz I had sex once and then my boy had a girl that he had sex and then he went back for number two [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1053.88s)]
*  And I'm just sitting on the couch with this poor girl. I want her [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1058.8000000000002s)]
*  So I take her back and I got the udon noodle. My shit is not even close to [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1061.68s)]
*  I just I just kind of pumped away for a little bit and then I was like [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1067.24s)]
*  ceasefire [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1071.68s)]
*  Fire [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1074.64s)]
*  Seespire Ukrainians can support exactly. Yeah. Okay, so you were saying okay, so in this meeting also been to Russian strippers [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1077.6000000000001s)]
*  I didn't do anything didn't touch them at all. Right just want to let you know. Yeah. Well, you probably should you should I wouldn't [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1086.64s)]
*  All right [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1091.6000000000001s)]
*  So what we have in this meeting is not only all of this beef around conscription [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1091.92s)]
*  But really what happened is that Vance started to get very frustrated and he was like you come here to the Oval Office of the [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1097.0400000000002s)]
*  United States you disrespect this office. Yeah, the worst mistake Zelensky made is that as Trump is getting furious this Zelensky [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1102.64s)]
*  This is the line. This was the lie [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1110.0s)]
*  You have no cards you have you remember this the line to me was the line to me that ended it. Yeah was um [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1112.16s)]
*  You don't have to worry now, but you know future you have a notion [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1120.48s)]
*  So you don't have to worry now, but in the future you will worry or something like that [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1124.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. He was like don't tell us what to be afraid of [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1126.96s)]
*  I mean that's this is trump like trump is not only transaction [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1129.28s)]
*  It's about respect apparently they told Zelensky to wear a suit before he came and he did where he decided not to [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1132.88s)]
*  He's an actor. He's did you see yeah, he goes [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1138.64s)]
*  What do you say? He's like you dressed up. Yeah, that's fantastic [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1141.8400000000001s)]
*  But that line to me is where he lost everything. Absolutely because you're threatening you're basically he's basically acting [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1144.96s)]
*  He's been acting this way for three years. That's the shocking part of it is he has this false [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1151.04s)]
*  Look, I mean this is where i'm gonna put my own bias on the table [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1155.6s)]
*  Let's look at all of the arguments for supporting ukraine. Number one is that we need to defend nato and you're like, okay [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1158.1599999999999s)]
*  Well ukrainians are or ukrainians not in nato. Okay, got it, too. We need to defend democracy [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1165.4399999999998s)]
*  It's like yeah [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1170.9599999999998s)]
*  I mean it's a democracy in the way that any corrupt eastern european country is linsky's cancelled elections their parliament or their constitution says [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1171.52s)]
*  They can't even hold an election during wartime. He has banned opposition parties censored the media [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1178.32s)]
*  I mean doesn't look that democratic to me [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1183.52s)]
*  And actually one of the core demands of the united states is like hey you need to hold an election and he's like no [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1186.24s)]
*  We can't do that. We can't have that until even in his [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1189.92s)]
*  Even in his interview on fox news afterwards, they're like, would you resign? He's like that is up to ukrainians [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1193.92s)]
*  I'm like how they can't vote dude. Yeah, it's like how does that work? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1200.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, three was okay [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1203.28s)]
*  And this is the most sinister and the disgusting one is well, we need to support ukraine because we're weakening russia [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1204.8s)]
*  Which means what which is that we are forcing the russians to pour millions of men into ukraine and kill as many russians as possible [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1210.64s)]
*  And somehow that's in the national interest of the united states is that we're weakening russia and we're making their economy poorer [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1218.4s)]
*  Here's the thing russia's not like here. It's also not a democracy [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1225.2800000000002s)]
*  In a sense, they don't give a shit about a million guys who get killed go look at their history [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1229.2s)]
*  What always happens the war is a disaster. It's a total shit show. They make up for it with the vast, you know [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1234.0800000000002s)]
*  Population that they have they pour as many people in there very inefficiently to kill a shit ton [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1240.3s)]
*  And for some reason the population, I mean they don't love it, but they're not rioting in the streets in the way that [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1245.28s)]
*  In america, it's like dude. It's part of their lore like in the soviet union [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1251.52s)]
*  They lost almost 20 percent of their population. That's a foundational myth of their country [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1255.2s)]
*  We went to russia as well. We did comedy and we did comedy in russia. Not what actually must be hard what we did in ukraine and [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1260.4s)]
*  So basically [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1267.04s)]
*  When I was asking them about this and I think that what they have [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1268.3999999999999s)]
*  Culturally is a lower expectation of happiness. Absolutely. You're absolutely right [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1272.86s)]
*  And the advantage of that is there's like a suffering built into the yes, it's in their story [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1277.6s)]
*  Yeah, like their story going back to the 1600s [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1282.32s)]
*  It's just invasion is projection all of russian national security policy all the way back to the time of the czars is what? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1284.6399999999999s)]
*  Defense through depth is vastness. Yeah our population we conquer as much as we can force the population to come through [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1291.1999999999998s)]
*  I mean they've had horrible episodes [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1297.9199999999998s)]
*  They were conquered by the mongols that went through and devastated all the way up to kiev [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1299.1999999999998s)]
*  I mean obviously invaded by the nazis invaded by napoleon their strength is their vastness is their population and their just [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1303.84s)]
*  capacity for suffering the Chinese have very similar capacity for suffering. Yes, absolutely built into the culture. It's built into their literature [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1311.4399999999998s)]
*  There is this understanding that one does suffer absolutely one of and something very powerful about that [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1319.06s)]
*  I think this is something that like americans maybe do not have right not at all since we haven't seen more on our front lines [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1324.18s)]
*  And i'm talking about actual war since the civil war. Oh, yeah, that's the closest we ever came and remember [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1331.38s)]
*  What was that? 2 of the u.s population was killed remember they got 20 of their population that was killed [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1335.94s)]
*  They had general orders during stalin the not one step back policy [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1341.06s)]
*  Stalin's son was captured and he threw his daughter-in-law in prison [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1345.3s)]
*  Because they said any person who gets captured your whole family is going to the gulag [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1350.26s)]
*  That is the dna now. I don't know i don't know if this is like a benefit to this but [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1355.54s)]
*  What happens when 20 of your population dies and it's men? [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1360.34s)]
*  Yeah, is that any man that's alive is like an absolutely has six women? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1363.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's right [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1369.06s)]
*  And this is why there was no standard for like not being an alcoholic or not being a piece of shit like [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1369.94s)]
*  That's true. And literally because if you had a cock that worked that was the only way to continue procreating [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1375.54s)]
*  And I spoke to a guy who was like taking us around ukraine [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1380.74s)]
*  He was like essentially our fixer right there and he was and that's what he does [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1383.22s)]
*  He like takes people around these places where you might feel a little uncomfortable and he's like [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1386.42s)]
*  Yeah, there was a time where like six is an understatement you could have 12 different girls [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1390.3400000000001s)]
*  If you had a job you could pay the bills and you could feed them and the girls had to kind of put up with it [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1394.3400000000001s)]
*  Now they get upset with that. So what happens when they get upset about there is a sexual revolution because you have to compete for the guy [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1399.94s)]
*  You're not in the position to be like, you know, i'm keeping my pussy tight because seven other girls are like i'll open it up for whatever [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1407.46s)]
*  So now you have it's like yeah 20 the guys die, but the guys who are alive are like it's party time [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1413.7s)]
*  Not even 20 percent of the guys [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1420.98s)]
*  Probably only women right? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1423.46s)]
*  They just lived through the worst conflict [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1425.46s)]
*  I actually read a book about what moscow was like when they thought the nazis were about to come [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1427.46s)]
*  And it was the most debauchery [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1432.66s)]
*  Like party that the moscow apparently had ever seen like people were just housing vodka like having sex in stairwells [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1435.46s)]
*  And they were right. They were excited. They were they were there was just like this is it [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1442.9s)]
*  If they're about to die, we're all about to die. And so they just it was crazy, man [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1446.5s)]
*  It's the same way if you read about how our guys behaved in london the airmen, uh in world war II [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1451.54s)]
*  You're like yo, dude. This is this is disgusting [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1457.22s)]
*  You're like this this is bad man [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1460.42s)]
*  Like the us army's like trying to find prophylactic [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1462.5s)]
*  Kits that will actually work the entire piccadilly circus was a literal whorehouse for us soldiers [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1466.1000000000001s)]
*  Do they have this is part of the world war two [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1472.98s)]
*  Okay [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1482.02s)]
*  Soldiers were paid five times the wage of a british soldier at the time the guys had no chance [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1502.9s)]
*  The brits were furious about it. They're like our invasion is here of these yanks [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1508.5s)]
*  They're over sexed overpaid and over here that was like [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1515.0600000000002s)]
*  All my family was over there at that time [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1520.98s)]
*  Wait you said nisha doesn't care about losing people but why did they don't hear as much as much [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1526.5s)]
*  Why did they recruit? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1530.3400000000001s)]
*  North koreans to fight for well, uh, that's actually an interesting thing [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1531.54s)]
*  So first I think the north koreans want battle experience because they have one of the world's largest militaries [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1534.34s)]
*  But two is the north koreans have tons of ammunition. They have a stockpile and actually this is a useful thing for geopolitics [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1538.8999999999999s)]
*  I saw a tweet today. They're like why are the world take russia seriously like smaller gdp than texas [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1545.9399999999998s)]
*  You know all of this and I was like, uh, the answer is like 9 000 nuclear weapons [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1552.98s)]
*  It's like the same thing with north korea [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1556.58s)]
*  I don't even know what the north korean gdp is like probably a county in and that's a little mississippi [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1558.02s)]
*  Yeah, you know like it's nuclear weapons and natural resources [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1563.54s)]
*  Yeah, of course because if you just have one you can't really compete on the global stage [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1566.34s)]
*  Yeah, but when you have nuclear weapons and you have oil and gas, of course, no one could really tell you what to do [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1570.1s)]
*  Bro, I was in uh, istanbul. Yes, and uh, I saw the russian oil chips ships coming through because they have to go through that [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1574.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. What is that little? Uh, straight? Bosphorus bosphorus. Yeah, I think that's what it is [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1582.02s)]
*  And they basically took away the russian lettering on the side of ships, right? [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1585.78s)]
*  So that's like remember there's like an oil embargo nobody's gonna buy russian oil totables [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1589.94s)]
*  They just painted over the side of the ships and then russian oil became well [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1594.18s)]
*  This is a very useful exercise in like how power works [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1597.22s)]
*  So america like our economy doesn't do we don't produce anything. We're a service-based economy [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1600.02s)]
*  So we were like, oh well, we're cut the russians off from here and we're gonna fuck them over and it's like [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1605.46s)]
*  Oh russian gdp is exploding their war production is incredible [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1610.34s)]
*  They've increased year over year their gdp is expanding or their economy is expanding because of war production [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1614.02s)]
*  We tried to care in them. We cancelled. No. Yeah, we're like don't you dare do business with russia? [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1619.54s)]
*  That's right. We went woke and they made a lot of money [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1623.86s)]
*  And they made a share of the money and actually the european union has spent more in year three [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1626.8999999999999s)]
*  Just on russian oil than they have given to ukraine. So there's a lot of talking [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1631.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's out of all sides of their mouth [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1634.42s)]
*  But this is a very less useful lesson for america guns bullets oil. That's the only shit that matters [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1635.94s)]
*  That's all that matters. Oh and video stock or it's bullshit. It's nothing [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1640.74s)]
*  You already know [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1645.3799999999999s)]
*  This market actually I don't think it's gonna hold me we need this market to hold some bad signs on the horizon [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1650.5s)]
*  That's interesting. Yeah, what's happening? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1656.5s)]
*  What's the s&p 500? Oh, I don't think it's good. It's been dropping like 1.5 [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1659.46s)]
*  Yeah, but this year's so big earnings and they have a new check that's gonna get really well actually [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1663.54s)]
*  But there's a lot of bitcoin I need to buy it back. I lost a lot of bitcoin [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1666.82s)]
*  And it's flat on the month, which is not great, but it's been dropping a little bit from yeah [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1670.42s)]
*  There's some signs that looks like yes. I mean don't get me wrong. It's like we're still doing fine [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1674.58s)]
*  I have a my guy and I was like are we selling say again cryptos in the tank? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1678.5s)]
*  Yeah, cryptos in that guy, but not really though. It's like when bitcoin crashes from 100 to 80 [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1682.66s)]
*  You're like, come on bro, like you know what I mean? It's like it like two months. That's kind of crazy [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1686.74s)]
*  Okay, sure, but i'm not saying okay [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1691.14s)]
*  It's like what does crash mean like and this is also where we should be honest about the s&p where it's like [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1693.3000000000002s)]
*  Look, it's still up 20 on the don't even talk about s&p. Just talk about nvidia [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1698.74s)]
*  Like you gotta speak about nvidia. What is nvidia right now? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1702.5800000000002s)]
*  You gotta speak about it in the same way as bitcoin then sure yeah, absolutely [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1705.78s)]
*  If you're gonna look at that exponential growth over the past decade [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1709.3799999999999s)]
*  I'm i'm saying in terms of like national character like for example [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1712.6599999999999s)]
*  I've been thinking a lot about this with cars with look american cars [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1716.26s)]
*  Like if we're being honest and if we had a totally free market i'm buying a chinese ev yesterday [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1720.1s)]
*  Wait, like are you kidding me? They're incredible. There's this guy forest forest auto reviews. He's so good [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1725.22s)]
*  He does all these videos showing byd the xiaomi cars [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1731.62s)]
*  The byd just rolled out full self driving for even their car that costs fucking ten thousand dollars [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1735.3s)]
*  Like if you buy a tesla fsd will cost you an extra no, no, no [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1739.94s)]
*  I don't want these to be sold here. I don't want them to be sold here [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1745.46s)]
*  But that's my point is that we have to recognize our cars even though they suck this car industry [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1748.1s)]
*  It's not only jobs during world war II. What did we do the ford factory? That's rolling tanks off of there, right? [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1754.58s)]
*  That's what the russians have the russians don't prioritize economic growth. They prioritize guns bullets and strategic autonomy [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1759.6200000000001s)]
*  So this is also the problem with ukraine ukraine does not have any of that [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1766.5s)]
*  They're totally reliant on the united states and on europe. So why is he pulling up talking shit? That's that's my point [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1770.5s)]
*  I think I just don't understand why you're giving us the facts. You're giving us like the truth behind it [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1775.78s)]
*  Uh, you're acknowledging your bias, but I think most americans are just reacting emotionally to this, right? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1780.3400000000001s)]
*  Of course which the idea of course as people do and it's important to speak to them at the emotional level because that's where [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1785.22s)]
*  most people lie [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1790.98s)]
*  so [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1792.1799999999998s)]
*  The idea that we have here is hey [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1793.3s)]
*  We've been giving you billions of dollars and then you came up and you were kind of talking spicy [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1794.74s)]
*  To the person who's feeding you. Yeah, that's right now [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1800.74s)]
*  I don't know why he thinks he can't just come kiss the ring [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1803.94s)]
*  Does he think he'll lose the support of the people in ukraine if he does it? [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1807.46s)]
*  I think he's why does he feel like he has leverage? I think he's been huffing european glue [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1811.22s)]
*  So the thing is is that if you look right now so right now literally as you and I are speaking [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1815.22s)]
*  They're in london crafting a peace agreement, which they're going to propose to us, but this is where it's all bullshit. So the [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1819.7s)]
*  france and [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1826.1000000000001s)]
*  France and germany came up with a peacekeeping plan where we'll have 30 000 troops there [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1827.5400000000002s)]
*  You don't have to do anything no, uh, no us troops on the ground. I'm like, okay good [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1832.26s)]
*  They're like, but um, you have to pay for it. You have to provide isr [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1836.26s)]
*  Which is intelligence support, you know and all that you have to do your isr [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1839.54s)]
*  You have to provide all the bullets you have to pay for it [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1842.5s)]
*  And so what are you revealing to us is that france and germany don't even have the capacity to forward deploy [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1844.34s)]
*  30,000 peacekeeping troops in a tiny country like ukraine i'm saying compared to the rest of the globe [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1850.0s)]
*  What should that tell you these militaries are nothing nato's own chief says that the russians produce more ammo in three months [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1855.78s)]
*  Than all of nato combined in an entire year. So that's with the united states [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1862.1s)]
*  Acting as if there's another option [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1866.74s)]
*  Yes, he thinks that the he he can't be so naive. He is oh man. I think he is the rhetoric [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1868.82s)]
*  That's coming. Is he trying to do a deal? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1873.62s)]
*  He he wants the uk and france and germany and all the other nato countries to give him a security guarantee before he will provide [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1875.78s)]
*  Or he will sign any ceasefire or any deal [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1882.98s)]
*  But again as I just told you guys any peacekeeping deal signed by france or germany is bullshit without the united states [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1885.46s)]
*  They don't have anything. So here's the thing why they're paper tigers. I heard what he said [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1893.1399999999999s)]
*  I heard what he said in it where he's essentially like hey [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1896.42s)]
*  We could do the ceasefire agreement, but they haven't respected ceasefire agreements in the past, right? [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1899.14s)]
*  Which I understand. No, he's actually correct about that [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1903.62s)]
*  So so so he's like why would this matter if I do a ceasefire agreement if we know for a fact that they don't respect [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1905.78s)]
*  It matters because uncle sam is the person who is signing underneath it. That's the fundamental difference. We've also signed protections [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1910.98s)]
*  Before for the ukraine if i'm not mistaken budapest [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1917.94s)]
*  Um, well, was it in budapest that we decided if they would uh relinquish their nuclear weapons who would support them? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1920.74s)]
*  Okay, let's talk about that too. I hear this a lot from the pro ukraine before before we go back to before we get to that [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1925.3s)]
*  Again, i'm not trying to like catch you here [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1930.1s)]
*  What i'm trying to do is somewhat understand his perspective and this is what I thought [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1931.86s)]
*  Because there's a part of me that goes listen as long as trump is in office [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1936.26s)]
*  Russia is not doing a single thing if this is agreed upon. Yeah [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1940.34s)]
*  Nothing's and if trump was going to be in office for the next 40 years [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1944.58s)]
*  this [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1948.4199999999998s)]
*  Version of a ceasefire where it doesn't guaranteed american muscle behind it this version of ceasefire [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1949.46s)]
*  Russia's going to respect 100 here is my concern if I am ukraine [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1955.78s)]
*  Yeah, or if I am zelensky and I think he handled it horribly in the room [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1959.78s)]
*  There's a much better way to say like if I was him if I did want to litigate in the media as jd [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1962.98s)]
*  Vance said what I would say is this [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1968.18s)]
*  I know I could sign this deal with you and you would protect us and I know that [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1970.4199999999998s)]
*  Russia would not mess with you because they take you seriously and they would not but what happens if next election [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1974.6599999999999s)]
*  We get the same people back that they did not take seriously and they're not afraid of yes [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1981.22s)]
*  How do I get security? [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1986.18s)]
*  Right i'm not worried about the next four years because I know that putin would not be stupid enough to mess with donald trump [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1987.54s)]
*  Right, I would keep on going that he would be crazy because you would do the ultimate thing [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1993.62s)]
*  Yeah, but in four years according to your laws, you're not going to have donald trump [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=1998.1s)]
*  We don't know what would happen and now we're left in the dark and the next administration [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2002.18s)]
*  Could have the same sway with putin as the last one did which is putin is not afraid with him [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2006.44s)]
*  He'll do what he wants. You're not you're not wrong at all [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2010.28s)]
*  And that's why you should shut your fucking mouth and you should sign that minerals deal because in that minerals deal it was [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2012.44s)]
*  In strategic interest for the united states to have a free a sovereign ukraine a business relation [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2017.24s)]
*  For example, why do we care about europe or taiwan or any of these places? [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2022.68s)]
*  You think we care about fucking democracy? We care about the tsmc chip in thailand. Okay [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2025.88s)]
*  Why do we care about vietnam because they make all of our clothing? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2029.24s)]
*  Why do we care about germany how many german cars are on the road it all [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2031.48s)]
*  Relations between states come down to trade that is a fundamental insight the problem of the post-world war two order [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2035.16s)]
*  Is what's led to this is that we have decided? [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2041.24s)]
*  Oh, it's democracy and feelings and all this other bullshit. It's like no the purpose of a navy [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2043.48s)]
*  So you're saying it's a trade deal. Yeah would incentivize the united states to protect them because if russia [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2047.96s)]
*  Yes invaded any further and it negatively impacted our united states economy. Yes. Now what if they [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2053.56s)]
*  Invaded further, but it didn't impact the places where our resources came from [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2060.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2065.0s)]
*  Well, this is a well that's a bigger question of whether we should even have nato membership for a lot of these countries [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2065.2400000000002s)]
*  Look, it's settled. It doesn't matter. The u.s [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2070.6s)]
*  Senate has ratified the treaty but there were a lot of people in the 90s when they were talking about nato expansion into latvia [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2072.28s)]
*  Lithuania and estonia were like guys this is in the traditional not only sphere of influence [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2078.76s)]
*  But what compelling interest does the united states have in these three countries like bilateral trade of those three? [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2083.08s)]
*  Probably does not even equal bilateral trade between us in a single province or a single state in mexico [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2089.32s)]
*  Like and see this is the thing we don't want to talk in balance sheet terms and it's important [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2095.16s)]
*  But come back coming back to your point. You're right. But here's the problem [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2099.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you have no leverage that's at the end of the day [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2102.92s)]
*  You do not matter to the united states and this is this is my bias again [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2106.2000000000003s)]
*  But at the end of the day the united states has no compelling interest over who compels the donetsk region of ukraine [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2111.2400000000002s)]
*  They just don't in fact all of ukraine even before the invasion ranked like 50 some billion [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2117.16s)]
*  Bilateral trade with the united states. That's one fourth of what we do with brazil if brazil was invaded by argentina and be like [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2122.92s)]
*  See you. Yeah. I was like good luck work it out. I'll buy my coffee from columbus [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2128.84s)]
*  He must know something we don't know [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2135.64s)]
*  By creating a financial alignment. I feel like he was even more leveraged like by creating an ideological position [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2138.2s)]
*  No, you're exactly right. Yes, yes [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2143.24s)]
*  In my mind like if you just made it purely financial then russia could now brokerage and be like hey if we can which they did [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2148.2s)]
*  They said that they were like, hey, we have rare earths, too [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2153.24s)]
*  By the way, which they do they actually have a lot more so by making it like purely like financial now [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2155.24s)]
*  Russia just come in and be like hey, it's a race to the bottom. Yes beat them on press [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2160.68s)]
*  Or russia could go we're gonna invade we're gonna take over those resources and we're gonna give them two for half price [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2164.68s)]
*  Right, yeah [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2169.96s)]
*  Russia just got a little bigger [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2172.04s)]
*  Because the linsky knows this it's a race to the bottom. So then now he has to say it's ideological [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2174.6800000000003s)]
*  We have to protect democracy. Yes, that is very double click everybody on that one [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2178.6s)]
*  So we have to so we have to protect democracy even though he is not protecting democracy within his own [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2182.52s)]
*  It falls apart on its very own. Sure, but it's literally he's doing the right thing to protect the longevity [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2188.2000000000003s)]
*  He's played his cards incredibly. He's not this moment. No, not this very poor until this you will study zelensky [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2193.56s)]
*  And I do not like zelensky. I think he's taking advantage of the united states [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2199.6400000000003s)]
*  I know it's an arrogant prick all of this it the way he handled himself [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2202.52s)]
*  Immediately after with the media by convincing the west and others that there is this compelling interest [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2206.6000000000004s)]
*  He was managed to get a hundred billion dollars from the world's superpower [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2211.7200000000003s)]
*  More than we spent on 20 years of the afghan national security forces. We have sent to ukraine in three years [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2214.76s)]
*  Think about that. That's fucking insane the greatest transfer of military aid in [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2220.92s)]
*  Modern us history on top of that he convinces all of these european nations germany france the great powers [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2226.04s)]
*  Not only to come to his defense [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2232.44s)]
*  But to tie his borders to their own and say it is a strategic interest of the french of the german of the uk people [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2233.7999999999997s)]
*  To make sure that we're compelling and you know in the beginning a lot of them did support that [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2240.12s)]
*  But and this is where it all starts to fall apart [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2244.6s)]
*  Now we're watching what will actually happen with the europe led by europeans [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2247.32s)]
*  So when we look at the polling that's in the uk and france and in germany [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2251.4s)]
*  They're like support for ukraine was sky high now. They're like should we continue or should we have a deal in almost every country? [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2255.1600000000003s)]
*  It's flipped so the europeans are now in a position where they would probably have to increase military aid [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2261.64s)]
*  To their maximum capacity give them everything not stripped down to the ground and they would still maybe [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2268.12s)]
*  I don't know maybe 1 6 or something like that and it wouldn't matter to russia because [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2273.56s)]
*  Oh, no, it wouldn't matter. I mean already the united states, uh, we have given ukraine 67 billion dollars in military aid [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2276.92s)]
*  That's more than every other country in the world combined, right? [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2283.56s)]
*  The europeans are like, oh we've given ukraine a bunch of aid. It's like bro. You've been in fucking refuge [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2285.88s)]
*  Yeah, but i'm saying this is bullshit, but i'm saying you could throw guns and bullets are the only you can throw 10 trillion [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2289.56s)]
*  At ukraine and russia will just match it with dead bodies. Oh, yeah, almost certainly [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2294.44s)]
*  I mean, it's a little more complicated than that [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2297.88s)]
*  I think the only thing that would really change is nuclear weapons on the ground, but which is not happening [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2299.8s)]
*  But that's actually let's return to that because one of the ways that the ukrainians often [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2303.7999999999997s)]
*  Bring up why america not has to support them and not just should is the budapest agreements and back the budapest memorandum [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2308.6s)]
*  Which was in the 90s where they agreed to give up their nuclear weapons and in exchange the united states was like yeah [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2315.3999999999996s)]
*  We'll you know think about protecting it. Oh, it's not we're gonna protect it [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2320.3599999999997s)]
*  No, and and even if we had said that it was never ratified by the u.s [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2323.64s)]
*  Senate and this is where you have to flip it and think about the russian [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2328.3599999999997s)]
*  Justification for invasion where they said your secretary of state said we will not expand nato. That's true [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2332.68s)]
*  Our secretary of state j burns under george hw bush. He was like look we're not gonna expand nato. Don't worry about it [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2339.72s)]
*  They were like, okay, that's the position of the u.s government [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2345.8s)]
*  Well, what changed they lost they lost the election bill clinton came into office george w bush came into office [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2348.36s)]
*  They changed the policy [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2353.32s)]
*  But the thing is is that the russians are like but you said it and what we would say is yeah [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2354.44s)]
*  What you just said the administration at the time said it that didn't make it the [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2359.08s)]
*  Treaty-binding obligation of the united states where two-thirds of the united states senate ratified. We will never expand nato [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2363.14s)]
*  So no, it's not fair to say that america guaranteed. That's not how our system works nor should it right the word of the president [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2369.72s)]
*  It's not a king who sets foreign policy. It's impertutely time exactly. And so the budapest memorandum [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2376.52s)]
*  Yes, it was a policy document, but it provides no [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2381.56s)]
*  Obligation from the united states to lift one finger for ukraine [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2385.64s)]
*  And if we think about again where the russians are coming in they're like, okay, so in the post [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2390.12s)]
*  Cold war era you guys bombed kosovo. Is that in nato? Why was that a nato operation you guys nato? [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2395.0s)]
*  Literally took out gadaffi, you know [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2403.46s)]
*  One of the things that the north koreans always tell us because we're like hey give up your nukes [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2406.04s)]
*  They're like i'm not giving up my nukes gadaffi gave up his nukes [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2409.24s)]
*  You shoved a right rod up his ass and blew the shit out of his own country [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2412.2s)]
*  Right. Do you think they would ever give up your nukes? [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2415.88s)]
*  Kim jong-un will never give up his nukes [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2418.44s)]
*  If I was them i'd be like fuck you if I was any country in the world right now [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2421.88s)]
*  Why would you I would be trying to develop them? Yeah, that's exactly right in spite of whatever agreement is going on [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2425.24s)]
*  It's the only thing that maintains your security [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2430.2s)]
*  Absolutely right and libya proves that iraq proves that the north korean regime surviving to this day proves that like and russia [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2432.2799999999997s)]
*  Ability its ability to invade ukraine and frankly get away with most of it is what nuclear weapons? [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2439.08s)]
*  So this is an argument love that reality, but it's just true for zelensky then if we cannot trust [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2443.96s)]
*  The daddy country i.e. america in this situation to protect [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2451.64s)]
*  Then why make a deal that you know that they won't reinforce so then you're just gonna fall apart without us [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2456.52s)]
*  Don't fall apart say we will say give us nukes. Okay. Yeah, you can say that and just say no [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2461.56s)]
*  No next question right give us give us nukes, you know what I would say develop it yourself then if you're so great [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2467.2400000000002s)]
*  You have all these great scientists all this go ahead. Nothing's stopping you. You can do whatever you want [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2472.28s)]
*  All right. Yeah, usually we do stop them, but it's well, I mean if they're trying to enrich [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2475.6400000000003s)]
*  If you guys want to go for it go for it [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2480.0400000000004s)]
*  I mean you literally will first of all you're being invaded second [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2481.5600000000004s)]
*  I mean your country their own analysts tell us that they'll fall apart in three months [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2484.36s)]
*  After the cutoff of us aid [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2488.76s)]
*  This is again just where we have a small nation that thinks it's a great power and can dictate terms [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2490.84s)]
*  Why do they think that that's what I don't understand. I think it's the europeans. I really do [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2495.48s)]
*  So the europeans are propping him up and thinking that they're like the last line of defense for democracy [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2499.32s)]
*  I I can't fathom. How do you not read a spreadsheet? That's what I do [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2505.64s)]
*  I'm like bro, look at the number of bullets coming in. I'm just i'm not even talking about the spreadsheet [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2508.68s)]
*  I'm talking about like what interest does putin have in expanding russia into europe? [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2512.68s)]
*  Oh, that's well, here's the thing. I mean does he have an interest? [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2518.2s)]
*  In tradition like you know russia controlled vast swaths of all that territory latvia lithuania [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2521.8799999999997s)]
*  Georgia all of these parts were a traditional part of the soviet or the russian empire [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2528.2799999999997s)]
*  But here's the thing three of those countries are just named are in nato [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2531.8799999999997s)]
*  So the interest you have to not do it is to avoid nuclear war. Also russia is a christian nation [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2534.9199999999996s)]
*  That's true. So I don't understand why he would expand west into europe with all these muslim countries like [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2539.7999999999997s)]
*  england and german [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2545.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead and tell him why do you want muslim nations adding to russia's part two? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2548.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. Yeah, okay. He actually does use a lot of that though. Really? [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2553.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, he talks a lot about the orthodox church and about how ukraine is attacking the russian orthodox, which is true [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2556.92s)]
*  It actually has been happening. That's my boy. They're attacking the russian orthodox and how it's like a defense of russian [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2562.28s)]
*  Whatever. I don't like that stuff. So so so okay, what do so the [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2567.6400000000003s)]
*  How does this how does this play out in the very near future? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2572.28s)]
*  What do you think happens near future? [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2576.12s)]
*  Does he tuck his tail and he refused to he had fox interview immediately afterwards. He had hours to think about it [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2579.0s)]
*  He did it live. Uh, he was four hours in between to apologize. He didn't apologize. Uh, he just said no [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2584.04s)]
*  He's like we had to have honest dialogue like he's huffing the europe like he believes that europeans europeans can't protect him [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2589.56s)]
*  He's in london literally as I said as we speak and the near future is they're gonna propose some peacekeeping plan [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2596.2s)]
*  America's gonna say no, why should we pay for that? Why should we continue to do it? [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2602.6s)]
*  And uh, it'll be look it's up to trump too [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2606.6s)]
*  I mean if I were trump to continue weapons flowing into ukraine when they're actively working against your policy is ridiculous [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2608.84s)]
*  Like I think that zelensky needs to find out tomorrow what reality and this again, this is my personal opinion [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2615.56s)]
*  Moving to from analyst this country [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2623.0s)]
*  Its greatest victory is survival you get to live [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2625.96s)]
*  Do you know how lucky but they don't that's what i'm trying to say somebody's drinking a kool-aid over there [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2630.44s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck it is. I don't get it. But yeah, I mean I do get it in a sense [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2635.08s)]
*  Would I accept that no, but i'm an american citizen. We have nukes. We have the greatest military [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2639.32s)]
*  the world has ever seen and I want to hear it too. Yeah, I don't get it because [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2643.96s)]
*  Let's just be honest here [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2648.68s)]
*  There's only a few countries [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2651.32s)]
*  Every other one [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2654.36s)]
*  Exists based on the relationship spheres of influence theory [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2655.96s)]
*  That's what you're talking about. Exactly. This is like china's a real country. Russia's a real country china [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2659.08s)]
*  America's a real country the u.s. UK germany. Yeah, well [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2663.08s)]
*  UK germany, I don't know if they're real they have nuclear weapons. So like, you know, yeah [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2667.72s)]
*  It buys you something. Okay, and they have the what g7 economies like they're not they're not ridiculous aircraft [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2671.96s)]
*  They are definitely going down if you can't bang on your own. Yeah, you're not a real country [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2676.92s)]
*  I agree with you by the way, i'm totally with you. Yeah, but I think when you have a nuke you you can fair enough [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2681.72s)]
*  Fair enough fair enough. Yeah, but now does it real quick real quick? [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2686.12s)]
*  So the point the point i'm trying to say is like if ukraine cannot defend itself. Yes empirically they cannot from russia [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2689.08s)]
*  Yeah, there's no chance. Yes without the support of these other countries. Yes [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2696.52s)]
*  You can't dictate to those other countries what the policy is. That's right, right because you don't have sovereignty [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2700.92s)]
*  That's right. You're not really a sovereign nation. Absolutely. You are a sovereign nation as much as someone else will protect you [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2706.76s)]
*  Yes, you are a vassal state if we think about the old [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2712.6800000000003s)]
*  This is uh, this is the issue with the way that we talk about this stuff is that [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2715.7200000000003s)]
*  Americans and unfortunately a lot of people don't want to speak in reality is america [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2719.7000000000003s)]
*  You know rules brace international order. Is that for the benefit of everybody else or is it the benefit of the united states consumer? [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2724.84s)]
*  Like let's all be honest here. Like let's be that's one of the things I actually love about trump trump is a mercantilist [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2729.8s)]
*  He says shit where he's like, yeah, we'll protect you you have to give us 500 million in minerals [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2735.08s)]
*  Yeah, or billion in minerals. Yeah, what no democracy also stuff. It's like guys [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2740.04s)]
*  Oh, we protect democracy, but one of our greatest allies is saudi arabia. Yeah, we don't care. We don't care [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2744.44s)]
*  We don't give a fuck. We don't like yeah, it's like oh you have oil. Okay, let's go [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2749.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, they don't kill people anymore. Okay. Yeah, they're promoting a lot of [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2753.96s)]
*  Great work over there. I apologize shake muhammad [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2760.0400000000004s)]
*  Please they're doing fantastic work over there [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2764.92s)]
*  Okay, it's just um, we've been told for the longest russia's the enemy russia's back [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2767.96s)]
*  Why all of a sudden are we okay with just like hey russia you can invade another country and take their land [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2772.52s)]
*  I think that's a fair question and uh, it comes down to uh, I feel bad for the I feel bad for the people who really [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2777.24s)]
*  Believe that and are now watching how geopolitics works in real time [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2783.0s)]
*  Like the idea that the united states who invaded iraq for literally no reason is going around dictating, you know legal and illy [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2786.3599999999997s)]
*  That's one of my favorite things by the way is russia illegally invaded ukraine. I was like, what's a legal invasion? [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2793.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I was like there's just an invasion. There's just an invasion. There's like there's just a successful invasion or an [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2798.2s)]
*  But to return to your point that goes to the religion [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2806.3599999999997s)]
*  That's what I was talking about the atlantic religion this idea that all borders are sovereign that they do not change from post-world [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2809.96s)]
*  War two countries don't just invade each other and I don't think they're wrong the real politic [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2815.96s)]
*  Answer for that would be invasion. All that is bad for business [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2820.2799999999997s)]
*  But the point that comes down to it is what compelling interest does the united states have in continuing this war? [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2823.24s)]
*  Not only for our economy, you know, the united states consumer probably paid an extra buck 50 for gas for two straight years because of russian [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2831.24s)]
*  Sanctions it was a disaster for our economy [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2838.2799999999997s)]
*  I actually think it's a huge reason biden lost the election if you think about a lot of the inflation where that came from [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2840.52s)]
*  But even more so what we what we know at the end of the day is that we cannot change the reality of this war [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2844.92s)]
*  Without direct united states intervention, but shouldn't be the interest of the world to not let countries do that [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2853.0800000000004s)]
*  There's no such thing as an interest in the world. That's just keep doing this [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2859.5600000000004s)]
*  Well, that's what stops russia. Well, nato actually is that we have nato membership around all these other countries [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2862.84s)]
*  And they're not going to invade because we're going to nuke them [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2868.5200000000004s)]
*  But I think every other I think country in the world is like we first of all, we have no obligation to do it [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2870.5200000000004s)]
*  But second, what is the impact on america? Do some deals? [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2876.36s)]
*  I think sov is russian oil all this shit is propaganda like all this and the u.s [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2880.6s)]
*  Is kind of a victim of its own propaganda. It doesn't need to be our enemy. There's no reason then if we can 1991 [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2885.56s)]
*  There's literally no reason that's what i'm saying. Like why are we like let's let's what is that? [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2890.04s)]
*  What is it the mcdonald's theory or whatever like two countries with the mcdonald's haven't gone to war which I think they have now [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2894.12s)]
*  But stupid but yeah, but the idea is like this uh, uh mutually assured success [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2898.7599999999998s)]
*  Like let's get in each other's pockets. Well, actually I disagree with that theory really it's called democratic peace theory [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2903.3199999999997s)]
*  Is the idea that democracies don't go to war with each other [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2908.04s)]
*  But there's also beyond that is like countries that trade and become more westernized [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2910.2s)]
*  It's like well china has got a lot of mcdonald's and they've actually become more authoritarian like the more [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2913.96s)]
*  Yeah, but we're not going to war with them. No, I agree. But my point is that it's it doesn't lead to [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2918.52s)]
*  Democratic outcomes per se. I don't care if they have to i'm fine. Yeah, i'm done with everybody else [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2923.64s)]
*  I hate this idea like a country got to get a democracy and within 10 years figure it out [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2931.8s)]
*  We had a whole civil war over democracy this shit takes hundreds of years and even then every election [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2935.64s)]
*  It's good versus evil. Yes, and presidents are getting shot at like let's stop acting like they got to figure it out immediately [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2941.4s)]
*  And if they don't want it fine, you don't want it. Whatever. This is what happens. Whatever we say goes [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2947.4s)]
*  That's the rule correct. That's the rule. Yeah, but it's not happening. No, but why? [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2952.68s)]
*  It's not happening. I think what saag is saying is throughout history. It's never actually been about that [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2957.64s)]
*  Yes, we didn't give a fuck about vietnam having democracy. There was some other resource we wanted [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2961.72s)]
*  We didn't go fuck about having to stop communism. We wanted oil. Yes, but that was a good [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2966.04s)]
*  That's a very good example is that was when ideology trumped national interests ukraine vietnam [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2971.8799999999997s)]
*  Ukraine vietnam iraq all have three things in common. They are wars not of national interest. They are wars of ideology [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2978.04s)]
*  That's where the american people see through it clearly. We're good. We're nice [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2983.96s)]
*  We want to protect and stop bad things from happening [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2987.48s)]
*  Or is it actually ideological reasons because what i'm picking up from you is what i'm picking up is [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2991.32s)]
*  We give the american people this ideology and that's why we need to invade and maybe not vietnam [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=2996.36s)]
*  I don't see it but with iraq it was oil it was whatever get back for george senior. Who knows [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3000.2s)]
*  There was another real reason and it's probably what trump seems to be kind of cutting through is like [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3004.36s)]
*  I don't give a fuck. Yeah, i'll give you freedom. It's not about your freedom. It's about what you can do for us [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3009.8s)]
*  That's exactly and that seems to be what it actually has always been about what i'm picking up here [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3014.52s)]
*  When you look at liberals and their main concern right now [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3018.28s)]
*  They're like america did not vote with the rest of the united nations. I'm like so who gives a fuck with the united [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3021.08s)]
*  Oh, so the un had a resolution condemning the invasion of russia. I'm over all that and they're like, oh america did not vote [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3026.6s)]
*  And I was like, okay, so montanegro voted for it. I'm like, why should I give a fuck what montanegro? [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3032.04s)]
*  Like what are we doing here? [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3036.44s)]
*  Just rolling over and letting we gotta stop letting people out [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3039.48s)]
*  Like what is that but see you say unamerican where it's like well, for example, like what is unamerican [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3042.52s)]
*  About russia invading a territory which has been disputed by their own population, you know, it's like okay [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3049.08s)]
*  But we didn't really I mean we didn't have a tree [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3055.48s)]
*  We don't have a treaty saying that we care about ukraine if we did i'd say look let's go for it [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3058.52s)]
*  We have to honor our word. So that's not the same thing now. They take over all their resources now russia gets stronger is that [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3062.4399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, at the advantageous to us it depends right but it depends on our relationship with russia and how what we want out of it [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3069.08s)]
*  I want us to reduce our nuclear weapons pointed at each other and actually focus on where [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3076.28s)]
*  The real economic growth of the world is happening in asia. So this is a very obama like idea [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3082.12s)]
*  They'll pivot to asia is that europe is a declining continent empirically true [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3087.16s)]
*  If you look at their economic growth versus ours [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3091.16s)]
*  50 of global gdp will be in asia by 2030 not that long ago only five years [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3093.64s)]
*  If you look at the concern the american foreign policy elite has for germany for france for frankly these countries where [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3098.44s)]
*  You know, they're basically have chosen their social welfare state fine [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3105.88s)]
*  But they have not backed up their defense or ability to protect themselves. We pay for french health care [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3109.32s)]
*  You know whether people like it or not like we protect them so they can have their nice socialist beliefs or germany or any of these [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3115.32s)]
*  Economies if they had to pay for their own military, they wouldn't be able to have this impossible. Okay, look at the way [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3122.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean think look at their militaries and their inability. They say this is such a compelling interest [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3127.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm like, we'll fucking fight for it then go ahead [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3131.7200000000003s)]
*  You won't do it and you think the average frenchman will give up his health care to protect ukraine. No [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3133.4s)]
*  That's another reason why it's all complete bullshit [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3138.92s)]
*  But my point is that things that most americans don't know for what's important and I think that like changes [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3141.1600000000003s)]
*  I think it changes your opinion emotionally now [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3146.44s)]
*  There is there are certain advantages to having this type of leverage on the world, of course, right? [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3148.84s)]
*  Like obviously if these countries cannot defend themselves, they have nuclear weapons france [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3153.2400000000002s)]
*  But if they cannot defend themselves, they can do it in a uh in in like a a very dire situation [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3157.0800000000004s)]
*  But i'm saying in a situation like ukraine is like they're not [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3161.8s)]
*  One billion euro to ukraine. It's like piss off bro. You have nothing [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3165.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, what military do you have? It's a joke the ideological thing of like how can we let this happen is like [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3168.6800000000003s)]
*  What do you mean like I actually think it's kind of chauvinistic to say that we have the ability to [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3174.52s)]
*  Conduct all of the affairs of the world like rarely what's happened that might have been true in 1991 [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3178.92s)]
*  In what's called the unipolar moment when the united states was the sole superpower [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3184.12s)]
*  That's just not the case like we have a total return to multi-polarity where you have the rise of china of india of you know [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3188.2s)]
*  Even russia continues to punch above its weight. Uh, japan south korea north korea all of these [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3195.0s)]
*  Countries this this idea that I think is actually unamerican is that we should be conducting all of the affairs of the world instead [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3200.6s)]
*  What we should return to is a huge is to [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3208.7599999999998s)]
*  Lose some of our hubris and actually say okay. What's actually important to us. What are we gonna do? [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3212.68s)]
*  This is the line right here [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3219.3199999999997s)]
*  And this is traditional american foreign policy going back to the monroe doctrine the monroe doctrine was you guys do whatever the fuck you want [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3220.8399999999997s)]
*  Just don't come over here to the western hemisphere [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3228.36s)]
*  This is ours right over here and we acknowledge the great powers of europe and from that point forward even in the cold war [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3230.6s)]
*  We're like look it sucks that hungary is communist, but what the fuck are we gonna do about? [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3237.4s)]
*  They got news [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3241.4s)]
*  Right [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3244.84s)]
*  Because we're not taking anything but yes, I like the idea this is what I like the idea [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3247.2400000000002s)]
*  I like the idea of extending our influence around the world as far as we want to go with it [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3251.8s)]
*  Okay, but I don't want that influence to be like plays or whatever. That's a great point [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3256.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't care about identity politics influence. Yes. I care about geopolitical influence. Yes, I care about pushing [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3261.7999999999997s)]
*  Certain countries to agree with us on certain deals that are advantageous to us [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3269.0s)]
*  Yes, I want the best deal that we could possibly have for america with every single country in the world [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3273.96s)]
*  I don't care if you're a democracy. I don't care if you're a dictatorship. I don't care if you're pro-trans [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3278.44s)]
*  I don't care if you're an answer to none of that personal shit. I give a fuck about [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3282.6s)]
*  I just care about the money. Yeah, but I do want to exert that influence around the world [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3286.04s)]
*  Because that influence benefits americans and that's what I care the most about but that's I think the problem is that right now [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3289.4s)]
*  We piss all this money and influence away. For example, the united states the blue. Oh, can I say one thing real quick? [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3293.8s)]
*  I actually think that it reduces our global influence [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3299.08s)]
*  Yes, you're right when we're trying to push these identity politics issues to these other countries that resisted culturally [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3301.8s)]
*  Yeah, where back in the day I think that we had so much [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3308.36s)]
*  Uh gravitas with these other countries because they looked at the west especially america as this like beacon of hope [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3311.88s)]
*  Like when you're seeing a guy on a fucking horseback with a revolver going around and shooting you're like, oh my god [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3317.56s)]
*  America looks kind of cool [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3322.52s)]
*  Now when you see some like neutered cuck telling you that like his four-year-old daughter is actually a boy [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3323.96s)]
*  You're like, I don't know if I want to be american. I think you're at first of all, you're nailing it [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3329.88s)]
*  I'll give you a perfect one on this. Okay, our ambassador under biden to japan was ron emmanuel [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3333.32s)]
*  Rom emmanuel inserts himself into a gay marriage debate in japan because japan was having a debate about gay marriage [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3338.68s)]
*  The japanese conservative party is furious. I go. Oh the us ambassador of japan has one fucking job. How many toyotas? [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3345.4s)]
*  Can we make it? [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3352.04s)]
*  That's the irony that rom emmanuel is just on bill marshall and he was and he said this sentence. Yeah, he goes [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3353.16s)]
*  Uh, we need to get back into the education of the kids in schools [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3361.0s)]
*  He goes he says this specifically because they were talking about like, uh, chicago [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3365.4s)]
*  And all these like dem cities that were like kind of struggling and it wasn't posed as like a lib suck [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3369.0s)]
*  It was like what do you think about this? You've run a city and uh, he goes, uh [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3373.7200000000003s)]
*  He says, uh, he goes, uh, uh, we need to get into the classrooms and out of the bathrooms [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3377.7200000000003s)]
*  The irony, yeah, right exactly. He's petitioning for gay marriage [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3385.0800000000004s)]
*  I don't care what you guys do with your gaze over there [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3388.6800000000003s)]
*  Matter of fact if you got some really talented gays over there and you want to kill them, let's bring them over here [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3391.16s)]
*  We do great shit with our gays gays flourish in america, right? It's just my point [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3396.04s)]

*  Yeah. Yep. I don't know if I got paid a penny. No turns out [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3644.52s)]

*  It seems like tik tok does good for them. It seemed like I think that's what they want us to communicate with this ad [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3677.64s)]
*  The only thing I care about is tik tok is paying me money to say this. Yeah [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3683.4s)]
*  They're paying you money and new money and new money too. It's good for our small business [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3686.7599999999998s)]

*  But if you'd like to learn more about tik tok's contribution to the u.s. Economy and most important [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3695.96s)]
*  Flagrant, you can go to tik tok economic impact.com. Did you know that? [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3700.58s)]
*  Now you know first thing just discussing doge really quickly [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3706.6s)]
*  I think that there are very few americans [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3710.44s)]
*  That would say [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3713.7200000000003s)]
*  that they do not support [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3715.48s)]
*  A reduction in waste and inefficiency, correct, especially when it comes to government institutions. So this is a bipartisan [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3718.12s)]
*  Measure, yeah that that americans are supportive of [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3726.68s)]
*  doge has become [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3731.08s)]
*  Incredibly partisan [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3733.14s)]
*  First, can you tell me why you think that is I think it is about wars of credibility of [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3734.84s)]
*  Institutions and of process so something I think what does that mean? [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3742.82s)]
*  This is really and speak to me emotionally like why why does i'm not talking about like [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3746.6s)]
*  Politically what it has i'm talking about why the average person on twitter [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3751.62s)]
*  Feels compelled to be so critical of doge [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3755.96s)]
*  Like what do you think is what being communicated to them and why are they having such a knee-jerk reaction to it? [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3759.64s)]
*  Knowing that they do want to reduce government inefficiencies for them. It's about [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3765.7999999999997s)]
*  Elon's complete and total judgment over this they don't trust elon. I would say that's it. So is that fair? [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3770.3399999999997s)]
*  Uh, yeah, I do think it's fair. I I do think it's fair for a number of reasons [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3775.16s)]
*  What's the steel man against the steel man against doge is that you have a person who is unelected by the united states? [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3778.28s)]
*  Who is the sole power over what gets cut which violates the constitution? [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3784.76s)]
*  Because the constitution the power of the purse is within congress congress gets to decide what programs get cut or not [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3789.56s)]
*  He is according to them illegally shutting off and doing these things and also at times has [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3795.48s)]
*  Conflicts major conflicts of interest in many of the decisions [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3801.48s)]
*  What is an example of those because the perfect example is right now state department was my friend ryan grim [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3805.08s)]
*  He works with us at breaking points broke a story about there was originally [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3810.3599999999997s)]
*  Going to be some state department contract awarded to tesla for I forget the number [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3814.2799999999997s)]
*  It was like maybe four million or something after trump got elected that contract went up to 400 million [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3818.44s)]
*  For tesla's armed up cyber trucks and then they actually took the word tesla off the website and changed it to electric vehicle [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3824.12s)]
*  Now, okay, it's not great. Right? Can we all admit? It's not great. So so this is this is good before we move on [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3830.84s)]
*  Yeah, we got to appease people emotionally who see things like this and go. Hey, this doesn't feel constitutional [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3836.84s)]
*  This feels manipulative. We feel taken advantage of that's a pretty steel steel man [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3844.36s)]
*  Pittsburgh steel [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3850.84s)]
*  So it's like [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3855.2400000000002s)]
*  That's why like I feel like there's a lot of gaslighting going on and as much as we all agree we want to reduce government efficiency [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3856.44s)]
*  I mean like akash hilariously says that every single week here. He's just like firing them all like [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3862.44s)]
*  98 of them can go. Yeah, so yeah, so 99 [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3868.04s)]
*  There is that feeling but we have to give some credence to a situation like that and there might be more context [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3872.6s)]
*  Just there might be a more nuanced take to it. I get it. Maybe elon could describe it sure [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3877.96s)]
*  But on the surface people acting [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3882.2000000000003s)]
*  Reacting emotionally to it that does look like corruption in another way [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3884.7599999999998s)]
*  I like the charlotte main thing. I heard your argument about this. What was that? [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3889.72s)]
*  Well, I thought it was interesting where you were like, hey when if you're a cop and you come to me and i'm like [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3893.08s)]
*  Yo, don't look in the basement. You're like there's some shit in the fucking there's some shit in the basement [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3896.7599999999998s)]
*  so so but also just the idea of like [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3900.8399999999997s)]
*  government spending yeah [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3903.7s)]
*  Going to certain people like this happens on like a [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3906.3599999999997s)]
*  Municipal level where like the mayor is friends with the person that has the construction company and that construction company gets the rebuilding [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3909.6400000000003s)]
*  Project for the local bridge, right and then he gets the kickback, right now [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3917.32s)]
*  We know that that's a for a form of corruption when we see this [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3921.2400000000002s)]
*  It's okay for someone to look at and be like that kind of feels like the corruption you're trying to scrub out [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3926.04s)]
*  Yeah, now he might make the best vehicle for that job [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3931.32s)]
*  Yeah, it might be right to increase that spending right but I also need some transparency there [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3934.2000000000003s)]
*  And you need to come out ahead of it not wipe tesla off the car [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3939.56s)]
*  You need to come out ahead of it and gain my trust as an american and go hey [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3943.2400000000002s)]
*  This was the original deal this amount was going to be spent over here [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3947.1600000000003s)]
*  We think that this is better for these reasons and that's why more money is spent there [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3950.92s)]
*  And I totally get why you think this looks like a favor handed over right like stop [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3954.84s)]
*  But the american people are done being lied to yep [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3959.56s)]
*  And when we see shit like that, we have such little trust [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3961.8s)]
*  It's almost like a girl who gets cheated on by every boy. They kind of should have little trust. They're not wrong. They're correct [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3964.52s)]
*  The girl that gets cheated on by every boyfriend the second a dude is talking to a waitress and she's laughing the knee-jerk reaction is [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3969.5600000000004s)]
*  Oh that motherfucker's cheating too. Yeah, so that's what we feel like when we see yes. Yes, you're right [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3975.0800000000004s)]
*  And I think it is important to talk about it in that way and that's where it comes back to process [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3979.2400000000002s)]
*  So like you said we've got doge which is kind of unilaterally deciding what and what is not [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3983.0s)]
*  Gets to be spent according to them [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3988.28s)]
*  And so one of the interesting things I took away from your thing was charlomane [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3989.8s)]
*  And if I were charlomane what I would have said is andrew it's fine to look but they're not looking [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3992.92s)]
*  They're actually acting and the acting is the part where I think a lot of the liberals are I think correctly upset [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=3996.6s)]
*  I mean, let's be honest like if george soros or whatever was deciding what is what not getting spent [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4002.44s)]
*  I mean, we would freak the fuck out. Okay with it. Yeah, you be not not you [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4006.7599999999998s)]
*  Like let's say conservatives are more okay with it because your guy is doing the cuts [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4010.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. But if it was george soros is a perfect example. Yeah, they the right would would rightfully [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4015.32s)]
*  Yeah, it'd be they'd be like this is a constitutional crisis. Yeah, they're like we need january 6 again [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4020.68s)]
*  You know like it would be wise so that maybe the best way to do this is have doge look into it share the findings [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4025.0s)]
*  Transparently what they are doing and then hand it over to [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4031.46s)]
*  Like it would be congress so that would congress if you want to do this like and this is you know [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4034.84s)]
*  Remember when I said process [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4039.0s)]
*  Yeah, that is actually a huge part of it because the real problem that they have is the unilateral decision making the conflict of interest [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4040.04s)]
*  Possibly being over. I mean there have been a ton of shit like that like the nlrb and other things [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4047.0s)]
*  I've sounded like crystal right now. She's got a she's got a list like 15 pages long of all this conflict of interest [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4051.4799999999996s)]
*  And you know what I have to say I go. Yeah, you're right [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4057.72s)]
*  I was like, you know [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4059.3199999999997s)]
*  Empirically, this is not good [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4060.3599999999997s)]
*  like when you look at it in that way and now if he had sold all of his tesla stock if he had actually [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4062.4399999999996s)]
*  Offloaded all of this and he was still doing it now [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4068.9199999999996s)]
*  I would have a lot more trust in that and I think most people would do absolutely and I think I don't think that members [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4071.3999999999996s)]
*  Of congress and others should be allowed [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4076.04s)]
*  Anybody in the government should be allowed to be able to even have the appearance of corruption because of the way the corruption is now [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4078.6s)]
*  So in bedrock into our I was very hopeful for doge and then I feel like honestly they just kicked the wrong person out. Um [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4084.9199999999996s)]
*  Obviously i'm biased toward him but like his his entire thing was i'm gonna use the constitution i'm gonna [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4094.3599999999997s)]
*  Do this in a way that is palatable, but it's gonna be uncomfortable and he was up front about all that [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4100.04s)]
*  And elon is just kind of like what shocked me about it is trump's deference to elon [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4104.5199999999995s)]
*  I think that's the part where maybe you guys can help me understand it because [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4108.759999999999s)]
*  I don't like first of all it drives me fucking crazy when elon's in the cabinet room [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4112.5199999999995s)]
*  Wearing a fucking t-shirt and hat and everybody else is in a suit and he's standing [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4116.12s)]
*  In a room where if you guys ever been in the cabinet room [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4120.28s)]
*  The president's chair is bigger than everybody else's chair. No person ever is supposed to be higher than the president [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4122.5199999999995s)]
*  There's a rule. There's a famously in the west wing [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4129.0s)]
*  It's like when the president stands nobody sits and in my opinion when the president sits nobody stands [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4130.76s)]
*  Why is he not standing? Why is he it just to me? It's like this is where the libs are correct, dude [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4135.4800000000005s)]
*  Like there's some weird shit going on here. I don't really get it. I don't like it. I can I can tell you [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4139.72s)]
*  Yeah, like I from talking to trump. Yeah [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4145.240000000001s)]
*  If trump feels like someone has information [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4149.88s)]
*  That he does not have he becomes a listener. Yeah, he's a differential. You're right. You're right [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4153.8s)]
*  The second he's like, you know something I don't know and I think that's what makes him [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4158.44s)]
*  So much better [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4164.44s)]
*  Than anybody that the democrats had in terms of understanding the problems of everyday people. Oh sure because [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4166.28s)]
*  Unfortunately, I think [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4172.74s)]
*  And the republicans too like remember he's not like a traditional republican guy. So it's like [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4174.44s)]
*  Politicians in general there is a snobbishness to them this feeling of like we know what you need [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4179.3s)]
*  Let us handle it [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4185.0s)]
*  And he's the type of person just from that interaction we had who's like the second you have information [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4186.36s)]
*  He doesn't have he gets quiet and he kind of keys in even if it's what is the life of an everyday american? [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4191.88s)]
*  Because I don't live that life [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4197.96s)]
*  It doesn't have to be what's the science behind blah blah blah [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4199.799999999999s)]
*  You see this all the time when he's in the barbershop or whatever [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4202.44s)]
*  He's a genius because what he does is he'll take your problem and he'll turn it around into the campaign and he's like [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4204.839999999999s)]
*  That's what the great the greats always do this is that they take the question [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4210.5199999999995s)]
*  Listen to what people are struggling to go to the essence like no, but how low is the bar for politicians that were like? [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4213.64s)]
*  Well, unfortunately, this guy listens to us. Yeah [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4218.76s)]
*  Yeah, well what they do is they take you seriously, but not literally [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4221.64s)]
*  So my favorite moment in a debate is when some lady in the 92 campaign asked bill clinton about the national debt [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4225.96s)]
*  And it's like she didn't really know what she was talking about and he's like she's talking about the economy [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4232.200000000001s)]
*  He's like we've had four years of trickle-down economics. It hasn't worked [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4235.88s)]
*  You know all this he didn't ask her same question about the national debt [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4238.4400000000005s)]
*  But the point is is that he's like she's talking about the economy [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4241.0s)]
*  Like he knows he can see the truth the truth behind it exactly and that's what trump I think is very good at [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4243.400000000001s)]
*  That's what all the greats are very good. Uh, and yeah, I mean continue like the elon thing to me [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4248.2s)]
*  I and this will make me very unpopular. I think it's becoming a problem. I think yeah that this liberal [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4255.08s)]
*  Uh, no because right now there's a narrative online which is in my opinion cope is that a lot of these liberals cope [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4261.400000000001s)]
*  Like cope as in like they're coping that they're coping [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4267.719999999999s)]
*  Uh, like they're getting an excuse. Yeah, they're living in denial [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4271.4s)]
*  There's a cope right now from the right that all of these liberal gatherings are astroturfed and you know what you're right [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4274.28s)]
*  But the thing is is that you actually a lot of terms that some people might not know. Okay, so [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4280.04s)]
*  In astroturf astroturf means yeah fake grass, right? So like yeah, what it means is that a large [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4285.32s)]
*  Is people are being paid to protest. I do not think that's true [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4291.32s)]
*  I think this has happened in the past this has happened in the past and it is an integral thing [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4294.92s)]
*  But that's actually what a lot of liberals said about the tea party back in 2010 [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4298.92s)]
*  They're like the coke brothers are paying for it [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4302.68s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, bro [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4304.280000000001s)]
*  But you can't just pay people to show up and be angry and you still got blown the fuck out in the 2010 elections [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4305.08s)]
*  What i'm worried about is the perception perhaps correctly that trump is not [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4310.200000000001s)]
*  Completely in control of his own presidency and we do see some of that like in terms of the priority the priority right now [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4316.1s)]
*  Is not only with doge. It's like the media capture around this elon as the [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4323.32s)]
*  Force where I think should be on trump and trump has in my opinion a 10 times better [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4328.04s)]
*  Political understanding of america like I think if he his narrative of the election was about immigration and it was about the economy [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4332.36s)]
*  What I worry about right now for trump is he's absorbing all of this pressure where elon is, you know [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4339.08s)]
*  Slapshot cutting this bringing people back by his own admission. I'm not making this up [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4344.42s)]
*  Like he's like we fire people who are doing Ebola. We brought them back right now [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4348.12s)]
*  They just fired a bunch of people from noah the national oceanic administration [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4351.16s)]
*  Which those are guys who fly into the hurricane and be like it's a category four or whatever and it's like dude [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4354.5199999999995s)]
*  I've seen politics in the past like the most dangerous thing a politician can do is misinterpret their mandate [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4359.5599999999995s)]
*  So the most recent example we have is 2004 george w bush the last republican to win the popular vote [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4365.639999999999s)]
*  Uh republican he wins that popular vote for one reason keep us safe iraq 9-eleven. You know what he does? [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4371.16s)]
*  Let's privatize social security [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4376.92s)]
*  He's like, yeah the american people voted for me. I want to privatize social security [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4379.24s)]
*  Blown the fuck out in the 2006 midterm election. Not only that katrina and what i'm worried about for trump is [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4384.12s)]
*  Dude, even if it's not your fault if there's a natural disaster and the dems can point to noah getting you're about to get fucking [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4391.4s)]
*  Crucified dude same with uh, you know, you know how lucky they are that crash happened in the first week of the trump administration [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4399.62s)]
*  Can you imagine that happened a year from now after some doge cuts or whatever with the faa? [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4404.92s)]
*  They would be destroyed so they will be responsible. I am very worried for them that they're they're hitching their [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4409.64s)]
*  entire political reputation and the most critical part of your presidency the first hundred days if [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4417.08s)]
*  All history of a presidency is almost certainly the first 18 months and of those 18 months always the first hundred days [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4423.72s)]
*  We're about 30 some seven days or whatever when you're talking right now [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4429.4800000000005s)]
*  It's not that much longer to go and in that first hundred days elon has been the number one story [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4432.6s)]
*  If I were donald trump or whatever I would want my number one story to be historic or whatever executive action on inflation [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4436.92s)]
*  I'd be having inflation press conferences every single day and tom homen in mass speed deportation. That's all i'm doing [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4443.64s)]
*  I'm just talking about mexico. I'm talking about shutting down the border [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4449.320000000001s)]
*  I'm having tom homen on television every single day not to say he isn't but he's drawing away [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4451.96s)]
*  It's taking control of the narrative. He's taking control of the year. I think it's brilliant [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4456.4400000000005s)]
*  Right now is the let this happen so I I thought that for a time like you tell me why tell me why you think [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4460.04s)]
*  Elon as a shield right let elon because all these cuts are going to be difficult. Yeah, but at the end of the day [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4465.16s)]
*  Everyone's still absorbing all of that like energy, but right now everyone's looking at elon doing that's very true [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4469.4800000000005s)]
*  I I actually thought that for a while. I was like maybe elon is the whipping boy to like sit there and absorb [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4474.6s)]
*  But yeah, i'm very worried that trump and losing this is why you were talking about steve bannon [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4480.2s)]
*  There's a reason dude. I think bannon is the smartest person in the magna movement [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4485.24s)]
*  And wow [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4489.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh absolutely [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4494.36s)]
*  100 he was mago before real quick before we get off this if if I felt like these were trump's ideas to cut these [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4495.719999999999s)]
*  Then things and elon is doing it. I would be on board with you. These don't seem like trump ideas [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4501.48s)]
*  It seemed like elon. No, no, I got that's why I don't agree on that quickly because there's a very important [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4505.5599999999995s)]
*  I like that [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4513.88s)]
*  We're talking tech yeah [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4519.24s)]
*  Yeah, all right for all our young listeners back in the day you had to click something twice in order to open it [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4527.88s)]
*  Uh now I think we just I thought he meant that as liking it. Uh, well, I meant like expand [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4533.0s)]
*  Okay, go go open open that file this is why I was talking about bannon [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4543.32s)]
*  There are multiple theories which intersect like if you think of what am I thinking of venn diagram like the venn diagram [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4546.84s)]
*  Is that elon is part of libertarian right like cut the government to the end of cut the government now? [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4553.16s)]
*  Bannon would say attack the administrative state to replace the administrative state as in the government itself should be the power [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4559.24s)]
*  the determination of the god of the path of the country of business of breaking up the centers of gravity that are [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4566.04s)]
*  Non-governmental powers facebook google, etc. Elon is somebody who's very against something like that much more like an anarcho [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4571.96s)]
*  Capitalist and on top of that is like traditional conservatism which agrees a little bit with this but is also obsessed with like the religious right? [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4579.14s)]
*  Constitution etc. So like right now my fear is that maga while it definitely agrees with the administrative state here [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4586.18s)]
*  Is that they are losing the capacity to make their argument that no actually and this is what trump and jd [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4593.56s)]
*  I think believe is that the government itself should have power over the direction of the country should have the ability to tell social media [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4598.599999999999s)]
*  Companies don't censor as opposed to having a billionaire buy it like that's a nice workaround [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4604.919999999999s)]
*  But look, I mean zuck went on rogan and said oh, we're not gonna fact check anymore [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4609.639999999999s)]
*  I did a post about Lyme disease. It got fact-checked the next fucking day and it's still not down, right? [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4613.4s)]
*  Yeah, and you know, there's no enforcing mechanism [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4617.16s)]
*  Within that only the government can fix that problem for me or for all americans [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4620.04s)]
*  So that's where I would say it's like there's important theories of government which are very at odds [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4623.799999999999s)]
*  So there is that like bannon group like and again [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4628.28s)]
*  I don't think bannon actually cares about the country as much as he likes like rallying people up for attention [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4630.5199999999995s)]
*  Really? I think he's a surprise about I think he's a really I think he's an acute listener [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4636.44s)]
*  So I think he can like spot trends early [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4641.16s)]
*  And I think that he's a good enough communicator that he can fan the flame fan the flames of those trends early [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4644.04s)]
*  And those things can grow to be bigger things now like the nazi salute [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4650.12s)]
*  Yeah [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4653.8s)]
*  That's like a perfect example of like he probably knew what he was doing and he didn't do it enough [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4656.04s)]
*  Definitely knew yeah. Yeah. So it's like so but there's a perfect example [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4660.6s)]
*  Like he's he's not actually trying to like make it bet like if you really cared about american and patriotism [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4663.160000000001s)]
*  You're not throwing up a nazi salute because you would have some respect to all the americans that died fighting the nazis [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4668.04s)]
*  I think he hates I think he hates liberals and he wants a mediator exactly exactly [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4671.72s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's just an attention seeking thing and like he's gonna it's dogwit. So it's like how can I throw up? [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4674.68s)]
*  Now I think there are ways [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4679.48s)]
*  That's why I don't take him like seriously as someone who actually cares about america and more someone who just cares about like [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4681.48s)]
*  Causing ruckus and like getting some attention in the midst now [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4686.599999999999s)]
*  What I would say is that it's very easy to pacify the base that he's riling up [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4690.12s)]
*  So anytime he riles some people up you just need a headline to be like disney cuts all di programs and then they go [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4694.84s)]
*  All right. Well, we're waiting exactly anytime they start rallying up [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4701.96s)]
*  You just need a headline that goes don't to give back five thousand dollars every single minute and then they calm down [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4705.64s)]
*  It don't matter how many fucking not gonna happen, which is of course [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4710.12s)]
*  But neither is anything that bannon says. Oh, well, I don't think that's true. I mean like what like what does he say? [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4713.56s)]
*  What's gonna be executed? Well, what about mass deportation dude? Like what about like trump literally ran on me? [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4718.68s)]
*  He could do it if he wanted to yeah, of course. No, no, no [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4723.08s)]
*  Again, when I say like anything that bannon says, of course [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4726.04s)]
*  There are things that he is supportive of like I don't know like the all every single belief that he has or everything that he's ran on [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4728.76s)]
*  Yeah, and i'm sure that certain things like deportation is not a specifically bannon thing [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4734.12s)]
*  I think there's a lot of support for it. Yes. What i'm trying to say is they're going to be these people that can [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4738.5199999999995s)]
*  Rally the support of the disenfranchised and he's incredibly good at it [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4744.04s)]
*  He is this is one of the things that like I don't want to get away from doge right here [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4747.48s)]
*  But this is one of the things I think the dems really struggle with [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4751.0s)]
*  Is it like they could very easily win the next election if they made this a class issue? [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4753.5599999999995s)]
*  Like they just need to make it a class issue like it's tough for them though [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4757.88s)]
*  Yeah, because they're in the pockets of the rich and all the people that are running the party are these ivy league trust fund babies [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4761.5599999999995s)]
*  So if ivy league trust fund babies are the people making the intellectual decisions for your party [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4767.48s)]
*  You can't speak to the poor now like her or dislike her aoc. It doesn't matter your thought. Okay people [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4771.8s)]
*  Fuck with her because they think she's trying to help. Yeah, you might disagree with how she's gonna help [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4778.12s)]
*  But she comes across as a working class girl that wants to help [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4782.599999999999s)]
*  That's what dems need Bernie and she outran she outran biden in her district [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4786.84s)]
*  She's a lot of I interviewed or on our show not me but our team we interviewed a ton of aoc [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4789.96s)]
*  Trump voters and they were like, yeah, I trust them both to fight for the work. Exactly. I thought it was actually fascinating [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4795.16s)]
*  So the dems should look at that specifically and be like, oh wow [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4799.72s)]
*  She's locked in and people believe she wants to help them and they don't really they become disillusioned with these other figures [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4803.32s)]
*  They're in my opinion. They're probably in the pockets of the billionaire class a little bit too much [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4811.0s)]
*  So they can't make it about money which they could make it about money so easily and regain the working class in a heartbeat [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4814.6s)]
*  They have not so sure about that. Okay, maybe not but but but they'd have a better chance than making about identity politics [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4822.120000000001s)]
*  Which they did make it about before and now it seems like they're even rama manuel is moving away [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4827.72s)]
*  Let's get out of the bathroom. Look they say a lot of there are political realities that are huge problems for democrats [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4831.88s)]
*  Number one rich white people are now dems right the base of the democratic party. It's not it's not it's a very it's more nuanced than that [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4836.52s)]
*  It's ivy league educated nepo babies. I was about to get to that. Yeah, there are there are tons of rich white people [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4843.16s)]
*  They're like, you know, i'm over this shit. It's the specifically ivy league [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4849.32s)]
*  Like four generation money sheltered sheltered. They've never had a real job [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4853.64s)]
*  Of course, those are the people out there that are like telling you what you should feel and how you should vote [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4857.72s)]
*  And real working class people like people have actually had a real fucking job in their life [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4863.64s)]
*  Do not want some trust fund kid telling them what they should vote. Absolutely. It's pretentious [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4867.4s)]
*  What I was going to get to is when I say rich white people [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4871.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean a very specific class where one of the number one determiners of how you vote and party id is four-year college degree [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4873.719999999999s)]
*  So if you attend a four-year college degree institution, which also correlates very much with income [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4879.5599999999995s)]
*  Then you are much more likely to be a democrat [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4884.36s)]
*  And that's why you know, even rich white is not exactly the right term because we all know blue collar trucker millionaires down in florida [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4886.12s)]
*  They're fucking republican of shit, right? [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4892.5199999999995s)]
*  But these guys did not go to college necessarily and they have very different cultural attitudes [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4894.5199999999995s)]
*  I think I talked about this the last time I was here [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4899.0s)]
*  Charles murray one of my favorite books of all time is called coming apart and it's exactly about how americans with college degrees [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4901.4s)]
*  Have concentrated themselves in something called super zip codes, you know [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4908.12s)]
*  The whole foods index like if you have a whole foods [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4911.08s)]
*  You're much more likely to vote for a democrat if you have uh, whatever generic or aldi, right? [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4912.68s)]
*  You know much more likely to vote republican what's happened is that america is culturally separated probably more than ever before [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4916.84s)]
*  Are we all watching white lotus? I am I love white lotus. That's actually a signifier of like you're out of touch [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4923.08s)]
*  Right the most popular the most popular show in the country is lawman cis all right, or land man [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4928.92s)]
*  Which oh my god, okay. I I love parts of land man, but dude, what a fucking disaster [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4935.24s)]
*  We could talk about but there's a perfect example. It's like some people [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4940.6s)]
*  It's elitist. Yeah, I mean, I'm sorry. I don't think women act that way [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4944.36s)]
*  Maybe that's just me. I genuinely why are you like rational on the show or what's going on? [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4948.12s)]
*  It's like they're like, it's like a billy bob. You need your dick [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4952.28s)]
*  Suck [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4956.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, why are we recycling when I could be sucking your dick? Okay. I'm glad you feel this sounds like a great show [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4958.2s)]
*  For some guy who's like yeah, this is a women talk [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4964.76s)]
*  What the fuck is going on here? Why is a 29 year old playing a 17 year old in panties? What is happening fire? [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4967.8s)]
*  Anyway, yeah, I mean not fire. Yeah, right [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4974.28s)]
*  Most popular show in the country. So what the fuck do I know? [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4977.56s)]
*  But like my point is exactly about the cultural separation is why it's hard for democrats and I think even for [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4979.88s)]
*  AOC aoc and them may speak in the language of the identity politics and also hold [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4986.68s)]
*  Class politics and what I really have come to believe is that we live in a cultural moment. So there is a [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4992.6s)]
*  So previously the 2020 what i'm fascinated by the election the highest turnout in modern history [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=4999.16s)]
*  Equivalent turnout not seen since like decades and if we read about other high turnout elections in american history [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5005.5599999999995s)]
*  It was in something called the age of acrimony. That's a book. I really recommend which is what does that word mean? [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5012.2s)]
*  Acrimony is uh, no one is acrimonious would mean like, uh tension of fighting. It's a very uh, it's a [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5017.08s)]
*  Lackrimonizing means crying in latin acrimony would an acrimonious place would be [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5024.76s)]
*  It would be all of us yelling at each other [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5029.72s)]
*  The acrimony [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5035.72s)]
*  Age of acrimony is the 1890s and [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5054.2s)]
*  Unfortunately, that was also when the gilded age now. Why was america all up in arms at that time, bro? [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5056.9s)]
*  It wasn't just it wasn't really about class. That's when all the rich people really took advantage [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5062.6s)]
*  It was basically like should black people have civil rights or not. That was like the number one [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5066.4400000000005s)]
*  Animating issue of the south there's an entire thing called southern populism [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5070.9800000000005s)]
*  Which is basically just like whipping up poor white people against blacks so that you can prop up a new [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5075.0s)]
*  plantation class of rich people from the post civil war and [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5081.700000000001s)]
*  Even in the in the northeast like where we are here [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5085.88s)]
*  That's how the robber barons and all of them came to power and they funded a lot of this culture warfare and [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5088.44s)]
*  Benefited from it and it wasn't until teddie roosevelt and the progressive era started there was said no the real problem here is [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5094.36s)]
*  Combination is all of these standard oil trusts taking advantage of us and that was a complete reverse [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5100.58s)]
*  So it's a real way things slow down. So essentially what? [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5105.96s)]
*  What the what the southern populism was doing in the robber barons were doing essentially saying yo your life was way better [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5109.639999999999s)]
*  Back when no they had they had the population fighting over black civil rights [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5115.56s)]
*  So and the way they did it is said hey your life was way better when these black people didn't have all this right [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5120.04s)]
*  Yeah, exactly having all this rights in this upward mobility is taken away from you bingo [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5124.2s)]
*  And then roosevelt on some bernie sanders came in shit came in and was like yo, it's not about black and white [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5127.72s)]
*  It's about these billionaire motherfuckers. It was wilson. These guys came in that's what i'm saying [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5132.52s)]
*  The day I agree, but it's very difficult because the problem is they're in the fucking pockets. That's why it's difficult [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5136.44s)]
*  Well, not only pockets is not only they're controlled but they speak in the language of exactly the people [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5141.64s)]
*  No, they speak gay and and and it is true they do speak that well, I mean they're out of touch [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5148.52s)]
*  Everyone should go watch aoc's [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5152.68s)]
*  Uh 2020 dnc speech. He was like for black indigenous for you know [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5154.740000000001s)]

*  You see him in the ballet recital that is [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5167.0s)]
*  Oh black indigenous people of color, how have you not heard of this man? Come on. Well, this is old school. This is old school [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5170.92s)]
*  Yeah, I had never heard about that black indigenous people of color. That's right [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5176.76s)]
*  It keeps people like akash and i out fair enough mexicans. Oh, yeah, I thought we were people of color [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5181.4s)]
*  Huh, I thought we were people of color. It's black indigenous people [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5185.88s)]
*  No, it's only by pox [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5190.4400000000005s)]
*  It's not us. What's a black indigenous person of color? No, it's saying black and [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5192.68s)]
*  Indigenous people of color as in like it's a specific [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5197.22s)]
*  It's a way to keep people like us out like the asians and the mexicans [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5200.4400000000005s)]
*  This is interesting what this is [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5211.64s)]
*  This is a mirror image of what you just described [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5214.12s)]
*  Uh with the robert barons, they're exactly right. Yes. Yes. It's just [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5217.64s)]
*  Acrimonious like [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5225.160000000001s)]
*  Okay, I got that shit now, okay, so that's genius I guess you're so you're just flipping it and it does feel good [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5231.400000000001s)]
*  It does satisfy you in that moment. You're like, I don't have something. They're the reason why I don't have it, but they're [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5236.04s)]
*  Unable to execute the task at hand, which is really hey, there's a lot of people who got a lot of money [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5242.04s)]
*  They could be fucking indian. They could be white. They could be jewish [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5247.88s)]
*  They could be whatever the fuck they are and in order for you to get some money [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5250.2s)]
*  They're gonna have to have a little less of that money and influence potentially. Yeah, even if that's wrong [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5253.48s)]
*  Yeah, if they run on that it is so much more digestible and any credibility now [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5258.28s)]
*  Where do you get the cred from? That's the problem is that I think that aoc and a lot of these other people are so [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5263.24s)]
*  Uh, you know these statements in the past this would fuck [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5268.759999999999s)]
*  Kamala has been so fucked from those 2019 press conference and we need a health care for all illegal immigrants [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5271.88s)]
*  I'm like, yo, why don't we just start with health care for america? [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5278.92s)]
*  Why are you starting? [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5281.5599999999995s)]
*  No, but that's interesting because the second aoc runs for president they're gonna run the bipod [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5283.639999999999s)]
*  It'll be everywhere and you know what that will affect sorry go go go [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5288.839999999999s)]
*  This is where you're kind of fucked in a primary system where you have to appease the most extreme voters because they'll come out [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5291.5599999999995s)]
*  Yes, in the say the wild [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5296.36s)]
*  Yeah, and then as soon as you run generally people are gonna be like look what this bitch said [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5298.759999999999s)]
*  That's why I think the next democrat has to come from fucking no. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5302.679999999999s)]
*  That's what you guys think steven a [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5306.599999999999s)]
*  Real quick miles had a very interesting, uh take from what was it colin cowherd? Yeah, basically he said picture [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5309.24s)]
*  Lebron you say you think about lebron know like great passing great disc great that picture mj ultimate winner picture this guy [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5316.2s)]
*  Now he goes not picture jason tatum [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5322.759999999999s)]
*  Nothing and then you had a point from gilbert arenas that you were talking about earlier [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5324.92s)]
*  He said the league they just the league just won't give him they just won't get behind [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5328.4400000000005s)]
*  And I might be misquoting gilbert, but it seemed like he was trying to say the league won't get behind jason tatum [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5332.6s)]
*  Yeah, despite him having all the intangibles [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5337.24s)]
*  Yeah, like he got the skills. He got the ring. Yeah, I think he's just [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5339.64s)]
*  He's not likable. There's nothing like you don't like this guy [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5344.2s)]
*  He is I think I said this to you. Oh, yeah [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5348.2s)]
*  This is a postgame when he sell it when he won the championship finally [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5350.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he didn't play great and then his speech is just like copying everybody else's. Yeah, and I think everybody was like [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5353.24s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah, you're just light skin [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5359.64s)]
*  You're just like like so I agree with everything you're saying [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5361.88s)]
*  But the league does seem to get behind the guy who was suspended for shooting people because he's exciting [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5366.12s)]
*  So they don't really care about if you break the law anymore [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5372.84s)]
*  I guess not. I think we don't care and ever got a bunch of baby mamas [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5375.96s)]
*  He's trying to abort like the guys who are taking over the league [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5380.28s)]
*  They don't exactly fit the mold of what the league would get behind. Yes, say whatever you want about [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5384.5199999999995s)]
*  Michael jordan and like gambling nobody knew any of that shit. They kept it out of the news [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5390.44s)]
*  He was the face of the league and also he was never in trouble about anything. Is this lebron lebron? [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5394.599999999999s)]
*  Never citizen all things considered steph curry [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5400.36s)]
*  Model citizens real jason tatum is a model citizen. Yeah [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5402.84s)]
*  Why not give them the league because I I think the league reflects what we want to support so they're doing [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5407.0s)]
*  They're doing the wrestling thing now david stern would be like i'm going with who's the most professional and who's gonna be you know? [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5412.76s)]
*  Max the character of the league whereas adam silver is like what do the people fuck? [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5419.24s)]
*  Yeah, luca needs to go to the lakers. All right, we'll push that for us. Yeah [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5423.8s)]
*  Yeah, that trade might not get pushed through back in the day. We're just talking about that [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5427.96s)]
*  Wooden stick man shit, yeah, what is that? 100% what is tatum? [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5431.4s)]
*  What is tatum exceptional at he's very well rounded he's a great scorer good defender like well rounded he's good [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5437.08s)]
*  Unstoppable score but that's what i'm saying. Yeah. Oh if you say he's an unstoppable scorer, then maybe [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5443.48s)]
*  You go go. I just don't feel like he has something in his game [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5449.799999999999s)]
*  That's just so out of this world the way like all the other people you named [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5452.759999999999s)]
*  I think I think what alex saying rings true, which is like we relate to disruptive play [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5457.320000000001s)]
*  So steve curry was disruptive alan iverson was disruptive and lebron and edwards is disruptive lebron like [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5463.0s)]
*  Weirdly, I think lebron was so disruptive [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5470.42s)]
*  To be honest because of his uh passing ability too [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5473.64s)]
*  If he was just like a guy who's dunking on you same with luca exactly. Yes [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5477.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5482.120000000001s)]
*  But I also think if I think we're forgetting also luca's white i'll be honest with you like [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5483.16s)]
*  If luca's not white [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5488.28s)]
*  His style of play. I don't know how marketable he is. I think he's less marketable [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5490.44s)]
*  But if he was black, he would be in better shape. Yeah [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5495.88s)]
*  But do you hear what i'm saying like yeah, he's kind of like slow and plotting like [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5507.24s)]
*  It's easier to get behind that for a white guy you don't expect athletic I mean do we look at luca as [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5511.64s)]
*  Tim duncan if he's black. Yeah [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5517.08s)]
*  Isn't that interesting? Yeah, but tim yeah go. Yeah, no both talk shit. Actually tim duncan would talk [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5520.52s)]
*  I guess his shit talk was funny, but he'd be like nice try [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5526.6s)]
*  Okay, you ever heard kem garner talk about tim duncan would talk shit. He'd be like almost got me like a little [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5529.400000000001s)]
*  There you go. That was good effort. No, I will say tim duncan's in the post [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5535.320000000001s)]
*  It's a little bit more boring style of play like luca's doing step back three [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5538.2s)]
*  So the game is definitely changed but in terms of being like it's not very like [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5541.8s)]
*  like flash and excitement, yeah, he's really using speed [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5546.12s)]
*  and [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5550.44s)]
*  The ability to slow down and he's using his body weight to score and i'm trying to find a black player like that [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5551.88s)]
*  Huh? Hardin. No, hardin [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5558.599999999999s)]
*  Athleticism and just fucking I think his hardin got a little older and you know didn't take care of his body [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5561.22s)]
*  In the heyday of hardin, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's just [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5565.08s)]
*  I hate making that argument, but you have to calculate race in the somewhat and [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5568.84s)]
*  he's not like [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5574.44s)]
*  Excited like I don't want to shit on luca, but he's not like oh my god when you watch step back three [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5576.2s)]
*  He's god. Yeah fun, but not like steph, but I will say also [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5581.24s)]
*  I think the reason david stern cared more about character is the united states is more puritanical and cared more about character [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5584.28s)]
*  And now like now we don't give a fuck if you gamble and you fuck girls [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5590.2s)]
*  And yeah trump has shown us if you are funny and engaging we'll get behind you in this day and age [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5593.24s)]
*  So I think the league is like all right jason tatum you're a model citizen [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5598.44s)]
*  But you're not as funny and engaging as these other guys and that's who the people are getting behind [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5602.28s)]
*  So that's who we're getting behind. It's interesting and jordan's gambling issue [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5606.2s)]
*  I feel like the only issue is that he didn't do stake [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5609.0s)]
*  Yeah, because if he did stake like if he used like the leader in global betting in u.s social conceals [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5612.04s)]
*  Oh my gosh, he would love a social [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5617.639999999999s)]
*  That's the only reason the bronze better [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5621.08s)]
*  It's it is wait. No, i'm not I am not [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5623.88s)]
*  Almost got it now. I know that jordan did like to like take some time on his own [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5630.679999999999s)]

*  And enough like he has the communication skills and he has the star power because you do need the star power [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5668.36s)]
*  He has like that centrist like he's relatable because every all the men that like let's say voted for trump or masculinity [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5672.44s)]
*  Yeah, we'll see that in him. I totally agree 100. Yeah, but like he doesn't have like the [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5678.68s)]
*  emasculated [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5684.34s)]
*  This is gonna drive fucking democrats crazy [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5686.12s)]
*  But like they do have this deep insecurity about looking emasculated like I said that thing on fucking on on brilliant [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5688.84s)]
*  It's where I was like, I don't know like a guy who identifies as a democrat over five nine and that fucking [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5695.08s)]
*  I've never seen so many people and I think it was just emblematic of this feeling like [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5702.4400000000005s)]
*  People going they think we're what they think we're bitches. Yeah, that's right. And and so deep down they have that's so funny [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5707.48s)]
*  Because I'll pretend these five eleven [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5713.32s)]
*  That wasn't always the case [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5721.4s)]
*  Insult the conservatives the conservatives when I was growing up got no pussy [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5729.48s)]
*  They work [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5738.12s)]
*  Clinton was head in the office. That's right. Like Democrats were the ones that were actually cracking she they're winning a culture war [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5746.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5753.36s)]
*  That is kind of flipped because the Democrats now have to be like so concerned now Stephen a doesn't have that [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5755.92s)]
*  He's out here like that's why I seen this got big asses and I like latinas. So I gotta make he has no chance [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5761.12s)]

*  Out of no way because he didn't vote for Iraq like you have to have somebody who's got [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5771.32s)]
*  Credibility, you have to have somebody who doesn't give a fuck [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5777.28s)]
*  Trump had but yeah, but [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5781.16s)]
*  Let me take away no chance. Yeah, he has a chance. He has a chance [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5783.679999999999s)]
*  I need to see some I need to see some credibility like like I think what worked for Trump [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5786.719999999999s)]
*  Even if it doesn't even make sense [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5793.0s)]
*  But we could bridge the gap like the cognitive dissonance in our brain [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5795.08s)]
*  Evaporated when when we're like, well, he's made these deals. He likes making deals. Yeah, he could make deals abroad [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5799.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I need to see Stephen a I need to believe that Stephen a could talk to Putin [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5806.36s)]
*  Talk to Kim Jong and make some deals go through and I understand what I'm saying. That's sounds crazy [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5811.2s)]
*  But a lot of no, I understand that what I could help him in the primary is I think he can't beat [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5816.28s)]
*  the [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5822.5199999999995s)]
*  Primary yes, he's good at arguing. Yes. He doesn't give a fuck [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5824.8s)]
*  Dude, he goes on and see them actually doing whatever a public doesn't give a fuck [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5828.44s)]
*  Yeah, I like that and then maybe in the election the general you say I don't know if he can do yes politics diplomatic shit [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5831.8s)]
*  What I'm watching him on Hannity [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5837.5199999999995s)]
*  All politicians need this you need a love of the game dude, and Stephen has he likes the love of yeah [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5839.92s)]
*  I mean think about it like you want to give up like your wife [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5845.48s)]
*  Your wife and your children's future to be in a Secret Service bubble like do you know how narcissistic you have to be? [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5848.76s)]
*  Yeah, actually pursue this like you have to be kind of fucking crazy. I won't do another podcast a week. That's what I'm saying [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5854.12s)]
*  And that's normal [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5862.599999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't do it but having spent some time around these people like the burning need desire attention to say you need a black hole [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5866.04s)]
*  inside your chest [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5872.72s)]
*  Like and when you read all these guys Clinton you're like, oh he had four stepfathers [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5875.04s)]
*  They used to beat the shit out of his mom. And what did he need? [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5879.04s)]
*  He needed affirmation from women from people so he's always running freshman year. He runs for president JFK [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5881.4400000000005s)]
*  Same thing is like watch out his insanity at home and all this [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5887.16s)]
*  He needs women the way that his father needed women [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5890.08s)]
*  He needed the love of the people as the second son [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5892.88s)]
*  Yeah, did you always say that I was no that was a FK [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5898.400000000001s)]
*  Oh [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5904.72s)]
*  Truck is going on if we're being honest like Trump's entire entire desires what please his father [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5918.240000000001s)]
*  That is that edible like need is like deep and yeah, yeah, what about I mean even has that what about John Stewart? [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5924.68s)]
*  Yeah, I would love it I think he's brilliant and I think he's a great critic I don't know if he has that I don't know [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5932.400000000001s)]
*  If he has that same love of the game and I mean again, we have to think about what are you giving up? [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5939.080000000001s)]
*  I'm giving up every human being you will give up everything forever John is a great communicator, but I don't think that he has that same [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5943.68s)]
*  Desire to play me to be my this is also a coalitional sport [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5951.72s)]
*  You have to say something and then meet with somebody who totally disagrees with you and then go on a stage and be like [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5955.52s)]
*  We're the best friends ever right like that requires kind of some self-hatred and like some weird shit to do [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5960.72s)]
*  Like an absorb all of that [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5967.12s)]
*  And I think John is almost too honest and like too good of a guy and that's why that's why he has our trust [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5968.52s)]
*  He has I love John. I was a lot of trust that we need but you're right [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5974.04s)]
*  He might not have that deep black hole. Yes, that is needed to go out there and give everything [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5977.88s)]
*  Are you saying he couldn't win or you're saying he would never run? [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5984.2s)]
*  either I mean and and [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5987.92s)]
*  I don't know man. I'm a critic nom. Yes, you have to put yeah, that's different [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5991.68s)]
*  But like and actually even then I'm still not quite sure like what you need [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=5996.08s)]
*  You need a fighter like look at the liberal energy right now [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6000.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean frankly like I kind of make fun of them because they're like these guys are going viral and from town halls [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6004.06s)]
*  They're like get up there and get yourself arrested in the Department of Education [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6008.92s)]
*  Like bro, what the fuck is that do? [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6012.22s)]
*  That make you feel bad that you like lifted his voice in octaves [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6014.88s)]
*  No [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6020.72s)]
*  That's a problem [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6025.4800000000005s)]
*  And I know I have some bias but like they have to and yes, I am very much [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6028.72s)]
*  But I speak about this like purely culturally like they have to address that issue [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6033.04s)]
*  So that they can become more relatable and I think Stephen a addresses that there's no guy [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6038.400000000001s)]
*  That looks at Stephen a and thinks of like an emasculated. Yeah, he's not a bitch. Yeah, I'm just like you're not [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6042.4400000000005s)]
*  A clip I know you've seen this is where John Stewart. I don't think wants to but he would win Tucker Carlson [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6047.8s)]
*  God is 2000 got his high voice out talking all this ranting and raving. Yeah, and I know that's your boy [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6054.08s)]
*  I don't like but then John just goes Tucker you wear a bowtie done [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6060.200000000001s)]
*  I do that's the shit Trump does when Trump is in a debate and he just gets you Oh John by occupation [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6065.0s)]
*  Yes, we'll do that a lot of these guys when John wants to when when remember when he destroyed was it Jim Cramer? [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6071.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6076.759999999999s)]
*  Like you have the stating take that was like [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6079.679999999999s)]
*  He was like almost crying [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6083.12s)]
*  It was like the moment where everyone realized oh wow this yeah exactly. I mean look I I like John [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6088.679999999999s)]
*  I think he could do well [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6093.96s)]
*  Stephen to me reads with a liberal base wants another and by the way, though when I said the Democratic base [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6095.44s)]
*  I didn't get to finish [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6100.9s)]
*  Like elderly black people are the absolute like most loyal people to the Democratic Party [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6102.56s)]
*  Remember they showed up for Jim Clyburn and Joe Biden. They saved Joe Biden's ass in South Carolina [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6108.4800000000005s)]
*  They're the people who gave Obama the presidency after he won in the Iowa caucuses basically put him on the path to victory [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6114.280000000001s)]
*  So I think Stephen embodies their like want to fight and like the fight is the same thing for Trump like Trump [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6120.8s)]
*  Animated the Republican base and all of these working-class whites were like he's standing up for us against these corrupt [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6128.56s)]
*  Ivy League fucks who I fucking hate. Yeah, so his mere existence [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6135.12s)]
*  Yeah, his his occupation of the Oval Office is enough for me to see these people [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6139.16s)]
*  Scream to tire to go out to the streets that you know [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6143.84s)]
*  It's the Eric Hartman licking Scott Peterson's tears, you know from South Park where he's like, oh Scott [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6147.4800000000005s)]

*  They make fun of black women [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6158.04s)]
*  That's that's what Trump is to me and like yeah [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6164.72s)]
*  This is part of the problem for the Democrats is when you have a group that is [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6167.88s)]
*  Explicitly hatred of your leaders of your call of the cultural elite of which you are one no matter what you think you have a huge [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6172.400000000001s)]
*  Messaging problem. That's part of reason why I think that Stephen could be powerful though because he's [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6179.88s)]
*  Convincing that in the same way and he gets some of the sports fans from the other side [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6184.24s)]
*  Yeah, think about his name ID forever. It's cool [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6191.04s)]
*  You went from no chance [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6198.16s)]

*  The fact you said no chance makes me think he has a chance [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6212.68s)]
*  But if it's a lot more smart for you [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6219.16s)]
*  Okay, so yeah, wow, that's that's really interesting and I think it solves a bunch of problems [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6222.76s)]
*  It's always the masculinity issue. It's all centrist trust. Yeah, 100% [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6227.240000000001s)]

*  Like Clinton said the most depressed he ever was when he had to leave the White House like that's who they are [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6252.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, we need to stop at a red light for the first time like that's that's [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6257.6s)]
*  I [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6260.64s)]
*  Before that every day he was going home to his daughter. Yes looking at him as he's having this cheating scandal [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6268.400000000001s)]
*  He's got a talk to her. He's got a lie to the entire country [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6274.88s)]
*  I have to leave all of that. Yes, I have to leave [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6279.96s)]
*  I know he was like first time I walked into a room [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6283.32s)]
*  That's genius, the most depressing [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6285.32s)]
*  Now I have to look my daughter in the eye and have to get my dick sucked by the internet [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6287.32s)]
*  That was fun [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6291.32s)]
*  I'm getting peaked, that's fine [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6293.32s)]
*  He's like I'd walk in a room. They wouldn't play Hailed to the Chief. I didn't know what was going on [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6295.32s)]
*  It's like I know what I'm doing [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6299.32s)]
*  That's insane dude [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6301.32s)]
*  That's who they are [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6303.32s)]
*  And listen they're great, you know, that's why we need them [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6305.32s)]
*  We need somebody else to absorb all this bullshit [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6307.32s)]
*  The rest of us want to go to our daughter's gymnastics class [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6309.32s)]
*  That's a great observation from obviously being you know years in politics and understanding like the constitution of the person that's gonna do the job [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6312.12s)]
*  They do need that burning desire for approval and the need to fight [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6319.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that is wow. I think Steven has that and that's why when I look at I don't I [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6324.639999999999s)]
*  Kamala of course never had no she had the narcissism and all of that to pursue it, but she didn't have she wasn't a star [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6330.24s)]
*  She just was she couldn't convey that she couldn't combine that I guess for greatness [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6336.24s)]
*  She's got horrible baggage [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6342.2s)]
*  Who else is there anybody else any other outsider that's interesting? [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6344.5599999999995s)]
*  I would have made a case for Dean Phillips the guy who ran against Biden in the primary [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6347.4s)]
*  Only because he has the Obama he has the same thing Obama had in oh, too [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6351.44s)]
*  So in oh to Obama fucking nobody literally gives a speech in outside the state Senate against the Iraq War [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6356.12s)]
*  Dean is the only [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6362.799999999999s)]
*  Establishment Democrat who can credibly say I called out Biden's age before it was obvious to the world [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6365.16s)]
*  Because he ran against Biden in the New Hampshire primary. He's made some weird like moves since then [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6371.32s)]
*  The other thing is Dean is filthy rich. So that's that helps right? You can self-fund a campaign [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6376.24s)]
*  You can get your name ID out there [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6380.24s)]
*  But again, he's the same Obama thing of I told the truth when it was uncomfortable [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6382.36s)]
*  He even didn't even run for Congress again [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6387.32s)]
*  Like he lost his political future and got blown out in the primary on a single message of we cannot win with Biden and he [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6389.679999999999s)]
*  Was empirically correct. So I think Dean [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6396.12s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if the Democrats will reward him in the same way, but [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6398.7s)]
*  Buttigieg, I mean he wants it. He's desperate. He has the need he has the black. I like but his problem is he's he's got the baggage [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6403.179999999999s)]
*  Dude, he's got that 2020 primary stage. I do raising my hands for illegal health care and all this [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6410.08s)]
*  It's like dude that stuff is just cancer. Here's what I would say about him. Yeah, here's what I'd say about booty judge [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6415.74s)]
*  He will engage the other side and I think that is refreshing [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6421.34s)]
*  The appearance of a gift have the appearance of yeah on Fox News, you know what? You're right. He loves the game, too [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6425.7s)]
*  He loves to go on Fox. He likes to combat with Sam Smith or whatever. He's smart. Huh? Yeah, well, he's the appearance of smart [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6430.3s)]
*  But yes [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6435.78s)]
*  That's important. That's important. Yeah [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6436.78s)]
*  Let's talk about that. Yeah, the appearance of smart is more valuable than actual intellect [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6439.18s)]
*  absolutely when it comes to running for public office, no question Michael Bloomberg is [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6445.38s)]
*  Objectively smarter than everybody on that stage. Yeah, he could not communicate that intelligence [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6450.58s)]
*  In a way that was effective in convincing us now [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6455.06s)]
*  We loved him as mayor in New York right mayor in New York his second most powerful position in the land [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6457.620000000001s)]
*  Like let's just be honest like you are the mayor of New York. You're really the president like I don't really [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6461.42s)]
*  Eric Adams is the president [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6469.820000000001s)]
*  This is the proof right mayor Adams the entire state comes after him right what's happening right now what happened to that what nothing [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6476.34s)]
*  Charges dropped because you're the real president [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6484.9s)]
*  When your president [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6494.18s)]
*  Stopped a real point because you got to defend New York [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6501.22s)]
*  I [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6503.86s)]
*  Would be nice to have like shitlib stand up for their city because there is like this weird [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6511.86s)]
*  Because you guys notice this I'm sure to shit live like just like somebody who's [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6517.299999999999s)]
*  No [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6523.0199999999995s)]
*  To me is is like the classic the pink hair the pussy hat like that [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6525.74s)]
*  But for me it's like there is something annoying somebody call them the coffee party [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6529.94s)]
*  No you and some guy in like Alabama's like man crime in New York is out of control and you're like dude shut the fuck [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6544.0199999999995s)]
*  Dangerous it's always been dangerous. Yeah, I mean it's also not that it's not something empirically. It's just like not [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6553.5s)]
*  Worse for sure for them. Yeah, fair enough. If you live in a suburb sure [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6559.1s)]
*  But any city is dangerous for anybody who lives in this but that's what I'm saying. Like the Delta is minimal [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6563.02s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6567.42s)]
*  I totally agree [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6568.02s)]
*  My point is just I do think there would be something people need to stand up for America cities because I think what's unfortunate [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6568.66s)]
*  Right now is that a lot of Republicans have like Psy op themselves, especially younger guys [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6574.1s)]
*  Like they don't want to come move to a city anymore [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6579.02s)]
*  And I'm like no like the city is the greatest place that you should move to that's where commerce connection was we're gonna meet everybody [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6580.860000000001s)]
*  You're young you can meet your wife. Whatever like that's where you can get shit done. You can go out [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6586.66s)]
*  You can have a good time. You can move to start later. This is where shit happens. This is where you can [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6590.76s)]
*  Like I want somebody to stand up and this is like almost a liberal like I'm also gonna stand up for fucking America cities [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6602.58s)]
*  I want like Chicago. I'm doing it right now. Just called me a cop [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6607.98s)]
*  No, I'm saying it's a good thing [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6611.42s)]
*  In a more credible way, what's it like actually crimes? This is like no bitch like don't be a pussy is fucking awesome [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6614.26s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I hear the issue. Don't they get identified as city elites and who can't relate? [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6621.26s)]
*  We think we're better [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6631.26s)]
*  We don't even consider you from here. We treat everybody who moves in New York like an immigrant [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6634.3s)]
*  We go there you go, I'm from New York we go. Well, when did you move here? [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6639.900000000001s)]
*  But that pisses off the rest of the country [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6647.34s)]
*  I'll be pissed off if I live where y'all live to [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6651.54s)]
*  Travel the country. I know it's like we are elite and it's good to worry. I agree there needs to be this confidence moving again [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6655.14s)]
*  That's what I'm saying 100% get the migrants out [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6661.1s)]
*  Everybody from Maine [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6666.780000000001s)]
*  Everybody from Pennsylvania [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6669.14s)]
*  You know the problem with the coffee party though is [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6680.18s)]
*  Self-loathing is intrinsic to their existence. That's exactly they cannot exist without hating themselves and everything about this [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6683.34s)]
*  So I have to hate New York City, even though I live here [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6689.46s)]
*  I have to hate America even though I live here because I hate myself [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6692.18s)]
*  So can I ask you a question? [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6695.22s)]
*  Does it come from and I'm curious about this does it come from actual self-hatred or does it come from a need to be? [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6697.820000000001s)]
*  Liked and accepted and the feeling of if I shit on my existence [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6704.5s)]
*  These minorities might accept me aren't those kind of one in the same doesn't one feed into the other [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6709.740000000001s)]
*  Again, I don't know chicken or the egg [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6715.7s)]
*  But I don't think that they're doing it just because they hate themselves [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6717.06s)]
*  They might hate themselves, but they desperately care about the approved because people who hate themselves [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6720.06s)]
*  They just kill themselves and it's like [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6723.9s)]
*  But if you just have this pure hatred for self, yeah [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6735.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but I don't you feel like sometimes there's like this like need of approval the appearance of self-loathing [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6737.62s)]
*  Yeah, it is diametrically opposed. I told you stand up for a big city [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6743.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, when you're like your whole existence appears to be shit on everything that is of my existence [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6745.78s)]
*  Might be education like there's this guilt that is like in ingrained in you in the college system right like America's bad [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6751.34s)]
*  You know, it's like the existence of the country's bad [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6757.9800000000005s)]
*  Like the things that we do are awful and there's like this thing that gets embedded in within you [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6759.820000000001s)]
*  whereas like a working-class kids or whatever built with much more patriotism both in the home and probably just [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6764.14s)]
*  Around like the way that they think about things [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6770.34s)]
*  I think we do bad stuff, but it's a great place [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6772.78s)]
*  The easiest way to deal with privilege is to apologize for it and not actually do anything great great to apologize [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6774.74s)]
*  Yeah, whereas people like I didn't grow a poor by any stretch, but I feel like I worked up [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6781.320000000001s)]
*  I started a comedy, but so I don't feel like I have to apologize for this [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6785.96s)]
*  Yes, if I my kids god willing I'm successful. I wanted they might feel a little bit apologetic [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6789.160000000001s)]
*  I didn't earn this so you know what instead of actually like going on doing community service [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6794.0s)]
*  Why don't just apologize all for my existence? [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6797.76s)]
*  And I think that's a lot of times why those guys are the loudest ones in Democratic Party and they've taken control of the narrative [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6799.76s)]
*  Well, a lot of it is also about like this this need for control [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6805.8s)]
*  Like that's where I think that if you were talking about how the right wasn't cool and the mid-2000s like cuz they were trying [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6809.14s)]
*  To tell people what to do. Yeah, the modern right has basically become a socially libertarian, right? [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6814.46s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't think he likes when I say this but I've for years [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6819.38s)]
*  I've been like I think Dave Portnoy is one of the most important political figures in the country. He would love this [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6822.54s)]
*  No, he would not [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6826.46s)]
*  I don't think he likes it because I think what I always say is like barstool [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6827.58s)]
*  Republicanism is the new basically wave of conservatism in America, which is you do what you want to do [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6831.02s)]
*  But don't fucking tell me how to speak right because I think Dave would love that and I don't know [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=6837.179999999999s)]

*  So do we do you think that we got to something from dotes? I think we did I think so [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7658.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7663.58s)]
*  I also think I honestly think a lot of democrats should listen to this and if you're a democrat or whatever out there [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7664.0599999999995s)]
*  You should send it to people because you know, it's also funny. Yeah, I try like [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7668.22s)]
*  I try to I mean we have the conversation with brilliance other time [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7672.860000000001s)]
*  We talk about here and what I realized is I got to go on more [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7675.18s)]
*  Uh, I was telling you this I have to go on many more left-leaning shows and I realized this [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7678.38s)]
*  even when I was doing some press for for the pod is that one those conversations are so much better because there's [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7683.18s)]
*  There's a perception I guess of me [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7689.34s)]
*  And once they actually have a conversation. They think you're literally mago. They literally think you're mago. People ask me that of course [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7692.22s)]
*  I don't know what you're talking about. But I have empathy for them [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7697.9800000000005s)]
*  No, I have empathy because i'm sure like the way I think of anybody who i've only you know [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7700.86s)]
*  Seen a headline of and then I see like one little clip of but in in my mind like we do [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7705.18s)]
*  We kind of work really hard to make sure that we have diversity and guests here. I'm obviously never a woman, but right but [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7709.9800000000005s)]
*  In terms of the male guests, right? We have a lot of diversity [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7716.3s)]
*  But all that does is just reminds our base that we care about these different opinions than we have these conversations, right? [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7719.18s)]
*  I could be on a podcast with charlomane who's literally riding so hard for the democrats and comma [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7725.82s)]
*  It doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is when you go into their territory and have those discussions [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7731.0199999999995s)]
*  And then they get a different sense of you. That's interesting. And I think that's what works so well with john [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7736.14s)]
*  I think when john would go on fox news [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7740.22s)]
*  It's not about having the fox news guys on his program. He would go over there [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7742.62s)]
*  Because you're going into the lion's den. Yeah, you call the lines, but then they get a sense of you [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7746.38s)]
*  So it's something that I realized I'm gonna make more of an effort and we should all do [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7751.18s)]
*  Going on other pods. I assume just having diversity of guests over here all those people listen, they don't know [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7755.1s)]
*  It's our listeners. How much content is out there? Exactly. How much other shit do you know? You're right? [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7760.9400000000005s)]
*  You're 100% right. Yeah, you're 100% right. Anyway, you were saying oh man, I don't fucking remember [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7765.74s)]
*  I'm trying to think about okay. How do you feel about pat ryan? You think you have a chance of running pat ryan? [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7769.58s)]
*  Yeah, who am I? I don't know. He's a black guy probably no, he's actually not really [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7775.26s)]
*  Oh the representative. Yeah, yeah [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7780.06s)]
*  He [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7782.620000000001s)]
*  That's interesting I um, I think he's got too much baggage french laundry is just so fucked [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7787.660000000001s)]
*  It's so bad. He's got the same problem. Can you explain that to everybody who doesn't know? [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7793.820000000001s)]
*  Oh, sorry. He dined at the french which is like one of the three star michelin restaurants. I think it's samas keller, right? [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7798.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he dined at the french laundry [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7803.900000000001s)]
*  He was indoor dining when all of rest of california had non-indoor dining during covid. It was a huge scandal, rightfully [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7805.900000000001s)]
*  It was ridiculous to shut down all these businesses. I think shit like that. He reads to me as too elitist [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7811.18s)]
*  He's got too much of the baggage and he's also trying too hard. He just started his new podcast. I'm like [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7817.34s)]
*  Like again, he gives me the fucking ick. Yeah, like you know with uh, I agree with with how desperate he's contorting himself [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7822.9400000000005s)]
*  It's just too much. That's why again I come back to my it has to be an outsider [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7828.9400000000005s)]
*  The way trump broke the republican party has to come from outside [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7832.14s)]
*  It's obama like the state the perception the state could be flourishing [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7835.18s)]
*  But the perception of the state from the outside is that it's struggling. I mean empirically they lost what half a million people [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7838.78s)]
*  It's just true. But even if even if they were doing really well [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7843.82s)]
*  Totally, yeah, the perception is so important and not being able to control that perception [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7848.139999999999s)]
*  I guess what he shouldn't be doing is starting his own pod. He should be going on rogan [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7852.78s)]
*  Yes, he should be going on any right-leaning pod that he possibly can. Plus he's afraid like they're you know [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7856.139999999999s)]
*  And that's the funny thing about that is that people have done rogan. I'm like dude [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7861.58s)]
*  He's not gonna attack you like shut the hell up. He's gonna fucking talk to you and try to understand [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7864.22s)]
*  Fetterman talk and that guy fucking talk [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7867.9s)]
*  And to be honest, I think if federman didn't have that stroke, I think he would have a chance for the democrat [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7872.3s)]
*  Maybe he's he was he was uh, he was very talented and he's the clothing thing drives me. Fuck [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7876.06s)]
*  I know drives you crazy, but it reads yeah, it reads every man blue collar [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7879.98s)]
*  Not super cucky social to a democrat it reads a blue collar democrat. It reads like that's our guy. I don't know [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7884.06s)]
*  Okay, he's like the costume [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7889.74s)]
*  I thought it I thought that exact thing until I saw him at the inauguration [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7891.74s)]
*  Yeah, still wearing the sweatpants and the shorts and I was like, oh [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7896.32s)]
*  You're just putting on an outfit so that working-class people will think that's how I feel [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7900.24s)]
*  Yeah, and now it lost all inauthentic. It was all I'm glad you felt that way. It felt so inauthentic [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7905.68s)]
*  I really believed it until that moment. Okay, you knew the inauguration's happening. You can rent a suit for 50 [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7909.92s)]
*  Bro, he wore a suit when bb visited the senate. It's like what the fuck, you know, so it's like you can't [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7915.2s)]
*  I'm just saying it's true [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7919.52s)]
*  They wore sue when bb came to america [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7921.52s)]
*  They don't wear a fucking suit when the united states president is being inaugurated like come on what the conspiracy theorists are saying about that [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7923.68s)]
*  Okay, he can wear the suit when he wants to okay. Okay. Okay. We have a very boring [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7930.72s)]
*  Reveal about the epstein list. Yeah, right [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7938.240000000001s)]
*  Can you explain or any of anybody who knows here? I haven't really been keeping up to date on it. Why was it? [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7942.400000000001s)]
*  Underwhelming and what is the future of the epstein? [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7949.18s)]
*  Well, it was all publicly available and the rollout was a disaster. Like let's just you know, like can you discuss that? [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7952.16s)]
*  Why it was disseminated in that way? I I according to the people there they would not expect it to be photographed immediately. So let's [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7957.36s)]
*  For people who haven't even seen all this. Here's what happened is a bunch of conservative influencers or whatever were at the white house [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7964.08s)]
*  They were given binders that said the epstein files on them. They come out of the white house [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7969.92s)]
*  They're photographed and tweets start going around of them holding up binders that say the epstein files people are like [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7973.28s)]
*  Hey, hold on a second. Why are you giving this to some conservative journalists? [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7978.32s)]
*  Like this is supposed to be just posted online for everybody, right? [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7982.16s)]
*  So then they were defending it. Uh, the other thing is it starts to leak out that [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7986.0s)]
*  Everything in there is already publicly available information [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7990.08s)]
*  The only new thing that came out of the epstein files was a claim by the attorney general that the fbi [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7992.799999999999s)]
*  Is currently covering things up, but like that's just a claim that's not a file, right? [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=7999.36s)]
*  So there's redacted info. They actually redacted some stuff which is publicly available already [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8003.5199999999995s)]
*  Less fucking hilarious. So like in some ways there's actually less information in this and they also the house judiciary committee [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8008.48s)]
*  Uh gop posted a link being like here's the epstein files and it was a literal rickroll [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8015.759999999999s)]
*  Like they a link to rickrolling and it was like dude [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8020.4s)]
*  We're talking about children who were sex trafficked like a dangerous pedophile like you're turning this into a meme [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8023.759999999999s)]
*  And the whole point is not a meme. It's like you never joke around about it. Nobody [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8029.599999999999s)]
*  Make jokes about if you're a professional comedian you can talk about it. If you're the house judiciary [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8033.52s)]
*  Yeah, maybe not. You're like, uh, like this is actually serious. This is like real shit [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8038.0s)]
*  So like what does all this shit mean? Like I mean first of all [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8042.96s)]
*  I'm starting to doubt whether the epstein file is real like whether it even exists like at this point [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8046.88s)]
*  Why would the fbi and I mean they burned all the jfk stuff [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8051.68s)]
*  They burned all the a lot of the ufo stuff where they've covered it up like is it even in physical format? [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8054.240000000001s)]

*  That bill gates is asking this dude for marriage advice or whatever [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8071.44s)]
*  Why did epstein have the connection to get bill gates a nobel prize? [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8075.599999999999s)]
*  I'm like, I think we know the only thing that needs to be declassified is some of the intelligence connection [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8078.719999999999s)]
*  Which they admitted was part of the reason that they pushed through the 2007 [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8084.0s)]
*  plea deal with epstein and so [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8089.04s)]
*  anyway, my epstein files is get alex acosta who was the [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8091.280000000001s)]

*  Who called you from the cia because he gave a quote back at that time where he said somebody [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8104.400000000001s)]
*  Intelligence called me and told me massage or cia. Oh nobody knows [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8110.38s)]
*  Cia [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8114.96s)]
*  Yes, the intelligence told me to let it go. That's right. They said let it go with that's what he said that [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8117.5199999999995s)]

*  I'm saying this is my solution. Yeah, first of all, it's a great solution [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8139.5199999999995s)]
*  I also think i'm not saying these people are going to be heroes. I don't think there's any world where gilain's a hero, right? [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8144.08s)]
*  uh alex acosta [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8150.08s)]

*  It cost him the secretary of labor if he does it if he goes out and does it [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8163.52s)]
*  And then somebody kills him afterwards [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8168.08s)]
*  He'll at least die. Yeah, i would die hero dude. I sat next to him on a plane [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8170.64s)]
*  I'm still ashamed of myself and didn't ask dude [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8174.4s)]
*  It was like it was like a night at 11 15 pm flight from miami and it was dead silent and I was just like [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8176.8s)]

*  I it's one of the great regrets of my life. I didn't you don't want to know who's on the list [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8198.56s)]
*  No, I don't i'm not sure the list as we understand it exists [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8201.92s)]
*  I think a lot of the list is let's say if it does bro the list as yes [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8205.92s)]
*  He wants to know the list of course [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8208.88s)]
*  But i'm saying the list we already know leon black the head of apollo group who had to resign the most powerful private equity [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8210.4s)]
*  Firm in the world fucking dershowitz like who else aude barack bill clinton kevin spacey gilain maxwell [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8216.64s)]
*  Every person who was ever out there reed hoffman [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8224.32s)]
*  All of these folks it's like it's out there it's public record and they all give us this or les wexner actually [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8227.119999999999s)]
*  That's another one. We need he needs to get immunity too. We're like less how old is he fucking 90 years old or something? [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8231.92s)]
*  We're like just say it dude. Tell us what tell us what the back. What were you? [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8237.359999999999s)]
*  Why what the fuck was going on? Yeah, that's what I think so alex acosta is the key figure if we give him immunity [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8241.52s)]
*  I don't even trust gilain to be honest with you. Yeah fair because she's too incentivized to lie exactly [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8248.24s)]
*  So I think it's acosta acosta says [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8253.6s)]
*  What intelligence told him or whatever it is? Yes, maybe then you give him you needed gilain to just figure out exactly what's going on [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8256.56s)]
*  But I think I think that that would pacify the american curiosity [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8263.52s)]
*  Yeah, it should it might not satisfy us, but we'd at least go. Okay [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8269.68s)]
*  We need to get cash betel on the show when you're gonna get him [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8273.039999999999s)]
*  But that's my thing is I don't even know if cash could it's people say this [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8275.439999999999s)]
*  I'm sure you're a ufo guy too people are always like oh does the government have the truth about ufos? [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8278.8s)]
*  I'm like yes, but not in the way that you think man like it's not it's way more boring [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8282.8s)]
*  It's just like it's all within layers and the radar blip bro [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8286.64s)]
*  If you're into jfk stuff too like you know this already you're like look we already have it like we know what is it what happened [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8290.56s)]
*  Or we already know that the cia assassin or was complicit in an assassination plot against john f kennedy [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8295.84s)]
*  That's all on the record all of the official evidence [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8301.439999999999s)]
*  It doesn't matter we know about the bay of pigs about the elements within the cia were upset about getting caught up [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8303.359999999999s)]
*  Jack Rue all of it. This is this is like it's been proven [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8309.599999999999s)]
*  It's been decades right where we can lay out all the holes in the official narrative magic bullet, right? [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8312.8s)]
*  Like it's all bullshit, but is there a file in the cia that's like we killed john f kennedy [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8317.359999999999s)]
*  No, you will find is you will find a file talking about these cuban elements or whatever who had access to stockpiles [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8321.92s)]
*  And maybe just like 9-eleven where the fbi had knowledge or the cia had knowledge of these people being in the country [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8328.96s)]
*  But didn't do anything about it that it was more like yeah, we were aware [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8335.2s)]
*  We didn't think they were doing things serious or whatever and then we're like, oh my god [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8338.320000000002s)]
*  We're gonna cover this shit up immediately like that's kind of how it all went down [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8341.44s)]
*  So so a lot of information is there like on charlie manson read the chaos book. It's there like we know what's the charlie manson thing [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8345.44s)]
*  That's that would take me hours to explain [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8352.0s)]
*  But the charles manson chaos highly recommend the book tom o'neill spent 20 years on it charlie manson was a cia asset [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8353.84s)]
*  He was part of the mind control experiments by the same guy who? [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8359.68s)]
*  Who wiped jack ruby's mind jolly swift jolly swift that's or yeah, that's right [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8362.96s)]
*  He was the lsd cia advisor on all of those like brothel plans jolly west [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8366.64s)]
*  That's his name jolly west jolly west was the person feeding lsd to charlie the manson family and all that was part in an fbi [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8372.0s)]
*  Plot to instigate like a race war part [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8378.4s)]
*  That's one of the things that they wrote on the uh on roman palanski's wall [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8380.4s)]
*  Was trying to instigate this and it was all part of this crazy shit that was going on inside of the fbi [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8384.16s)]
*  At that time we know this we know all of this even from the church committee onward [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8389.119999999999s)]
*  But it's like people think that there's smoking guns [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8392.8s)]
*  It's just like that's not how it works like with mlk with with manson with jfk ufo, etc [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8395.039999999999s)]
*  Like it's all covered up and the real smoking gun stuff. Those people are dead [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8400.24s)]
*  And I think the crazy part about the manson stuff is that even on their deathbeds. They still won't tell the truth [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8404.08s)]
*  Who's that? Who's that? The cops involved the fbi all of there's been foot fly. Why do you think I don't know man? [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8409.199999999999s)]
*  I don't know. I I genuinely don't know. I think [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8415.359999999999s)]
*  Either the information it's not that it would be too shocking [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8418.88s)]
*  It's just that don't let it ever be confirmed because only weirdos like me ever read the book and come on a show here [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8421.199999999999s)]
*  And tell you about it, right? It's like most people just move on with their lives. Like yeah, whatever manson is still alive [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8426.32s)]
*  You know what's going on there is it possible watch the tarantino movie? [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8431.199999999999s)]
*  You know, it's like that's it. Is it possible that the like extreme conspiracy theories are [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8433.919999999998s)]
*  Uh, I don't know what the term for this would be but they're developed [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8438.88s)]
*  By the people that are hiding the truth people think that yeah a lot of people what is that called? I mean like [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8442.24s)]
*  So so the idea is like get people controlled opposition. Yeah, so get people to think that's a fake one [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8449.18s)]
*  An even crazier thing happened. Yes, say the term conspiracy theorist. Yeah, is it is it op? [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8454.16s)]
*  You're exactly right. It was created as a style. So so so so let's just say what people say best case scenario [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8459.68s)]
*  This is just best. No, I don't even know if it's the best case but a scenario [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8464.16s)]
*  Uh fbi is aware. Yeah, choose not to intervene [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8467.68s)]
*  Really bad thing happens later. The fbi goes fuck if people know that we were aware [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8471.68s)]
*  This is on me and the guy was only on the job for one week on 9 11. Oh weird [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8476.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he's like, why would he have any incentive to cover that up? Right? [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8480.64s)]
*  So we go shit if I don't cover this up, it's going to come down to all of us [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8483.6s)]
*  We're all going to lose our jobs. Correct. And then you go to all your constituents you hey guys [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8486.880000000001s)]
*  If we don't cover this shit up, this is on us. So [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8490.24s)]
*  Let them think an even crazier thing happened or we put that idea out there in the world [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8493.04s)]
*  Because the truth is kind of boring and it's ineptitude which is oftentimes howkins that's exactly what happened [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8497.6s)]
*  That's what 9 11 was it was complete cluster. But dude, we've had the information since oh five laurence [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8502.800000000001s)]
*  Right the looming tower everybody should read that book that book lays out exactly how the fbi [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8507.44s)]
*  And the cia had everything they needed to stop 9 11. It didn't happen because we're so close to fuck [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8512.640000000001s)]
*  It's like what we do with our our girls like, you know, we'll just be at a strip club and then [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8517.12s)]
*  Yeah [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8521.76s)]
*  What are you talking about and then someone's like no you were cheating with a brothel with 40 different people like I don't even [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8524.56s)]
*  know what the fuck [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8529.04s)]
*  Something crazy for them to fix it on and then you make there's no way I was in a brothel [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8533.2s)]
*  I don't even know any people what that when in reality you were just at a little korean strip club in hawaii [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8536.56s)]
*  So you need a lot of first-hand knowledge about this [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8546.64s)]
*  Okay [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8552.72s)]

*  Maybe outside of tokyo and you think that the better coffee is in some shit hole cafe [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8718.960000000001s)]
*  With the dopio espresso in milan or something. No, no, I didn't say I didn't say the coffee's better [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8724.72s)]

*  Built this country [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8766.640000000001s)]
*  I agree with you everything around that is better but an espresso at a beautiful cafe in europe is 10 times better [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8767.76s)]
*  It's not the same thing. No, okay [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8773.6s)]
*  And first of all again, we're in soho every five of the play literally is walking with what's the machine that they use to make [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8774.880000000001s)]

*  About the [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8804.32s)]
*  Europe-wise the food quality and I don't mean the cooking but the quality of the ingredients is undeniably so much better in europe [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8813.6s)]
*  Because in america, you're just allowed to do whatever this is actually morgan morgan is doing like a lawsuit against but like yeah [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8821.279999999999s)]
*  I would say the median food in europe is better but the high-end food in america [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8826.08s)]
*  If you want the non-gmo food our shit is better if you want the pasture-raised beef our stuff is better if you want [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8830.4s)]
*  Like the the really good stuff, but you're right the median food of ingredients in europe for the european is better [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8835.44s)]
*  I don't know if I trust american organic [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8841.52s)]

*  Rest Los angeles is not like a foodie destination. No, I don't think any restaurant that's popped up in los angeles started in new york [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8856.72s)]
*  I don't know unless it's a taco truck [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8863.12s)]
*  No, unless it's a taco. I think the asian food in los angeles might be better in san francisco [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8865.2s)]
*  And whose idea was it to bring them here? No, it's from from new york. Yeah [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8869.52s)]

*  It was on uh, seventh street between third avenue and second avenue and there's a beautiful burmese restaurant where you see it once a week [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8887.2s)]
*  I would I would have it we would order in from there. All right, you win and we walked in little neon mar [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8893.44s)]

*  They had the tree that you would attach the dollars to yeah [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8912.0s)]
*  And there was to raise money for whatever like war they had going on at the time [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8914.64s)]
*  And so you were actually funding like rohingya genocide [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8918.08s)]
*  I thought you could take the dollars [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8921.76s)]
*  Okay, um, okay. Okay. What else what else what else what else what else? [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8924.72s)]
*  Good food cities in america new york new orleans austin. I think philly's underrated austin. No, stop it with austin [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8928.960000000001s)]
*  I guys guys guys guys guys guys guys guys Mexican food bro. Yeah, we're fucking [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8935.039999999999s)]
*  Austin has great food your mexican food sucks here. I'm not debating that i'm not debating that i'm not debating and los angeles too [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8943.679999999998s)]
*  If we're being honest, I just want to let's just point this out with the food culture in austin. Yeah [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8950.64s)]
*  Austin has great food [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8954.88s)]
*  If you come from a place that doesn't have restaurants [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8957.359999999999s)]
*  Yes [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8960.0s)]
*  Have you come from middle of america? Yeah, it's most people that move there from middle america like holy shit [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8962.16s)]
*  What's a sushi roll like they have no that's not what we're talking about the sushi. That's the most amazing [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8966.96s)]
*  But the idea like I I don't like that. We're like we're putting austin as this like food destination. I understand [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8971.36s)]
*  It's not a food destination. I wouldn't say it's on the plane of new york. They're good. Yeah, but they didn't start in austin [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8977.36s)]
*  This is a perfect example of what we're saying. No, I would defend austin for the tax max alone [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8982.64s)]
*  Like just because you and I are from texas [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8986.16s)]
*  Tax max is a distinct thing. It's our thing. That's why I would recommend barbecue [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8989.44s)]
*  I'm not putting it on a new yorker la [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8994.08s)]
*  I understand. It's very exciting if you've never eaten in a restaurant and you go there and you're like wow [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=8997.039999999999s)]
*  This is really good food [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9001.68s)]
*  But nobody from new york or los angeles or paris or london or miami goes to austin [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9002.96s)]
*  They're like this is the greatest cuisine i've ever had in my life. I don't know. So like [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9008.88s)]

*  And this is one of those things too [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9384.72s)]
*  They have the greatest place it's the greatest place in the world to have children like they have daycare [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9385.68s)]
*  They have the incentives they have everything going for them. Nobody's having kids. Why do you think I have no idea? [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9389.6s)]
*  I think I think what it is is vitality [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9394.24s)]
*  And it's like the diet like in america and actually there's only one western no primal urges [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9398.0s)]
*  They remove every primal urge and the culture restricts it to back up your point [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9403.039999999999s)]
*  There's only one western country in the world with an above replacement birth rate israel among even among secular jews [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9407.039999999999s)]

*  All of this america. We're low korea japan sweden finland. They all have we all have [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9418.0s)]
*  Except america like pretty generous social welfare. We've got a year paternity leave doesn't make a fucking dent. When does the birth rate in america decline? [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9423.439999999999s)]
*  hungry, uh probably [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9430.08s)]
*  It's been a while probably 1960. I think it was the sexual revolution contraceptive [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9432.32s)]
*  But in terms of the current birth, what are we at right now? Like 1.7 or something like that [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9438.08s)]
*  Everyone game every time you finally get away these hoes [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9442.56s)]
*  My point is is that there's you can throw all of the money [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9446.16s)]
*  All of the social incentives that you want hungry. They literally pay your mortgage if you have four children people just don't do it [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9450.16s)]
*  Like it's like there's something about it. Oh, wow, that's actually lower than I thought. That's not good 1.6 [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9455.52s)]
*  Now we're coming back, but what's korea korea is like 0.9 or 0.8. It's so bad. It's south korea. Yeah, 0.78 disaster [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9460.88s)]
*  That's for people who don't know that's the total it's the tfr is the total fertility rate [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9468.72s)]
*  Which means the replacement needs to be about 2.2 to be to grow as a civilization [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9473.519999999999s)]
*  Japan loses 0.5 of his population every single year. So it's a disaster and no immigration [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9477.759999999998s)]
*  Well, yeah, and they have zero immigration, but that's the thing when you go there like makes sense [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9482.8s)]
*  They're all like they Japanese police each other. It's part of their culture. Yeah, that's what makes it great [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9486.96s)]
*  You you're as you describe it. You like that. I mean, I you want to be policed. There's something about it, which is so comforting [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9492.32s)]
*  Would you raise kids like that though? No, I probably would [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9499.039999999999s)]
*  I've got this frontier shit inside of me and as much as I love the rules and [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9504.88s)]
*  All of that when somebody tries to tell me what to do or I you know, I started my own business just like you [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9508.56s)]
*  You know, yeah, that's one of those where you hate not complete [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9512.8s)]

*  And they exist in the same way but even in the extreme sexual they're being [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9626.56s)]
*  Young cartoons with big tits. Yeah, it is weird [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9631.6s)]
*  It's it's this and then and then you see like the relationships you see people out eating together [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9634.48s)]
*  I'll see a couple out eating together and both of them are on their phones playing fruit ninja [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9639.279999999999s)]
*  Not even looking at each other [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9642.8s)]
*  It is i'm telling you it is one of the most tragically sad places you'll ever go to while at the same time [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9644.0s)]
*  One of the most unique and brilliant and incredible so there is a cost to that [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9649.439999999999s)]
*  Brilliant in in the absolutely and the cost to me is like the reason I like to travel [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9653.92s)]
*  I would never give any of it up would I ever want that culture here? [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9658.0s)]
*  But there's something I love about it for you. Yeah, go dip in [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9661.04s)]
*  Yeah, just to come in there and just be like man. I'm so safe dude [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9663.44s)]
*  When you watch little six-year-olds go to walk by themselves to school in tokyo with their backpacks on at night [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9666.32s)]
*  You're like, this is fucking insane. This would never happen. It's just seeing shit like they're like what you never feel a danger at all [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9672.88s)]
*  Zero nothing our boy benu yeti got blacked out drunk there [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9679.28s)]
*  Really tokyo fell asleep woke up his shoes and socks put next to him. Yeah socks folded [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9682.88s)]
*  Uh what his sweater put behind his head as a pillow and people just walking around him to go to work in the morning [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9688.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's beautiful the way that they care about each other there in terms of like [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9694.64s)]
*  Protection and respect. Yes, but everything is about respect. It's all about respecting [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9699.019999999999s)]
*  But no there's huge cost to it, but the cost to me the cost is high dude [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9703.039999999999s)]
*  You go to mexico and you feel the love in that culture, bro [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9706.08s)]
*  Like it's just it's like vibrating like that's true if you have a kid the way that they [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9708.88s)]
*  even when I was there with my wife was pregnant the excitement about her being pregnant they want to tell you about their kill and [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9714.72s)]
*  you're just like [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9719.84s)]
*  Uh, it's just it's magnificent. Yeah, it's amazing. But the emotional volatility is also bipolar. That is true [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9721.279999999999s)]
*  I mean like yeah, that's the cost bro. There's trade-offs for everything. That's that's it. That's all I I do think more americans should experience japan [[02:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9726.64s)]
*  Agreed because there's elements of it that we should yeah, we're like hey [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9734.96s)]
*  It's actually pretty nice to live in a city that's pretty fucking safe amazing things can happen commerce [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9738.0s)]
*  Like you can walk around you can send your kid there now a wife can work if she wants to take you know [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9742.24s)]
*  I have to worry about her kid not coming home at night or we don't deal with that [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9746.8s)]
*  Isn't that like the I don't want to get into like fucking evolutionary biology [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9750.48s)]
*  But like isn't that the isn't that what takes humans out of the chimpanzee realm is like safety? Oh civilization [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9753.8s)]
*  Like yeah, am I safe enough to develop ideas? Absolutely. Like if you watch that chimp show every second [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9761.16s)]
*  They're worried that the alpha is going to just start a fight. Yeah, it's either violence or eating [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9766.44s)]
*  Like that's all you worry about your base instinct. That's what all most the animal kingdom is once those are satisfied [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9769.96s)]
*  We started building skyscrapers. Yeah, absolutely [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9774.6s)]
*  Yeah, so okay. There is something. Okay. Okay. What's your take on the economy? [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9777.32s)]
*  Do you think trump has been good for the economy bad or it's too early to tell too soon to say obviously [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9780.92s)]
*  Uh, there is a problem. There's something called thermostatic public opinion where the idea is [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9785.8s)]
*  It's like a thermostat. You can push it up or push it down [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9790.76s)]
*  So the day for example that trump took office [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9793.0s)]
*  Democrats flipped from saying the economy was good to bad and republicans flicked from the economy is bad to go [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9795.48s)]
*  Because they're like biden's economy. Yeah, exactly [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9800.76s)]
*  So it's like is it really about the economy or was it about something else? [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9802.84s)]
*  Right. It's like this is why it's hard to say we have some data points [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9805.800000000001s)]
*  We're talking about the s&p or whatever [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9808.84s)]
*  Before the problem right now is consumer sentiment is going down people are a little worried about tariffs [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9810.68s)]
*  We have issues explain what consumer sentiment consumer sentiment is uh the confidence in the ability to purchase things either [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9815.72s)]
*  Consumer sentiment is like to purchase things either cheaply or the want to consume in the future [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9823.56s)]
*  It's actually an index that and that's based on my confidence at my [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9828.84s)]
*  That i'll have the money in the future to buy and if I don't feel like i'll have the future purchasing power [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9832.52s)]
*  That's another part. Yeah, so if we're at all restrictive in our spending, right? It's an indicator that we don't have confidence [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9837.0s)]
*  America is a consumer-based economy. We don't build anything 70% of gdp is literally just consumption. That's all we do here [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9843.48s)]
*  We're very good at it. So there's that home prices sky high in january [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9849.72s)]
*  That was a big reason we had a correction in the market [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9853.72s)]
*  There was a mortgage rates remain around like six seven percent disaster average home price is still like 400,000 in america [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9856.12s)]
*  Roughly a million in the metro area. That's really bad credit card. That is an all-time high [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9862.92s)]
*  The gambling thing doesn't fucking help like there's a lot of indicators there where [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9867.800000000001s)]
*  This is why I think trump won the election a big reason and if people here's the thing about the economy [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9871.96s)]
*  Americans can deal with the economy being bad. They understand that there's no magic fix [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9878.18s)]
*  But they need to feel as if you're doing everything to make it good about it [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9882.279999999999s)]
*  And this is a key point. One of my favorite books is called freedom from fear and it's a history of the roosevelt administration [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9886.68s)]
*  Here's what no the conservatives even said this at the time empirically the new deal didn't work [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9892.84s)]
*  Like it did not work in terms of its immediate goals of making the economy better, but you know what people felt [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9897.48s)]
*  Roosevelt is fighting for us and that was enough and that was it and he was a god for that [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9903.94s)]
*  He was a king the last king of america. So real quick the new deal just so you can explain it [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9908.84s)]
*  There was a lot of government work projects the wpa the ccc. These were all for the work projects administration [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9912.6s)]
*  And then other people filling them exactly is get people working [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9920.76s)]
*  Yeah, get people working at kane's unionism injecting money into the economy [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9923.16s)]
*  But the point was is they were like roosevelt is fighting for us [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9926.28s)]
*  He's doing everything when the supreme court tells him no, he does something else. He's an ideas man [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9929.48s)]
*  He's telling congress to do this the rural electrification [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9934.039999999999s)]
*  America did not [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9937.06s)]
*  Physically economically get all that much better, but it was about vigor [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9939.08s)]
*  That was another thing about jfk that used to say he had figure like he would [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9942.92s)]
*  Constantly be flying around the country and even though he wasn't particularly good president in terms of getting anything done or [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9946.58s)]
*  Passing any legislation they were like this breath of fresh confidence. That's what america needs [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9953.08s)]
*  That's where biden's ultimate failure was if you think about his slide it was about [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9957.8s)]
*  Nobody said you have a magic egg button or a gas button. Yeah, you're just like you're not doing we don't think you're doing anything [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9962.2s)]
*  Can I can i not doing okay? [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9968.12s)]
*  One thing to that that's the the danger that trump has is with this doge stuff is if we don't get to vigor [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9969.88s)]
*  Dealing with things on a daily basis then america gives you about a nine-month runway [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9976.2s)]
*  If we look at biden he sank in october with afghanistan. It was really about a lot of other stuff trump's got about [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9980.12s)]
*  Eight more months to go. You see that comment on on twitter all the time where it's like [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9985.960000000001s)]
*  gulf of america and then the first comment will just be like what our eggs cheaper now, right? [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9989.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah, right a thousand right? That's right. So to this uh when I was looking at the market and I know nothing about the fucking [[02:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9993.320000000002s)]
*  market, okay, but I have some money invested obviously and um [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=9998.52s)]
*  My first reaction to someone telling me hey this market looks a little suspect my first reaction was [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10004.12s)]
*  Man trump wouldn't let the market fail [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10011.0s)]
*  Now what is he can he do anything to keep it up? No, but a little bit [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10013.720000000001s)]
*  Of course, of course, but there's a part of me that goes he in my mind [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10017.960000000001s)]
*  He cares so much about how that would reflect on him [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10021.720000000001s)]
*  That he would do everything in his power to maintain it. Yeah, can he who knows but that little feeling like you were saying about uh, [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10025.960000000001s)]
*  Roosevelt oh roosevelt. Yeah, is this feeling is like he wouldn't let or he is trying to do it and that's really important to us [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10032.44s)]
*  Yes, the idea that that's everything. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's very key [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10038.52s)]
*  But that's my what i'm saying my worry about trump is this distraction and look america [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10041.800000000001s)]
*  Something's gonna happen like every presidency 9 11, right nine months into the bush administration 9 11 [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10047.800000000001s)]
*  All of a sudden the whole narrative is different under biden afghanistan. It didn't it wasn't planned [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10053.16s)]
*  It just fucking happened the ukraine trump won covid literally changed everything, you know, something will happen catrina or whatever [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10058.2s)]
*  And those are the clarifying moments when the magnifying glass comes on to you and went if the magnifying glass [[02:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10065.64s)]
*  If america doesn't like what it sees they will turn on your ass so quick [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10071.08s)]
*  George hw bush went 91 percent to losing the election in a span of 18 months [[02:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10074.36s)]
*  Like you can just get blown the fuck out. It's your reaction to that cataclysmic. It's usually [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10079.0s)]
*  Usually when you say george hw bush lost, you mean he won the down the republicans lost in 2008. No in 1992 george hw bush [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10083.96s)]
*  George hw bush had a 90 approval rating in 1991 blown the fuck out in the 92 election [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10090.039999999999s)]
*  Like again 04. What was it? Was that something happened or was it ross perot splitting dude? [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10095.32s)]
*  It was just like there was an economic modest depression at the time people felt 12 years of trickle-down economics [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10100.52s)]
*  Like I don't fucking trust you anymore. Boom. You're obsessed with safety was an issue too hw [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10106.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so hw remember clinton ran on that like hey, we're gonna that's right. Yeah the cold war whatever [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10111.08s)]
*  They thought it was too. Yeah, my point is just that america's very fickle. They will turn on your ass [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10115.8s)]
*  Very quickly almost every president the biggest danger [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10121.16s)]
*  Don't you don't uh you read too much into your mandate and you do something [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10124.36s)]
*  That didn't people quite voted for and then you also under deliver on what you did [[02:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10128.84s)]
*  And if you fall into that trap even at a feelings level you lose that's that's the great worry [[02:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10132.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's a huge Canada. I'm very supportive of tariffs because I believe in american manufacturing [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10138.84s)]
*  But the problem is is that it cannot be something that's ad hoc and haphazard. It has to have a plan [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10143.64s)]
*  We need to feel as if yes, the washing machine will cost more [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10150.039999999999s)]
*  It's because my cousin is going to get a job at this factory [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10152.519999999999s)]
*  That's going to be coming back to here [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10155.4s)]
*  And when we feel as if it's like it's coming in and it's off and it's all capricious as in like it's up to trump's [[02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10156.92s)]
*  Like however, he feels that day coming back and forth and the markets are swinging like this and i'm still don't have the plan yet [[02:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10162.6s)]
*  That's when people start to and again emotional a lot of runway. He's got runway, but you need to be careful [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10168.68s)]
*  Okay, i'm worried about doge. I'm worried about the tariff stuff, too. We need plans [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10175.0s)]
*  Um recently bezos. Yes. Oh the post. Yeah [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10178.28s)]
*  Yeah came out and said that his op-ed section of the post opinion. Yeah will now is that op-ed? [[02:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10182.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah his op-ed section or his opinion [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10188.76s)]
*  Uh section of the post so the newspaper operates in itself and there's also this section on the [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10191.0s)]
*  Newspaper called the op-ed and the the opinion part of a newspaper and you could probably speak more to this [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10195.08s)]
*  Maybe you describe it probably be better [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10199.480000000001s)]
*  Okay [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10201.0s)]
*  So the opinion part of a newspaper is old school tradition and it's when guys like william randolph [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10201.16s)]
*  Hurst and similar oligarchs owned these and they wanted to use their paper to express an opinion now [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10206.6s)]
*  When you use the word oligarch, it's like triggering. Oh, sorry, but they actually were oligarchs [[02:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10211.4s)]
*  When we think oligarch we think like russian bad guy villain just say he was a filthy rich politically connected person who had a [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10216.84s)]
*  He was a journalism magnet. Yeah, perfect. Okay. That's who william randolph. Hurst was uh people. Yeah, okay [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10223.56s)]
*  So bezos what he has done is he wants the washington post and it's also let me explain this about newspaper economics [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10228.2s)]
*  The op-ed section is always the most popular like the most read thing in the washington post is not the news the news [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10236.039999999999s)]
*  In and of itself has always been subsidized by reading means consumed. Yes, politically. Yeah, that's right. Exactly [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10242.199999999999s)]
*  So for example the news itself people don't want to pay for it [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10248.439999999999s)]
*  They want to pay for opinion they want to pay for classified ads [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10251.32s)]
*  The news has always been a secondary thing funded by something else [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10253.8s)]
*  The problem is here is that bezos is showing us he doesn't actually care about his business [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10257.32s)]
*  Because the washington post subscription base are people who what their democracy dies in the darkness [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10261.96s)]
*  That's why 200 000 of them cancelled their subscription whenever they didn't endorse kamala [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10267.08s)]
*  They just lost 75 000 more by saying we're only going to support free markets. So what did they say? [[02:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10271.88s)]
*  So usually the op-ed section. Yeah has uh differing opinions. Yeah, right [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10277.32s)]
*  The idea behind it. Let's just talk about the the fair idea behind it [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10283.4s)]
*  So it could be that your paper leans left [[02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10286.6s)]
*  But in the op-ed you would have right wing writers. You have left wing writers different opinions on these subjects [[02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10290.12s)]
*  So the newspaper is like here's what happens and then the op-ed is here are opinions about what happened [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10295.560000000001s)]
*  And these are potentially differing opinions. Yeah, that's right. And bezos just announces that the op-ed is now going to change from that [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10300.44s)]
*  to [[02:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10306.6s)]
*  espousing [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10307.7s)]
*  Free market ideas. So essentially like pro-capitalism and then what else? [[02:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10308.76s)]
*  Uh lip, uh, what is it personal liberty and then personal liberty? [[02:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10312.52s)]
*  So he's basically saying our newspaper is going to take a specific [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10315.720000000001s)]
*  Uh point of view and share opinions that reflect that specific point of view [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10320.84s)]
*  Now what you bring up is an interesting wrinkle. I didn't even pretty vague though. Say again personal liberty, isn't it? [[02:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10326.52s)]
*  Well, no, here's the thing what it really means calling it [[02:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10331.400000000001s)]
*  But he really means is let's fire all the woke people and let's get rid of the people who are rushing haters [[02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10334.28s)]
*  Which is what the washington post op-ed page has been for the last basically eight years and let's promote [[02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10339.64s)]
*  Bezos is a jet. Yeah, exactly, which is free free market free market, but not anti-trust, you know, it's like that [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10345.72s)]
*  That's a little not too free enough. So the worst interpretation of it is essentially [[02:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10352.92s)]
*  I'm going to use this as a propaganda tool to protect my business endeavors and the endeavors of my you know, uh, [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10357.4s)]
*  Colleagues if you will the other billionaire class now, that's the worst interpretation of it [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10364.6s)]
*  It might be the truest interpretation. Well, I think but let's take bezos out of it. Let's look at all of the biggest news companies [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10368.68s)]
*  That's what they are. For example, do you know like look at bloomberg news? [[02:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10374.04s)]
*  That's one of the most important things its job is to do what is to protect the bloomberg terminal and the integrity of the u.s [[02:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10378.04s)]
*  market like so so this is this is really interesting because [[02:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10383.800000000001s)]
*  What I believe most of us have come to learn and i've been incredibly naive about this is that the [[02:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10386.84s)]
*  billionaires so the people with immense power in america outside of [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10392.980000000001s)]
*  Controlling the narrative [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10398.04s)]
*  Can fluctuate in that power power based on the narrative so the intelligent ones like a bill gates msnbc is microsoft [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10400.36s)]
*  NBC what they do is they usually purchase or develop a media platform to protect their interests [[02:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10407.480000000001s)]
*  Bezos as he rides the superstardom [[02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10414.04s)]
*  Purchases the washington post with that in mind we would imagine I don't think he's going hey [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10416.76s)]
*  I just want the best ideas to be out there. No, you got to protect the fact that you're a billionaire buying a [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10421.640000000001s)]
*  10 million dollar yacht, which you have to take a bridge apart for exactly [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10427.4s)]
*  So it's like a bridge that was built in 1500 [[02:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10432.2s)]
*  You got to take it apart so it can go out now i'm some poor guy that can't afford eggs [[02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10434.52s)]
*  And I see you walking down the street exactly. I i'm not going to louisian manjoni, right? [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10437.800000000001s)]
*  But somebody else might want to do something like that. But what's interesting is before that happened? [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10441.4s)]
*  Nobody explicitly said that was the purpose [[02:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10446.76s)]
*  Everybody operated in this idea like hey we have integrity and this is the news and this is the information the american people can decide [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10450.36s)]
*  What is true or false? He's straight-up said [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10456.12s)]
*  I don't he's not straight up. Can I just say this? [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10459.400000000001s)]
*  This is actually a return to normal and I appreciate this. Can you explain how that back in the old days [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10461.480000000001s)]
*  Newspapers were partisan vehicles like alexander hamilton ran the post or whatever and it was like yeah the federalist papers [[02:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10467.140000000001s)]
*  But I actually it's a little bit more past that I thought it was that or the post no alexander hamilton [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10472.84s)]
*  Anyway [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10478.68s)]
*  All right [[02:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10481.880000000001s)]
*  Let me give you an example during the civil war you would have papers that are like the kansas city democrat and the kansas city [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10482.36s)]
*  Republican and it was in the name they were party paper [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10487.78s)]
*  And what they did is they ran news and op-eds that was like we're fucking democrats and fuck the other side [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10490.28s)]
*  That is the history of the american newspaper industry now what happened is basically you had founded in 1801 by alexander hamilton [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10495.720000000001s)]
*  The fuck else you think i'm talking about washington post. What do I care about? [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10504.2s)]
*  What do I care about? All right, there's one post and it's the new york [[02:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10508.28s)]
*  Okay [[02:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10512.76s)]
*  All right, he was an orphan [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10517.08s)]
*  Okay, so in the past [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10521.24s)]
*  We're explicitly partisan so I mentioned william randolph hearst william randolph hearst was like I want to go into the spanish-american war [[02:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10524.6s)]
*  That's something I want and so he used his op-ed and his newsmen to push that agenda [[02:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10530.52s)]
*  But he was very open about it. He was like this is my agenda. This is what I want [[02:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10535.0s)]
*  He later on he wanted to keep america out of world war two [[02:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10537.880000000001s)]
*  He would run a lot of linberg stuff like that's what his agenda was [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10540.2s)]
*  What happened is after world war two we had this very weird moment where you had non-partisan media [[02:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10544.36s)]
*  Which was still partisan where you had but the problem is the distribution [[02:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10550.04s)]
*  So you had the big papers and the big networks the big three channels, which all americans were watching [[02:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10553.560000000001s)]
*  They had to appear non-partisan and so corporations could sponsor them and reach as many people as possible [[02:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10557.720000000001s)]
*  And that's what created this idea of unbiased journalism [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10563.08s)]
*  No biased journalism is the most authentic journalism that has always existed [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10566.92s)]
*  It's called the yellow journalism industry and it was born on the streets of a great american city here in new york [[02:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10570.92s)]
*  You had the new york herald you had the new york coast you had the new york star and they were all different competing [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10576.52s)]
*  Both ideologies and it was one not only just for attention, but it was about pushing agendas [[02:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10582.76s)]
*  These people were open people would love for example the guy who worked who loved the herald and for planking on his name [[02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10587.960000000001s)]
*  They liked him. He was a he was not just an oligarch. He was a society figure a gilded age person people would support him [[02:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10593.96s)]
*  And it was all it was about picking teams and I think that's a good thing [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10600.279999999999s)]
*  I think it's healthy because it removes the veneer the news was just as fake and partisan in 1960 as it was today [[02:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10603.72s)]
*  It's actually worse in my opinion. And if you think about vietnam james corden benet, that's right an amazing figure [[02:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10610.519999999999s)]
*  But my point is like when walter cronkite was seen as non-partisan [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10615.96s)]
*  It was easier for us to push into war in vietnam [[02:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10620.06s)]
*  And it shouldn't take cronkite being like the trust has been broken america cannot lose here or win here in vietnam [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10623.82s)]
*  It's like no we needed the grand debate instead of the manufactured consent [[02:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10630.06s)]
*  Which is what pushed us into all of these bay of pigs [[02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10635.66s)]
*  I mean, this is what that they were very conscious about it [[02:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10639.26s)]
*  There was this controlled op-ed page in the in the washington post which was non-partisan even though yeah, okay the guy the guy [[02:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10642.06s)]
*  Who was running it? [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10648.939999999999s)]
*  Katherine graham's husband is best friends with john f kennedy and it just turns out that kennedy [[02:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10649.9s)]
*  One of the very first stops he makes on his inauguration night is to a bunch of washington post columnists who later become the [[02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10654.38s)]
*  Chief proponents and defenders of vietnam policy which was kennedy's policy to keep america in vietnam, but they were seen as non-partisan [[02:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10660.519999999999s)]
*  It's like no, we need to remove the non-partisanship partisanship is good actually [[02:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10668.619999999999s)]
*  You just need to trust what anyway what you're saying is it's good compared to the illusion of non-partisan [[02:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10674.3s)]
*  The illusion is is so dangerous and that's what we have the illusion dangerous because like I said [[02:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10681.02s)]
*  I mean when all of america's news was telling us that the war in vietnam was good and that we needed to go and find it [[02:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10686.14s)]
*  Americans believed that and they signed up to send their sons and daughters dude iraq is the perfect example in oh three [[02:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10692.06s)]
*  I mean we did not have if we had what we had today [[02:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10698.14s)]
*  Just based on the information somebody like me glenn greenwald who was actually fighting this fight at the time [[02:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10701.74s)]
*  I'd be like yo yellow cake uranium [[02:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10706.22s)]
*  Complete bullshit. This is wrong. The the outcome of this would be a disaster [[02:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10708.52s)]
*  America didn't even have an option on cable television [[02:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10714.7s)]
*  Of course, they support the head roger ailes saying this is the real the real news [[02:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10717.82s)]
*  Yeah, did you read that book? I recommend dude can't recommend enough the loudest voice in the room [[02:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10721.74s)]
*  Yeah, roger ailes on how he he understood he has a great quote, which is people don't want to be informed [[02:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10725.9s)]
*  They want to feel informed. Yeah, that's he understood america. He created fox news. He created fox news [[02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10731.02s)]
*  That's right. Hey, man rupert murdoch, but then don't you have way more echo chambers and yes [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10735.82s)]
*  I think you know what though at the end [[02:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10740.220000000001s)]
*  It's like the printing press the printing press led to 30 years of war on the european continent and mass death [[02:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10741.98s)]
*  It was still a good thing [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10746.78s)]
*  We have more information because yes, it led to the protestantism it led to uh, civil war [[02:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10747.9s)]
*  It led to all of these debates [[02:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10752.78s)]
*  But at the end of the day it was like the catholic church no longer controlling the minds of the serfdom [[02:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10754.140000000001s)]
*  It led to the renaissance it led to ideas. So look the internet is the printing press [[02:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10759.26s)]
*  We're returning to the mean like we have a new form of distribution [[02:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10763.98s)]
*  We can debate do we how long have we been going here like three hours? [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10767.42s)]
*  We're sitting here. We're fucking talking and all this would never air [[02:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10770.220000000001s)]
*  45 years ago this america was locked the fuck in to [[02:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10773.9s)]
*  Bullshit the echo chamber is already stonked [[02:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10778.04s)]
*  And the thing is that echo chamber is 10 times worse than any echo chamber today [[02:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10780.460000000001s)]
*  Even the most echo chambered republican is still has access to liberal media [[02:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10785.02s)]
*  Even the most echo chambered liberal still has access and can go at any time they want to ben shapiro or whatever [[02:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10790.460000000001s)]
*  Uh, somebody's out there 45 years ago. There was no option. So you got nothing. You gotta get a train soon [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10795.820000000002s)]
*  but I just to button this like [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10800.7s)]
*  Being bias [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10804.220000000001s)]
*  Is at least more honest so it's an improvement on honesty [[03:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10805.980000000001s)]
*  Whereas before the illusion of being unbiased takes a reader who thinks he's just getting the news [[03:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10809.74s)]
*  Now at least I get to look at the washington post and I go, okay [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10816.14s)]
*  This is going to be maybe a more right wing perspective. Yeah, I can look at uh, give me a good left wing [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10818.38s)]
*  outpost [[03:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10824.7s)]
*  Left like actual left wing jacobin sure the socialist newspaper. Yeah, it's called jacobin [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10826.22s)]
*  So jacobin like and if I want to get that take i'll read the same story at jacobin [[03:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10831.74s)]
*  If I want to get the right thing i'll read the washington post or you could just listen to breaking points [[03:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10836.619999999999s)]
*  But no, but my point actually [[03:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10841.179999999998s)]
*  Did you guys notice how when I was talking about ukraine? I I was like, hey [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10843.259999999998s)]
*  I have a real bias here because I cannot tell you i'm honestly ukraine is probably one of my top issues like foreign policy [[03:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10847.259999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I cannot give you the real pro ukraine side with the same enthusiasm that I do. I tried [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10853.339999999998s)]
*  I tried to do the old steel man thing. Yeah, but I have a i'm just not gonna do it [[03:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10857.98s)]
*  Like if you want to hear that go to david ignatius go to uh max boot [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10861.419999999998s)]
*  Go to uh, ann marie slaughter any of these people these real neocons number one. They believe in this shit [[03:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10866.14s)]
*  Please go read them. Don't just listen to me because you need all your information. This is how you get I agree with you [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10871.74s)]
*  That's what i'm saying institutions is understand what you're digesting if you tell me that food is healthy [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10876.22s)]
*  Yeah, and then I eat it right and I get some sort of disease [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10881.02s)]
*  I stop trusting the people who are telling me it's healthy if you tell me something is not healthy every cookie spot [[03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10884.06s)]
*  We go to they go. Yo, this is a thousand calories when I feel like shit afterwards [[03:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10889.18s)]
*  I'm like you better give me that thousand. Yes, you know if I feel healthy after that cookie, then you're lying to me [[03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10892.38s)]
*  Yeah, so so okay at first I was like I was concerned about the bias and information [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10897.259999999998s)]
*  as long as there are [[03:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10902.3s)]
*  Equal I don't want to say equal but as long as there is information that's accessible out there that shows the opposition and both are being [[03:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10904.699999999999s)]
*  Honest about it. Yeah, maybe this is a good thing [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10911.259999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I agree [[03:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10913.82s)]
*  This is great and I like the fact that you said that the the original idea of this is the information [[03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10914.46s)]
*  Comes from wanting to sell more ads dude. It's only a 50 year old idea. It's an aberration in america [[03:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10920.14s)]
*  America has always been dude. We had the california democrat the california republican. They're at war with their own state [[03:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10925.34s)]
*  How should we govern gold policy? Should we be in the civil war even in the confederacy? [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10931.26s)]
*  They had different papers being like we need to do this [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10935.74s)]
*  No, we don't need to do that like it's the bias and the the dueling perspective. That's how it's always been [[03:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10938.14s)]
*  The 1950s was an asterisk in an otherwise like a country that has always been [[03:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10945.26s)]
*  We've always recognized that news and information in and of itself is not actually all that valuable as in [[03:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10951.5s)]
*  X y and z happened people don't want to know that they want to go x y and z happened and what did it mean? [[03:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10958.220000000001s)]
*  And that is what the newspaper and the information industry is all about [[03:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10963.82s)]
*  So i'm still very optimistic because in the internet age, it's not just about declining trust in mainstream media [[03:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10968.54s)]
*  It's about an explosion of a new possibility and there'll be a lot of bullshit out there [[03:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10973.34s)]
*  Just like the invention of the printing press was mostly what pornography conspiracy theory, whatever it was [[03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10977.18s)]
*  Starting wars it was chaotic [[03:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10982.86s)]
*  But the net benefit was lack of control by singular institutions with their own agendas [[03:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10984.78s)]
*  And I think the decentralization of this will be very chaotic and it will not necessarily be comfortable [[03:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10990.460000000001s)]
*  But I think we'll end up in a better place. Sagar is eddie breaking points. Go check it out. Thank you so much [[03:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=10995.58s)]
*  We love you brother. We appreciate you [[03:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyIcEHcCejs&t=11000.3s)]
