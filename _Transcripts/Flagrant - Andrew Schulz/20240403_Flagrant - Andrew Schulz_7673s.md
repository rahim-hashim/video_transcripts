# Real Reason Candace Owens Left Shapiro, Drake Vs Kendrick Diss, & Trans Visibility Day Explained
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [April 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ)
*  What's up everybody welcome to flagrant happy trans visibility day yes [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Akash didn't know what trans visibility day. I did not so basically what happened was the world and by the world [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=6.32s)]
*  I mean right wing twitter and instagram was absolutely furious that [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=12.72s)]
*  Transvisibility day was made the same day as easter. You did see this a little no, I just put it together [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=17.66s)]
*  So easter and trans visibility day was made the same day and you know who made it the same day according to right wing twitter [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=22.8s)]
*  Instagram who well Joe Biden made it he probably forgot he declared it [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=29.76s)]
*  He might have forgotten or mark what what might else be true? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=34.4s)]
*  I saw this and I was like this is crazy [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=37.52s)]
*  Why is Biden trying to piss off everybody because when you see it on the surface? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=39.44s)]
*  There's like there's no way that this is actually possible because there are a team of people that are there to make sure things [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=42.96s)]
*  Like this do not happen. It just seems unrealistic because this is an election cycle [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, you'd be I'm not saying that Biden is gonna win [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=53.94s)]
*  The religious rights [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=57.76s)]
*  But you don't want to irritate you don't want to lose them exactly [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=59.84s)]
*  What's them in down some direction right so we're like there's no way that this is true [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=63.68s)]
*  But everybody is posting and every headline is Joe [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=69.0s)]
*  Biden declares [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=73.12s)]
*  Easter Sunday trans visibility day, which isn't technically wrong, but but it seems like a little misleading because now the first trans visibility day was [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=75.6s)]
*  Founded 2009. How many years ago is that this was? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=83.08s)]
*  15 that's 15 years. So the first trans visibility days founded 15 years ago, right? Okay. Now what is something very unique about Easter? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=86.84s)]
*  Today Jesus is risen right that is actually yo [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=96.36s)]
*  Well, that is fire that you know, I fuck with you for that right? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's actually Christ is king. Don't let nobody tell you different crisis [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=101.52s)]
*  Get the camera [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=109.16s)]
*  Happy trans visibility day [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=117.32s)]
*  Okay, listen, okay [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=126.2s)]
*  now Easter [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=128.52s)]
*  Because it's on a Sunday, correct the date [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=130.2s)]
*  Changes every single year. Do you think it's possible when they I mean, this is how brilliant and shrewd the left is [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=133.68s)]
*  This is how genius they are at tearing apart the nuclear family and destroying the great Christian traditions of this country [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=141.96s)]
*  15 years ago, they plotted the course [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=149.16s)]
*  Of Easter's and they're like one Easter when a Democrat is in office [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=152.68s)]
*  There's going to be a trans visibility day and an Easter Sunday [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=159.04s)]
*  They lie in the same day and Joseph Biden is going to be forced to declare a trans visibility day over Easter [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=163.0s)]
*  That's definitely what it was right well they also doesn't the calendar repeat every seven years [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=169.6s)]
*  Yeah, that's our six. I guess because a leap year. Oh, wait, is that true? I would assume six [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=174.92s)]
*  I would this guy's fucking good whether seven days in a week, but you skip one day cuz of you leap years [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=180.72s)]
*  I would assume it's six. So then maybe it's seven [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=185.92s)]
*  They did it 2015 and this year also and nobody said shit back then did that then you then you can you who was coming? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=187.88s)]
*  Well, we're the hero was coming to save the day in a year. Well, who was president at the time? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=193.79999999999998s)]
*  That's what maybe we should look it was Barack's but 2016 Trump. So 2015 you said 2015 [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=197.74s)]
*  We gotta see when the calendar repeated [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=203.58s)]
*  Guys isn't trans visibility day every day for Barack [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=206.82000000000002s)]
*  Can I get a mic check hold on [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=213.3s)]
*  Whenever I say crisis King I need a close-up on Jeff. Yeah crisis King crisis King Michelle Obama's king [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=227.74s)]
*  Stop we're doing that thing where we become to right wing on the pot [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=236.9s)]
*  Okay, so 20 21 21 of both of them 20 21 by proclaimed the 31st transgender [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=245.58s)]

*  We gotta get our guys baptized you ain't been trying to tell you say what stop trying to bathe them [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=265.5s)]
*  That is true, why don't you baptize your damn armpits himself baby that's the last that's the last time, huh? Yeah [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=275.42s)]
*  Okay, listen, so all right say your numbers [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=282.02s)]
*  His favorite part [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=287.74s)]
*  2021 Biden said that this was the first national trans visibility day [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=299.66s)]
*  So basically it was like an organization that did then he picked it up in 2021 was like, all right now [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=302.98s)]
*  We're doing declared in 2021. Yep [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=306.74s)]
*  No, the team this year was too fucking stonad to look into if there was gonna be Easter on a trans visibility day [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=309.22s)]
*  So then they're in a pickle where they're like, okay [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=316.82s)]
*  We see it's lining up on Easter do we double down and like make the proclamation or do we kind of forget that we did? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=318.62s)]
*  That just can't you just change the date like change the month. I mean, there's one thing trans people would understand [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=323.76s)]
*  I mean, it's April 1st now [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=329.5s)]
*  Or June isn't June also, why do the trans people want to share with [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=335.7s)]
*  Because you're gay in June February we got Juneteenth [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=341.22s)]
*  Nothing close around that so imagine trans visibility day was Juneteenth. What would you do? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=345.38s)]
*  All the people are saying bad things about trans visibility day [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=359.1s)]
*  Nanofiber [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=374.38s)]
*  Like it we're sorry about that. Okay. Listen, so this is all we all we want to ask right now is [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=395.62s)]
*  If it was that easy for us to look this up, mm-hmm. Why do you think? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=401.98s)]
*  There are so many people that are posting about it [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=408.94s)]
*  What is the reason because they could also look it up. These are not dumb people. It's not like just some random Twitter account [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=413.14000000000004s)]

*  Money wait, what do you mean? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=425.34000000000003s)]
*  Do you think you think that there is money to be made all the outrage [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=428.09999999999997s)]
*  Do you think if you outrage a certain community they will consume your content way more? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=432.7s)]
*  Yeah, wait, is that what these people are seems to be how it goes. Get the fuck out of here seems to be yeah [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=436.41999999999996s)]

*  Without the laugh it really just sounded like hate [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=462.73999999999995s)]
*  Just dying. No, no, but you're right. They broke so we gotta find out [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=465.61999999999995s)]
*  No, no, because what was that little blonde chick that did it? She pissed off black people. She's Tommy Lerner and Tommy Larry [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=470.46s)]
*  Say good. What happened her where's yeah, I mean, that's what Ben Shapiro used to do at the beginning of his career [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=477.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, where's Tommy? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=481.58s)]
*  It's an interesting yeah, it's an interesting pivot to watch Ben Shapiro and Candace [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=484.26s)]
*  It's funny cuz they're feuding but it seems like the same thing [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=487.97999999999996s)]
*  You start really kind of right-leaning girl and you get a little bit more toward the center go mainstream all of a sudden [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=489.97999999999996s)]
*  Well, let's just forget all the other stuff [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=495.21999999999997s)]
*  Misunderstood what I said, I wasn't just feeding an agenda to make money off of dumb people. No, no, no, there's you guys misunderstood [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=497.58s)]
*  There's a great interview where where Ben is [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=503.5s)]
*  Justifying why he fired Candace. Yeah, and the one with the room. Yes [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=507.38s)]
*  That's great. We should even pick it up and watch it [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=513.5799999999999s)]
*  But what's funny is is it and I don't know the extent into which Ben is criticized [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=515.42s)]
*  I know he's very critical of media and media being biased. Yeah, but before you have a media platform [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=519.8199999999999s)]
*  It's very easy to critique media. It's very easy to go look at New York Times [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=525.26s)]
*  Look what you do and look at Washington Post. Look what you do and you're censoring free speech. You're for censorship [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=529.26s)]
*  In this conversation, he makes the argument for censorship. He calls it something else. Yeah, I forgot the term [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=535.3s)]
*  I have in my phone, but he only even think he's using the term right but he's basically like there's a window of [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=541.38s)]
*  Ideas we accept. Yes, and we accept ideas between this this I guess this is if I get window [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=546.46s)]
*  You're looking like this. So we accept ideas between here and here and anything outside of that window. Well, you're fireball that's censorship [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=552.98s)]
*  but he's acting as if this is like a [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=559.7800000000001s)]
*  Justified reason for firing people when you built your identity and platform off of no censorship and freedom of speech [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=563.1s)]
*  Facts don't care about your feelings and all this shit. It's also funny that that window happens to end where his beliefs end [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=569.4599999999999s)]
*  That's where the window ends that's also your specific personal belief [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=577.66s)]
*  I just don't see can't have an opinion on your platform that is not pro a [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=582.14s)]
*  Country that is not ours. Yeah, wait a minute crazy [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=588.38s)]
*  I wish so is the daily wire an American media platform or is it an Israeli media platform? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=592.4799999999999s)]
*  I'm just asking this guy's cooking [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=597.88s)]
*  I'm just know if if the rule is I'm just saying if the rule is you cannot be critical because he has no problem [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=602.36s)]
*  Being very critical of America. Yep critical of the left in America left is half the country [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=609.68s)]
*  There's no problem eviscerating half the current power in party in power, but you can't criticize [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=613.74s)]
*  Israel as a country. It's just another country unless [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=620.1999999999999s)]
*  You're saying and you're clearly admitting that the daily wire is an arm of the Israeli I guess media or [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=623.24s)]
*  Propaganda machine for what is that? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=631.5600000000001s)]
*  Are you manipulating the the religious right in America? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=633.9200000000001s)]
*  Are you manipulating the right-wing conservatives in America and selling them? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=638.28s)]
*  country Western movies and putting on your little cowboy hat and fake moving in Nashville so that you two could take all their money and [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=643.12s)]
*  Then in the process restricting free speech one of the core tenants of the American identity bed Ben Ben [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=650.12s)]
*  Benjamin Ben what is happening? There's trouble in paradise [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=657.4s)]
*  What shall we do? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=662.24s)]
*  I don't want this to be true. I want to believe that the the the daily wire is the last bastion of free speech [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=667.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I want. I thought he was absolutely like a free speech. That's that's what I considered it wasn't it? No, so [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=672.96s)]
*  I [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=681.12s)]
*  Overton when are you saying that he's free his speech? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=682.12s)]
*  Yeah, the exact thing he's been critical of the left throughout his entire career his position. Sorry term he use overton window [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=684.84s)]
*  Yeah, overton window. Yes. Yeah, I thought the position he took between like platform and publisher [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=691.12s)]
*  I thought was interesting. Mm-hmm [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=696.68s)]
*  Cuz he's basically saying like he believes that platform should have free speech because those are town squares [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=697.92s)]
*  And so like corporate censorship from like Twitter at X or like Instagram and shit like that [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=702.64s)]
*  He's claiming that that would be a violation of free speech, but he thinks as a publisher you don't necessarily need to [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=707.72s)]
*  Uphold things outside of your editorial view yet [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=713.88s)]
*  He was quite critical when the New York Times fired journalists for publishing Tom Cotton's article, right? See he was ready [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=716.28s)]
*  I didn't know this this motherfucker was ready. I know I was out [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=722.96s)]
*  Now that is kind of that kind of hypocritical no seems a bit is to is to be critical of another [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=728.48s)]
*  Platform mm-hmm, right? No, sorry of another publisher [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=735.84s)]
*  Yeah for firing someone on the basis of their opinion for an op-ed piece [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=738.88s)]
*  Because that opinion did not fit in the overton window [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=744.9200000000001s)]
*  Yet he is firing people because their opinions do not fit in the overton window now [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=748.12s)]
*  We could vehemently disagree with the people's opinions that he has fired [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=752.6400000000001s)]
*  I'm sure there are plenty of things that Kansas said that we think are horrible. Yeah [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=757.9200000000001s)]
*  Oh [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=762.42s)]
*  Yeah, that is not the brand you built my friend correct. He also claims that it wasn't Israel though. Yeah, that's the thing [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=763.62s)]
*  We can disagree on that like I'm sure you could go at it with him on this [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=771.46s)]
*  But he claims at the end that it has nothing to do with his position on Israel [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=775.9399999999999s)]
*  I bring up Israel. The reason I bring up Israel is because he himself has tweeted that [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=778.9s)]
*  What is that fucking skeleton looking bitch that's in media? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=784.8199999999999s)]
*  The fuck is her name and culture and culture and culture was doing this [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=788.8199999999999s)]
*  Where instead of calling Jews Jews, she calls them globalists, but then she was like, I think Matthew Tucker's half globalist [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=796.26s)]
*  Inflammatory as hell, but she's funny. So you know during the debates when Vivek and Nikki Haley were going at it [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=810.34s)]
*  She tweeted to her followers guys don't get involved. This is Hindu business. Not our fight [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=816.06s)]
*  Sick Christian, it's funny though. Anyway, so it's so funny. But uh, but what the fuck was I just saying? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=822.8199999999999s)]
*  The skeleton, oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So he was like she says [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=829.66s)]
*  Incredibly anti-semitic things but she's pro-israel so I can look past it all now [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=834.8199999999999s)]
*  I don't think she's working for the daily wire at that moment, but that's his basically basic position [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=840.8399999999999s)]
*  Hey freedom speech is totally down as long as you're pro-israel. Mm-hmm, and I guess hand is mm-hmm [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=845.28s)]
*  Seems so dove. I'm just saying you should be able to [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=851.8399999999999s)]
*  What what what do you think? I'll lean to the point of we're very fortunate to have a globalist on this pocket [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=855.4399999999999s)]
*  Say I think the whole can is saying is closer to a little anti-semitism [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=862.0799999999999s)]
*  Play over the Israel thing. He hasn't historically been that guy like the spearhead of like pro-israel [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=867.76s)]
*  I think it's been more of it's your point. It's yeah the platform protecting that. Thank you, Mark. Thank you [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=875.28s)]
*  Cuz I've looked into and I haven't found anything outright anti-semitic that Candice said can you tell me something cuz the article I saw [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=882.16s)]
*  Very anti-semitic trope [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=890.0s)]
*  Which was I think it was she liked it. She liked a comment [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=892.9599999999999s)]
*  Someone said that Rabbi Schmooley was drunk off Christian blood or something to that effect. Yeah, she liked it and then [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=896.4399999999999s)]
*  Apparently she had like defensive of Kanye. I think she's also been like defensive of Hitler [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=902.88s)]
*  Well, I she had like had admired like it's all like nuance. I haven't listened to every single little thing [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=908.76s)]
*  Yeah, like the general feeling is like she was not [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=913.54s)]
*  Outraged by what Kanye had said and was kind of like trying to defend him from the media and had said like there's like rings [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=916.84s)]
*  Of people in Hollywood that are you know committing, you know violence against people that are acting like gangs [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=922.34s)]
*  It is interesting timing to suddenly get offended by Kanye. Yeah [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=927.76s)]
*  Cuz that was slavery was a choice [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=931.1999999999999s)]
*  She probably didn't have a problem with that. I'm assuming and you wouldn't venture fear [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=933.64s)]
*  I don't think would have been like whoa. Whoa slavery is reprehensible as was the Holocaust. The slavery is reprehensible [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=936.9399999999999s)]
*  How can you say it was a choice these people weren't? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=942.16s)]
*  They didn't choose to come on these ships and do this and why would she be getting fired now for the things Kanye said? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=944.16s)]
*  Like I think it was a year and a half. Yeah, it's also very well [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=949.76s)]
*  it was like through November that she was like defending him and and [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=952.04s)]
*  Obviously, I think the Israel stuff like lit up [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=956.0s)]
*  And then she was going back and forth with other co-hosts I think it was like [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=958.88s)]
*  Decorum also she was like calling out Shapiro being like he's annoying. She's also their biggest show that's not been Shapiro [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=963.0400000000001s)]
*  She's massive. She's the biggest star on the platform that is not a owner of the platform [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=969.6800000000001s)]
*  I think Ben is one of the owners. So you have a very tricky thing where your base the people consuming your content are [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=974.82s)]
*  Equally drawn to her than they are to Ben [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=982.96s)]
*  Potentially could go even more [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=986.8s)]
*  You might have to nip that before she can take a stranglehold of the identity of your platform [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=988.8s)]
*  Mm-hmm. So I think that this is it's not just oh you said something bad [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=994.8s)]
*  I think it's a trend and seeing this unstoppable force because Candice is unstoppable life tour announcement a few things Las Vegas [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=998.52s)]

*  She will say whatever she wants to say she will debate any single person [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1082.44s)]
*  She'll go out there and do it right Ben Shapiro is dating call debating college kids. Yeah, let's just be right [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1085.8400000000001s)]
*  Anytime he debates somebody who's like worthy he either gets washed or bare minimum stalemate [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1092.0s)]
*  I've never seen him actually win a debate against somebody who's like educated in the matter, right? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1096.68s)]
*  So I think he can body guys like Finkelstein. I'm sorry. He won't do it. Finkelstein has been asking him non-stop [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1101.24s)]
*  He refused to do it. Mm-hmm scared. He's scared. Of course. He's scared, but now you want to see who's dedicated his life to this [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1106.64s)]
*  I don't think Ben has dedicated his life to this [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1112.5600000000002s)]
*  But think we'll see has been calling him out again with with destiny. I mean they were kind of on the destiny [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1114.88s)]
*  Come on guitar on the internet [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1120.72s)]
*  The fact that no, I'm not saying he's not smart [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1124.5600000000002s)]
*  But I'm saying he has not dedicated his life to this the fact that he's just picking up this hobby and he's out there [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1126.5600000000002s)]
*  Debating the top dudes in this right? Yeah, I don't know his content [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1133.6000000000001s)]
*  But I would assume destiny's life is not dedicated to this [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1138.4s)]
*  His name is destiny at the YouTube handle that I assume he uses for other things beyond this [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1140.96s)]
*  So if Ben Shapiro was stalemating a guy who doesn't dedicate himself to this that's not great for Ben Shapiro [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1144.48s)]
*  I think they were on the same side. Oh [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1149.52s)]
*  Was debating Finkelstein and everything else. I mean destiny knows how to debate [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1152.16s)]
*  Yeah, no, he's and he will read the stuff and he is is amazing retention every time I see him [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1155.84s)]
*  He is like this crate recall. So it seems like if he reads something it's locked in forever [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1161.12s)]
*  Doesn't matter that being said. What was the argument? What were we just talking about? [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1166.68s)]
*  Ben Shapiro getting Washington Candice Owens is getting yeah, it's an unstoppable force [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1171.44s)]
*  so I think what they're doing is they were worried that she was a runaway train with the [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1175.32s)]
*  with the brand [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1180.0s)]
*  That she was also souring his reputation within the brand within the brand [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1181.28s)]
*  So you have the person who owns it who should be the leader of it who is going to lead the identity of the brand? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1185.44s)]
*  Right is now wavering in their opinions on the well [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1191.6s)]
*  No in their influence within the brand and there's this new source that is changing the course of the brand [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1196.44s)]
*  The reason you start a media platform is you want to have some control and power [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1200.92s)]
*  Nobody starts a media platform. He's like I love the news [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1204.6399999999999s)]
*  You want to in the most altruistic sense you want to [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1207.72s)]
*  Influence the course of the country that you are in right? Yeah, you want the good ideas to win? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1212.92s)]
*  That's the best case scenario. What it most likely is is hey [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1218.8799999999999s)]
*  We got to manipulate these people into thinking what we want so that you know [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1223.3799999999999s)]
*  We can live in a place that is beneficial for us [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1226.68s)]
*  And I think that's what the Koch brothers do and that's what I'm sure Peter Thiel does and that's what I'm sure [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1228.84s)]
*  The fucking MSM was it Bill Gates does and that's what I'm sure the Washington Post is for Jeff Bezos [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1233.8400000000001s)]
*  Like that's the point of media is control and they were losing control of their platform [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1239.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, so consumers of daily wire are they? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1244.04s)]
*  Like looking at them like they're funny in the light now like yo you guys fire [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1247.64s)]
*  That's our thing seems like it's split my my concern about I think the biggest concern about the daily wire is that their consumers? [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1251.54s)]
*  Ben doesn't represent their consumers back when it was just liberal versus conservative. He was this incredible [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1258.9199999999998s)]
*  Soundbite machine for conservative talking points and he had and he was brave and [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1267.3999999999999s)]
*  He would say anything and he would go out there and he'd [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1273.36s)]
*  Interview a trans person and fucking rip him apart like he would he basically had every single nugget [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1276.52s)]
*  Ready locked and loaded so that all these people who are conservative were now like oh you've done the intellectual heavy lifting for me [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1282.32s)]
*  Great. Give me all those talking points. I can use them [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1290.2s)]
*  Now there seems to be a little bit of especially after October 7th a little bit of division [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1293.64s)]
*  Yeah in the conservative party and the Democrat and the Democrat for sure [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1298.6s)]
*  Yeah, so there's a little bit of division right and now you're seeing this culture war that's happening within [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1303.1s)]
*  Politics because the reality is that the right-wing conservative Christians that were following Ben were following because he was giving them the artillery [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1308.44s)]
*  To be the most eloquent articulate conservative that they could be [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1315.92s)]
*  Well, he's not giving them the arguments for what they feel now [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1320.48s)]
*  Yeah, and for what some of them feel now and Candice might be giving them the arguments for what some of them feel now [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1323.3000000000002s)]
*  So you got to nip that in the bud, but he's not representative of this middle America salt of the earth [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1330.0800000000002s)]
*  Guy [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1336.08s)]
*  Mm-hmm the guy I think he grew up in LA. Mm-hmm went to Harvard [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1338.08s)]
*  Like he never lived a life that is representative of them at all [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1341.96s)]
*  He has no clue who they are what they are. Does Candice represent them though? I'm not saying Candice does [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1345.62s)]
*  I don't know her background. What I'm saying is she is he was representing what they needed when they needed arguments [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1350.26s)]
*  Yeah, now the culture were shifted now. They might need justification for Christianity [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1356.52s)]
*  There's an attack on Christianity Trans Day is on the same day as Easter [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1361.56s)]
*  Christians might feel a little bit like they need more representation. They're not gonna get that from the Jewish guy. Yeah [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1366.3s)]
*  Mm-hmm. It's a good point. This is kind of how I'm seeing this map out [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1373.74s)]
*  So I don't think it's that she said something wrong [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1377.3s)]
*  I think that she was running away with that platform and it was a matter of fucking time and there's nothing that he could do [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1379.26s)]
*  About it. He can't beat her on ideas. He can't beat her on being thought-provoking [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1384.26s)]
*  He's way less brave now that he has a media conglomerate. She doesn't have a meeting and he's tied to a belief [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1389.02s)]
*  He is pro-israel [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1394.74s)]
*  Candice doesn't seem to be she doesn't have a core belief that she will not waver on whether right or wrong or whatever [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1396.18s)]
*  She'll go with the wind. She will she's the president of France's wife is a man [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1401.78s)]
*  But we're a comedy platform that's saying shit to be funny she is a news platform that's like I think it's a guy and there's [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1412.6200000000001s)]
*  She's hilarious. She goes I'll stake my whole career on this one [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1419.52s)]
*  I've never had anything [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1425.58s)]
*  I think that's my thing. I think daily wire was terrified that she was running away with the platform [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1428.94s)]
*  Yeah, but again, he you can't use he can't say anything anti-israel. He's got to be very she gonna have that those guardrails [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1433.1s)]
*  Yeah, sure. So fuck you wants at all times anti-israel is is is maybe even a [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1439.06s)]
*  Word we could change like critical of the the country Israel [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1443.7s)]
*  Okay, and it is just cuz I don't want I don't want to put any stigma anything like every country America should be criticized [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1447.82s)]
*  Yeah, Israel should be criticized [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1453.82s)]
*  Saudi Arabia should be criticized England should be criticized Sri Lanka should be fine [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1455.8999999999999s)]
*  And if you a lot of people probably even listening don't even have Jewish friends [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1459.3s)]
*  If you had Jewish friends, you would know they are more critical of Israel than any of you guys are [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1462.8999999999999s)]
*  Because you don't even know much about fucking Israel [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1467.86s)]
*  Yeah [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1469.94s)]
*  So the idea that there's this like a unanimous support and every single Jewish person feels the exact same way about it [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1470.24s)]
*  It's not the case at all. Yeah [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1475.74s)]
*  But there is there does seem to be that hypersensitivity when there is critique of Israel [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1477.46s)]
*  That it is turned into anti-semitism [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1482.54s)]
*  Now some people are critical of Israel because they are anti-semitic absolutely and some people are critical of Israel because they're just there's things to criticize [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1484.8200000000002s)]
*  Things are good frankly, so that's the article I read and I could also say yes [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1491.74s)]
*  We know that bench girl probably has a bias towards support. There must be something there [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1495.94s)]
*  But do you think then that it still means everything that he's built and supported for the conservative American community [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1500.24s)]
*  It's just thrown out because he still has this little bias like no [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1506.26s)]
*  I think he could still be a you know a great representative for everything [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1509.74s)]
*  I really believe that he sticks to American values believes in in all things [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1514.14s)]
*  Conservatism and yeah, he has a little bias but he's done a pretty good job to take [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1519.14s)]
*  Here's what I think he's learning the limitations of his conservativism and it undermines the thing that was built on which was seemingly [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1525.38s)]
*  Presented front-facing free speech. We're not squashing ideas here just because we don't agree with them, etc [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1532.98s)]
*  Now you seem to be doing that so that does tear away at that entire foundation [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1538.54s)]
*  So the idea is now what else are you kind of? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1542.52s)]
*  Compromised or wavering now. I look at you as the pro-israel a new source and that's your design [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1544.98s)]
*  You didn't have you didn't have an audience in the American system and the fundamental core tenant of free speech [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1550.94s)]
*  You didn't have the confidence in it to just let it happen [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1558.24s)]
*  You pretended you did when it was beneficial to you [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1560.8200000000002s)]
*  But once there was a moment where having that true free speech [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1563.82s)]
*  Could take your platform and lead it in a different direction [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1569.26s)]
*  You immediately did what every platform does which is control the speech and now you're just learning what it is to own a media [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1572.62s)]
*  Company and ODM media company is not free speech low-key. That's why Elon might be the goat now granted [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1579.78s)]
*  it's different when you have a [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1585.86s)]
*  What is it called a publisher? [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1587.54s)]
*  sorry, so I might have messed up those words, but like [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1589.62s)]
*  Elon is literally allowing free speech and it's fucking chaos on Twitter. It's fire [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1592.3s)]
*  It's fire, but it's chaos, but that's what free speech is. It's fucking chaos [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1597.78s)]
*  No [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1602.8999999999999s)]
*  he's saying that he has some people on the platform or on the that he publishes that have anti-israel ideas or [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1603.3799999999999s)]
*  Ideas that are critical of Israel that he disagrees within the window exactly. Yeah, which is censorship. It's censorship [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1609.54s)]
*  Censorship censorship so you cannot act like you are [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1616.06s)]
*  Pro [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1620.06s)]
*  Free speech completely like you're an absolutist. You're no longer an absolutist. You are a person that owns a business and [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1621.7s)]
*  You are willing to have censorship in order to make money [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1627.86s)]
*  So close that but he said he was like we wouldn't have someone on the on that [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1632.22s)]
*  We published that has like staunchly pro-abortion ideals like we wouldn't contract that person. We wouldn't pay them. So yes, so you're a phony [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1636.06s)]
*  mmm [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1642.6599999999999s)]
*  Mm-hmm. I had the thing I couldn't figure out is whether or not he was a [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1643.78s)]
*  That's a great response [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1647.42s)]
*  Absolutist I couldn't figure out like his position maybe maybe he is a free speech absolutist [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1649.54s)]
*  Maybe he's not I don't know but his platform is a propaganda machine for his beliefs [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1655.14s)]
*  Goddamn, which is what media platforms are but now don't be critical for the New York Times leaning left or Washington Post [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1661.4s)]
*  Protecting Amazon you can no longer do that and you have done that in your career [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1669.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, cuz I I looked up the anti-semitic and I didn't know she liked I mean honestly understand the context of like [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1673.72s)]
*  I don't think like it's something like what she said was a kind of what she said [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1679.48s)]
*  I did not see there's this idea that exists not from most Jewish people [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1683.6s)]
*  I know dub has never said this but the idea of being critical being anti-israeli government is somehow [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1687.96s)]
*  Anti-semitic and the article I read literally was like the anti-semitic hate speech of Candice [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1693.08s)]
*  Oh and saying what's happening to the people in Gaza is a genocide committed by the government of Israel. That's not anti-semitic [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1697.6s)]
*  That's not that's an opinion that there's some fact to support the opinion whether you agree or disagree [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1703.04s)]
*  It's an opinion ruin something you're if I'm going to defend if I'm gonna defend Jewish people here. Is it? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1708.52s)]
*  every anti-semite is [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1713.96s)]
*  Critical. Yeah, so the knee-jerk reaction is when you hear critique of it [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1717.12s)]
*  You're like, oh, this is just how they frame their anti-semitism. So it doesn't seem as bad [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1722.92s)]
*  Yeah, every anti-semitic person is anti-israel every person whose anti-israeli government is not anti-semitic [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1728.72s)]
*  Oh 100% but I understand that knee-jerk protective instinct [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1734.44s)]
*  Yeah, right, especially historically what the people have gone through there is that knee-jerk protective insect anytime you hear these buzzwords [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1738.64s)]
*  You're like, uh, here it comes. This is how it happens and to their credit [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1744.4s)]
*  I when October 7th happened and I saw some of the videos of people in Australia chanting like gas [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1747.4s)]
*  Did she was like, oh this anti-semitism is a real fucking thing. Yeah, and I always just kind of was like as a minority [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1752.4s)]
*  I think we're just like that shit ain't that shit is real [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1758.64s)]
*  But just because I acknowledge that that's real and that's fucked up doesn't mean I'm automatically gonna support everything that this government does [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1760.8000000000002s)]
*  That government does not represent all of you. You do not stand for what that government does. These are two different different entities [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1767.5200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I'm curious. Are there any Jewish people that feel what's happening in Gaza is a genocide? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1772.48s)]
*  There's plenty of the not in my name plenty of Jewish people say it's fucked up. I hate this [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1779.16s)]
*  Yes, there's a lot of Jews that are very but it's [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1784.5600000000002s)]
*  We've gone through these opinions or they can suck it. But uh, let me go back to just with Ben and one thing I can agree [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1787.52s)]
*  Sure, he's shown with his platform. He is not the free speech absolutist that maybe he says he is agree completely but if [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1794.88s)]
*  Having one bias for an anomaly of an insane year that's happened where it feels like the world is against one people [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1804.0s)]
*  Or just they felt like really alone in this position to say that he's not done and stayed consistent on a lot of true [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1810.96s)]
*  American conservative values and that's still a big part of his brand like that's where I disagree [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1817.92s)]
*  But I still admit the bias. I don't know what you just said [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1823.76s)]
*  I [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1826.4s)]
*  Jews just became conservative october 8th [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1846.8s)]
*  This idea that like, you know, what a good conservative is is bullshit [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1850.0s)]
*  Then you understand what it means to be a good conservative [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1854.3200000000002s)]
*  Also what it is to be like half of my family is conservative and like traditional like old school [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1857.44s)]
*  American republican, right? They're way different than religious Christian [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1864.4s)]

*  What are we talking about because of the support of israel and yes, they were critical and you've told me that exactly obama's administration [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1889.92s)]
*  Also the rich ones. Okay. Okay, but it doesn't matter. Those things don't matter those things don't matter. Don't don't don't spiral though. Don't spiral here the [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1895.2s)]
*  What i'm trying to say is what it means to be a good conservative [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1903.1200000000001s)]
*  it's like saying uh [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1906.4s)]
*  This is the the most extreme example, but it's just like, uh, yeah, like I mostly didn't fuck kids [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1908.24s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? Like that's what you're saying like he's pretty good. It's like no [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1915.76s)]
*  If you are [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1920.24s)]
*  Remember ben is the conservative i'm not talking about like he can't waver [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1921.76s)]
*  It's like finding out dr umar johnson had sex with a white girl. You go [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1927.28s)]
*  What what? [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1931.6s)]
*  Even one would make you discredit everything everything so this can't you just like what mark said about being an absolute? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1932.8s)]
*  Wavering on [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1940.56s)]
*  the most important [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1943.04s)]
*  Conservative [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1945.98s)]
*  Point of his career which is censorship. That's an important free speak. This is what his career [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1947.2s)]
*  He is a journalist a person in media and completely wavering and being a hypocrite on it [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1953.2s)]
*  to me [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1960.24s)]
*  Doesn't make you go. Oh, well, it's just whatever it just shows an extreme bias [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1961.6s)]
*  And that extreme bias is something that I think the public should be aware of [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1966.56s)]
*  I'm curious. We don't know the details of kandace's contract, but do you think she has a case for like wrongful termination? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1971.36s)]
*  I don't I think I think they mutually agree. Yeah, we don't know if she got fired for sure [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1977.28s)]
*  I think that's also kind of murky maybe she left maybe she got fired whatever but it's clear [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1981.12s)]
*  This wasn't an issue for ben and I think that's what our issue is with him because again you position yourself as the [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1985.04s)]
*  Absolutest of this thing the beacon of free speech now something of a problem with somebody who doesn't agree with something you believe in [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1990.7s)]
*  Yeah, so that's where I think our issue is what was the thing with cotton the new york times guy? [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=1996.5600000000002s)]
*  So tom cotton wrote an op-ed piece that the new york times really conservative last name to be honest [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2001.0400000000002s)]
*  And the new york times fired two editors for publishing it because they felt like the piece was not in there [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2007.92s)]
*  What is that window overton overton window? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2015.92s)]
*  So they fired two editors and I believe ben [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2018.8000000000002s)]
*  Really? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2023.0400000000002s)]
*  You know ran them the riot act for doing that like this is censorship [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2024.16s)]
*  This is breaking down free speech. The op-ed is not representative of the new york times. It is a editorial piece [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2028.0s)]
*  This is literally a section for not the opinions of the new york times [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2034.4s)]
*  And uh, he I think rightfully criticized them [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2038.88s)]
*  I would love to see even if it's a horrible article we all disagree with it'd be nice to see these different ideas out there [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2041.76s)]
*  To get the sense that like we do have this freedom of speech protected by the media [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2047.04s)]
*  So I think he rightfully was very critical [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2052.0s)]
*  And now he's admitting that he has an overton window and that pieces that are outside of that overton window or talent outside of that overton [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2054.2400000000002s)]
*  Window will not be hired by his uh, what is it is him as a publisher? [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2062.0s)]
*  If he had said so to me, sorry just so to me that is blatant bias and hypocrisy and he's made a career [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2067.04s)]
*  Calling people out for being blatantly biased and hypocritical, you know if you want to have no [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2073.52s)]
*  Standards to uphold be a comedian [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2079.9199999999996s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? Just be a clown like us. It's very easy [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2083.2s)]
*  But if you want to rile people up based on their conservatism and what is this country happening? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2086.0s)]
*  I like freedom of speech. We got to fight for the ideals of this american people and make all your fucking cowboy hat movies. Yeah [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2090.96s)]
*  To specifically talk to a group of people. We know exactly what's going on [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2097.2799999999997s)]
*  Guy never been on a horse in his life [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2101.68s)]
*  Right, they know exactly what's happening [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2104.24s)]
*  And then you fall short of your own expectations for other publishers. I think it's I think it's fair game to be criticized [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2107.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. I don't remember what I was gonna say, but yeah, I agree with it and even if it's not [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2113.7599999999998s)]
*  We don't we don't care. Yeah [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2119.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's the best crisis king though [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2122.7999999999997s)]

*  Yo, that's the thing if he said it with if he battled candace [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2144.96s)]
*  If you said it with bars, we would have been like yo ben, whatever. Where's his rap about israel? [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2149.0400000000004s)]

*  We mean a rap man, what are you saying? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2157.52s)]
*  I'd be like, yo we hired candace because of dei and we're repealing our dei so we're no longer gonna have her on [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2159.6s)]
*  How hard is it? Yeah, how hard is it? [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2165.2s)]
*  We hired a black woman because we needed a quota. Yeah, and actually we're not doing quotas anymore [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2167.2s)]
*  And then his face would be like finally [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2171.12s)]
*  Learn how to appeal to your base. Yeah, come on. Yeah, honestly, I don't mean part of it [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2173.68s)]
*  I mean, how did he not see this coming? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2178.88s)]
*  He doesn't like you appeal to right wing christians, of course [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2181.36s)]
*  They're gonna follow the girl who's going yo christ is king [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2184.32s)]
*  I ride for christians and we're not letting anybody talk shit about christians. I'm gonna defend them [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2186.96s)]
*  If you think they're not gonna ride for you, I had a bunch of them. He had matt walsh like who's like super christian [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2191.44s)]
*  Yeah, and walsh's got the trans thing [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2197.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, but he wasn't uh, like going at ben or like attacking the the publisher. What was he saying? [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2200.0s)]
*  Well, he was just like he just does his shit and just talks his thing within the window [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2206.32s)]
*  But if you're talking about hate speech, he said something like I I think if you're a doctor who performs gender-affirming surgery on a trans kid [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2209.44s)]

*  That's why helix has several different mattress models to choose from each designed for specific sleep positions and feel preferences [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2918.18s)]
*  They have models with memory foam layers to provide optimal pressure relief if you sleep on your side [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2924.66s)]
*  Okay [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2929.54s)]
*  They have models with a more responsive foam to cradle your body for essential support in stomach and back sleeping positions plus enhanced cooling [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2930.02s)]
*  Features to keep you from overheating at night. That is absolutely huge. That is the future of mattresses [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2937.38s)]
*  Obviously, you know as the temperature goes up in your room [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2941.94s)]
*  Your sleep can be greatly affected the fact that they're even thinking in this way is genius [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2943.94s)]
*  And if your spine needs some extra tlc, they got you every helix matrix has a hybrid design combining individually [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2948.1800000000003s)]

*  What I suggest is you take that helix sleep quiz and get the perfect mattress for you [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2962.1800000000003s)]
*  I took the quiz actually. I got a helix mattress. I'm genuinely sleeping better on it [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2969.46s)]
*  Uh, it takes like two minutes. They just ask you like what you position you sleep in [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2973.86s)]
*  How often do you move around? How about your partner? How do they sleep? Etc? [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2978.42s)]
*  Very quick great mattress. I got the dusk [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2982.26s)]
*  Lux and it's fantastic and it feels great. My wife fucking loves it sleeps like a baby on it great mattress [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2985.2200000000003s)]
*  Listen, you don't want to take my word for it. That's fine [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2991.78s)]
*  but what you will do is you will take the word of [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2994.34s)]
*  Gq and wire magazine because helix has been awarded the number one mattress picked by both of those [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=2998.02s)]

*  How was the experience on stage? [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3054.58s)]
*  Like this one was more fun because when we did toronto I was just in a blackout the whole time [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3057.14s)]
*  Yeah, so the first time ever doing arena [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3060.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, like I like passed out on the plane and then woke up on the plane back and everything [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3062.58s)]
*  No idea what happened unless I did something wrong, which case I remember everything don't come after me but [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3069.2999999999997s)]
*  While we were there like I was actually able to enjoy it to where like like the first time you do a comedy club [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3073.54s)]
*  You're like, holy shit. This is crazy. Yeah, I think you do a couple times. You're like, oh i'm actually able to be president [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3078.02s)]
*  Yeah, first time you do it. They do like holy fuck. Is this your first time ever you never opened in an arena? [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3081.94s)]
*  Nope, never been in arena. That's uh, toronto was first arena. Yeah. Yep. You never stepped. So what is that like? [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3086.2599999999998s)]
*  Oh, that's crazy, bro. I did an arena before him. Yeah, he did [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3092.18s)]
*  Let's fire which I understand like I want the first time I do an arena to be when I do an arena but [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3100.1s)]
*  The that means the first time you're doing an arena. Yeah, you're doing the it's your show. Everything is on your shoulders [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3105.2999999999997s)]
*  What are you thinking when you walk out there? Wow [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3111.54s)]
*  I mean I think in like the in toronto the first time is like, okay [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3113.54s)]
*  What is the pacing going to be you always hear people talk about that in bigger venues? [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3117.06s)]
*  Like are you gonna have to go slower and these types of things? Did you go slower? What'd you do? Uh, I [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3121.06s)]
*  to me it didn't feel slower because [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3126.02s)]
*  I'm always trying to adjust to [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3128.5s)]
*  The energy i'm getting so it doesn't feel slow [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3130.98s)]
*  because [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3134.3399999999997s)]
*  It feels on pace [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3135.54s)]
*  With what i'm getting from them, right? Right, right. Does that make sense? But [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3137.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so I don't really I didn't really feel like oh i'm talking much slower. It's yeah. Yeah, but [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3141.14s)]
*  But yeah, just the wave of energy that yeah, like a big laugh is just this [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3147.2999999999997s)]
*  I think uh do have all said it best is like, you know, it feels like uh [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3152.42s)]
*  Like everybody's hugging you at the same time and it is just like an intense fucking feeling man [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3156.42s)]
*  and also just yeah seeing that made people laugh and like [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3162.1s)]
*  when you when [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3165.3799999999997s)]
*  You can see the bodies move [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3166.66s)]
*  And you kind of like catch them in your periphery like the the the movement like somebody laughing just going [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3169.14s)]
*  something like that like [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3174.5s)]
*  I don't know to me [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3176.2599999999998s)]
*  It's very easy to just kind of [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3178.5s)]
*  Not lock into one person and just kind of like see everybody at the same time [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3180.5s)]
*  And then those moments will lock you into one specific person that's really enjoying something [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3184.66s)]
*  Sometimes you can get locked into the person not enjoying. Yeah, that's the thing to fight with [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3188.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it was just it was just awesome and the forum is a dope fucking room [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3192.66s)]
*  Was that bigger than toronto it looked in the picture look it felt smaller in the way that the building is shaped [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3195.7s)]
*  It's really intimate. So some of these arenas are go go. No, I was gonna say the big difference [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3201.46s)]
*  Also, there's no suites. This is this building's from like 1967 or 68 [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3206.3399999999997s)]
*  Same architect is msg [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3210.8199999999997s)]
*  So it's round and not long and overly the sweet thing is is is crucial because [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3212.9s)]
*  You can charge so much money for the suites like you charge these corporations money and they buy them because it's so fucking write-off [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3218.98s)]
*  But what they do is they create this separation [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3224.66s)]
*  Yes, the 300 section is and then the high sections [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3228.34s)]
*  and so there's less intimacy you would say than [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3232.26s)]
*  In the in these ones that were built before the idea of suites like it feels weirdly intimate for such a crazy room [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3236.66s)]
*  Yeah, as well every time when we go into the room for the first time [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3242.5s)]
*  It is [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3247.3s)]
*  Jaw-dropping for me. Yeah like [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3249.78s)]
*  Uh and also pulling up [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3252.2599999999998s)]
*  Like I think in in your life or in career you get so used to like what is the next thing we have to do [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3256.2599999999998s)]
*  You know, you're like what else can we that sometimes you don't even you have to like remind yourself to like focus and enjoy [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3262.66s)]
*  The thing in front of you like it's something I like try to intentionally do like I don't want to look back [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3268.1s)]
*  When my daughter's like 18 and you know, she's like, so what was it like when you were doing comedy all the time? [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3273.7799999999997s)]
*  And I don't want to be like I don't know I didn't really focus on it [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3279.46s)]
*  I was focused on the next thing and I you know [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3282.1000000000004s)]
*  I was worried about this thing and that thing and how can we do this better like [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3284.26s)]
*  So there's like a moment where it's how do we be? [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3287.78s)]
*  Intentional like lock the fuck in and seeing the venue from the outside was like [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3291.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that was you know, it's a little crazy about that. I don't know. I I should have fun [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3296.5800000000004s)]
*  You know what's crazy about driving up difference like [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3300.34s)]
*  MSG parked in the middle of the city [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3303.1200000000003s)]
*  Kidding [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3305.2s)]
*  You're in la so there's thousands of parking spots around so you just see one round building [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3307.2799999999997s)]
*  And that fucking coliseum you own you own several city blocks for that night [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3313.04s)]
*  and you pull in and then it's just did you feel the [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3317.44s)]
*  Forum club like we had the forum club before and after that's like showtime lakers. I mean jack nicholson and yeah [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3320.72s)]
*  Magic getting aids. Yeah [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3327.12s)]
*  Yeah, is that what hiv yeah [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3330.08s)]
*  Or he gave it [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3334.56s)]
*  Both probably probably in that very room. I thought I was gonna say champagne. What else? No, well the champagne led to the hiv [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3336.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's just like a magic [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3342.72s)]
*  That was the free golf before the free golf [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3346.48s)]
*  That's funny anyway, so it's just so cool. Thank you everybody that came out that was awesome and uh [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3349.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, i'm just really grateful it was and I feel like we put on a put on a really good show that is [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3355.44s)]
*  That is always the the cool feeling to leave with [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3361.04s)]
*  Yeah, you know where you feel like proud of the show that you gave the people and I think that [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3364.08s)]
*  I think we did top to bottom. I feel really good about the show like from when you walk in [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3369.44s)]
*  You know that it has begun [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3374.72s)]
*  You know and uh, and it's something we take really seriously in in terms of like [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3376.72s)]
*  How do you scale a show like this for venues like that? [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3380.56s)]
*  It's not like we're just walking out. We have one fucking light and then there's a microphone and then that's it [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3382.96s)]
*  And I think a lot of times [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3387.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, some people they don't change their show to accommodate the viewing experience [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3390.08s)]
*  For the consumer when they're now in an arena and you can do it [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3394.4s)]
*  It costs fucking a lot of money to do it, which we will gladly spend because we're grateful people showing up [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3398.72s)]
*  But that's I think the difference [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3404.32s)]
*  Because you can create that intimacy and now you have [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3407.12s)]
*  That it's not the same as a club with 200 people but you have intimacy [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3410.56s)]
*  But now you're laughing with 13 000 people and that feeling is different [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3413.84s)]
*  Like that is yeah. Yeah now speaking on the intimacy of the show [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3418.7999999999997s)]
*  So I went to the drake concert over the weekend. I wanted to come out yours, but [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3423.12s)]
*  My little baby girl still not vaccinated so I can't fly with her yet. You know, you're done [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3427.2799999999997s)]
*  My baby girl, yeah, i'm a father now [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3432.72s)]
*  I love seeing an album coming dog guy. This guy's crazy [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3435.84s)]
*  Fucking anyway, go on [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3438.8s)]
*  Do you walk the dog? You don't even walk the dog, right? We can't yeah, she's not she actually got her last vaccination today [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3440.88s)]
*  So she can't no you can't oh we got to talk about that too, but go on go on [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3445.92s)]
*  So yeah went to the drake concert and you've been to it [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3449.76s)]
*  It's not that much different from the one he was doing with 21 [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3452.32s)]
*  He switched a few things like but it is it feels so intimate because he has he's right in the center [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3455.28s)]
*  And then he lets the whole floor come to him. Yeah, and then throughout the show [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3460.8s)]
*  He's like talking to people in this section in that section [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3464.48s)]
*  Like he makes a giant arena venue look like or feel like a small intimate show [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3466.96s)]
*  Is he doing the thing where he wraps off beat still? No, he stopped that he stopped that [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3472.08s)]
*  So he stopped that you could rap along with the show. It's a lot better now [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3476.4s)]
*  Um, he does take a few shots at kendrick here in the oh really subliminals, of course [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3479.6800000000003s)]
*  He never says his name, but I really feel like [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3484.48s)]
*  kendrick wants him to shoot first because i've heard [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3488.0s)]
*  Through a source that kendrick has two confirmed districts like ready to go [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3491.52s)]
*  Why don't you just drop them? That's what drake did on meek. That was so brilliant. It's just run it up [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3497.2s)]
*  It's a good point. Yeah kendrick drops back to back then back to back to back [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3501.84s)]
*  drake got it, but I think like we all know drake is tested and so if he drops first and then if drake [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3506.88s)]
*  Sees what he drops and then comes with something harder then it's like [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3513.28s)]
*  A harder battle for kendrick, but I do think [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3516.56s)]
*  This is my suspicion but uh, there's dreamville this coming weekend [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3520.2400000000002s)]
*  And I think drake might have a surprise pop up and maybe that's when we get to this trip. Oh wow [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3524.4s)]
*  Oh shit, that'd be like i'll do it live. I think so. That's just a guess that I have [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3529.6s)]
*  Yeah, but he's not confirmed for dreamville. So if i'm wrong, fuck you guys. Do you think that they're in on this together? [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3535.28s)]
*  Which who kendrick and drake? [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3541.76s)]
*  Nah [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3544.0s)]
*  Definitely not. No, this is like true [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3544.96s)]
*  competition like [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3548.0600000000004s)]
*  Everybody's been saying they're number one number two [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3549.6800000000003s)]
*  So it's like they really want to just settle the score like see and they've been taking like low-key shots each other for a while [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3551.76s)]
*  Yeah for and that's why i'm like jennifer and cole apparently also have been taking shots at each other subliminally for a while [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3556.4s)]
*  yeah, but not as much as yeah, judge a good drake like of course, they've been going at each other and [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3562.32s)]
*  like [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3567.6800000000003s)]
*  People are saying this last track on metro shit is like the first diss track, but it's not he never said drake's name [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3568.48s)]
*  So it's like when are you going to actually say his name? That's when a district is a district [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3574.8s)]
*  If you just keep even though they're subliminal, they're very very clear. They're not that sub they're liminals, but still [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3579.44s)]
*  If it's a district say the person's name, that's how I feel about it [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3586.0s)]
*  But I guess what i'm the reason why I asked you think they're in it because who benefits the most from this [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3589.92s)]
*  Them the both of them right? Yeah, and [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3594.8s)]
*  Drake is in a position now where it's like there's nothing else that he can do [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3597.36s)]
*  I feel almost yeah, you've been on top of the game for over a decade [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3600.8s)]
*  You've made all different types of music. You broke all different types of artists. Like what else is there left? [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3604.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, but it's way more upside for kendrick [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3610.56s)]
*  Yeah, I think drake is a lot more to lose. Of course, of course, of course, but like [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3612.88s)]
*  There's there is upside for kenrick [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3618.0800000000004s)]
*  But also kendrick is in such a different position in that like he's looked at [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3619.92s)]
*  as this [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3624.48s)]
*  Like artsy rapper who only comes out every you know [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3625.92s)]
*  What is it four years or whatever? He's dropping a project or three years [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3630.16s)]
*  He's dropping a project whereas drake is looked at as probably the number one mainstream guy right now [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3632.96s)]
*  That's like curating culture drake is i've probably seen widely by people younger than us as the greatest ever and maybe people are age [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3639.44s)]
*  I don't know. Yeah, he's like he's like the lebron notes, but they both but they both [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3645.6800000000003s)]
*  In my opinion, it's like they both benefit from this because now drake doesn't need relevance [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3649.44s)]
*  But now there's something to be interested in him outside [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3654.08s)]
*  Of just another album and he's dropping album album album music is great. We love it. His catalog is insane [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3657.8399999999997s)]
*  We love it. But why are we into you now like give us the thing? That's true. Now we got a thing [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3664.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and then kendrick is i'm adding gonna drop a new project [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3669.52s)]
*  Soon, I assume [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3674.3199999999997s)]
*  Never know what yeah, that's true, but I assume it's like maybe let me start boiling things up [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3676.48s)]
*  Let me get things going for when I drop and now i'm gonna drop [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3680.4s)]
*  While there's peak interest in me [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3684.48s)]
*  Like i'll drop in the middle of a beef [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3687.04s)]
*  Here's the one thing I would say for drake the longer he doesn't respond [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3689.44s)]
*  I don't know. Maybe people will forget at some point [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3693.92s)]
*  But I was looking at comments on like an academics post or a grand wizard post or something and a bunch of the comments are like drake [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3695.44s)]
*  It's about it's time to fucking respond like let's go. I'm tired of defending. Is that real or that people could forget that [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3700.7200000000003s)]
*  Or you know if he doesn't respond [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3706.8s)]
*  I think drake if he responds has more to lose than kendrick because more people say drake is the best ever [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3708.88s)]
*  Than kendrick is the best. I mean like drake. I think drake is teflon and like he already [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3714.0s)]
*  Lost the battle and he's better off [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3719.28s)]
*  Like he already got the worst [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3722.6400000000003s)]
*  Scarlet letter you can put on a rapper and he's still flawless like [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3725.1800000000003s)]
*  Like two is two though and push is not kendrick in terms of the perception people have of them [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3730.32s)]
*  Push it he's not somebody that people think was ever competing with drake. Yeah, but I think push is a better [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3734.24s)]
*  battle rapper if you will not that he's a battler but like then [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3741.2799999999997s)]
*  Kendrick like kendrick. I see like more like artsy storytelling and great rhymes, but I don't see him as like a dis you [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3746.24s)]
*  make you look crazy, dude, whereas like [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3752.72s)]
*  See, I don't think I mean it makes sense [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3756.24s)]
*  I I think I see what you're saying [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3758.08s)]
*  But to be fair we would have never thought push ahead it would have a diss track that would go that crazy [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3759.28s)]
*  until [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3764.88s)]
*  Was a story of adidon I think it's called. Yeah. No, no 100 100 100 [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3766.0800000000004s)]
*  Don't give 100. I guess I wonder if he just feels like there's nothing that can happen to him [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3770.48s)]
*  Yeah, I think yeah, I think he feels like me responding. There's more to lose and gain [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3774.1600000000003s)]
*  Drake oh, I don't think he's hesitating on on like I don't think he's scared to respond. I think he's [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3779.1200000000003s)]
*  I think he is really I don't want to say scare because again, I I am a drake hater [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3784.96s)]
*  I still don't think I give it up [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3789.84s)]
*  But i'm so I don't want to say he's scared but he's just looking at it logically and being like why would I yeah? [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3791.52s)]
*  What upside is there for me to respond? [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3796.64s)]
*  Because he's looked at at the top of the game right now if he lets two three months go by everybody forgets this [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3798.08s)]
*  Nobody's talking about it [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3803.6s)]
*  So he could just stay at his position if he responds and then kendrick's shit is better now [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3804.88s)]
*  That confirms kendrick is the top is better [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3809.76s)]
*  But if he goes crazy and his shit is better than kendrick's and it's like undisputed. Yeah [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3812.08s)]
*  So no one can touch him. No one's gonna fall with him. Hi race. Hi reward [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3815.84s)]
*  If i'm drake i'm so tight [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3819.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah, he's like i'm just like yo if i'm drake i'm like I help everybody [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3822.16s)]
*  I give everybody a feature. I support everybody. I put everybody on [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3827.12s)]
*  I take so many chances on so many artists and really try to uplift them [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3832.7200000000003s)]
*  And I gotta deal with this motherfucker who barely comes out ever [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3837.36s)]
*  Making a diss track about me so that he can be looked out as number one where i'm dropping an album every single fucking year [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3841.2s)]
*  I'm still on top of the game like i'll be annoyed [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3846.96s)]
*  I would look at low key as clout chasing [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3850.0s)]
*  I'd be like bro, like I [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3852.4s)]
*  Literally, i'm just i'm i'm i'm drake. I'm like i'm a good guy [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3854.2400000000002s)]
*  I am helping people who is kendrick putting on [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3858.7200000000003s)]
*  That part is true who is he can't say he's a good guy because he has been taking shots too if he took no shots back [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3862.72s)]
*  Then that's fair. He could say who really started it [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3867.76s)]
*  It's hard [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3870.88s)]
*  Some shots to control kendrick started it a decade 12 years ago or whatever the fuck with control. Okay, but kendrick started it [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3872.96s)]
*  I also give that to kendrick kendrick has always been I never looked at it [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3879.52s)]
*  Maybe now it's bad blood or whatever but control we all just looked at like oh this guy wants it fire [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3882.8s)]
*  Yeah, that verse when he said to everybody let's go this is rap i'm taking shots [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3887.9199999999996s)]
*  Still get me on like the consumer it's awesome for the consumer wins, but I imagine if i'm drake it's like I am [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3892.16s)]
*  putting out so much goodwill in this [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3898.08s)]
*  brutally competitive hateful [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3901.3399999999997s)]
*  genre of entertainment all of entertainment is fucking like hateful and competitive but this is brutally competitive in that like you can actually talk [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3904.7999999999997s)]
*  Shit about one another actors can't do that [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3911.6s)]
*  You know what I mean, like if fucking brad pitt and george cluny have beef they don't act it out [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3914.56s)]
*  In in rap you can actually do it [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3919.84s)]
*  And he's got so much goodwill for everything he's done and he's still getting people talking shit [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3921.92s)]
*  I do think though the other rappers choosing sides too, which is even crazier [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3926.32s)]
*  Like you see ross turning on them future metro. You saw lebron mouth in the kendrick verse. Well, yeah, what do you think about that? [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3930.2400000000002s)]

*  I think it's yeah, what do you think the i'm not trying to be dickhead with any calculation saying [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3941.6s)]

*  So I can maybe see him being like this is me furthering that image [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3956.08s)]
*  Look, I know the words of this song that came out two weeks. I'm in the culture still [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3959.84s)]

*  Maybe he didn't bring kendrick on the shop. He brought drake on the shop [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3967.76s)]
*  And said something like you never had to respond to push. I love you no matter what I think you're great [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3971.44s)]

*  maybe there's something going on behind behind the scenes where [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3980.2400000000002s)]
*  People have a reason to be upset at drake because it's weird like drake and ross have been cool for [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=3984.08s)]

*  Let's get back to the show. Yo, shut up trump bro. What did he do? [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=4895.66s)]
*  Well, he's indicted or what he owes what 175 million in like 10 days [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=4900.3s)]
*  Yeah, he posted it he posted. Yeah guy got the money, but they were coming at our boy john stewart and I didn't like it [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=4904.38s)]
*  I looked at well, wow, what happened? What is john stewart did a whole daily show piece about what trump did? [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=4910.14s)]
*  which is basically like he would massively [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=4914.46s)]
*  Lie about the like the size of a home he had it would be 10 000 square feet and it said 30 [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=4917.5s)]
*  It's 30 000 square feet inflate the value of his so that would inflate the value of his property [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=4922.54s)]
*  Then he would go to the bank and be like hey, let me get this massive loan at a lower interest rate [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=4926.78s)]
*  Because i'm worth so much money. Look how much I have in hold. There's no risk [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=4931.34s)]
*  No risk you guys can just have that if I default on it. So he would get a lower interest rate [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=4934.78s)]
*  He got found guilty of that and the judge ordered him to pay 450 million dollars, which is what the judge said [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=4938.7s)]
*  Those loans with interest would have cost you or what that's how much you made on it [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=4945.179999999999s)]
*  And then he pays that to whom he pays that to the city of new york. And what do they do with it? [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=4949.5s)]
*  Give it back to the people through whatever the taxes of the migrants give us the migrants exactly. That's what we do [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=4953.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but the problem so that [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=4959.1s)]
*  The bigger issue is stewart does this piece and I think the point of stewart's thing was like he kind of goes at kevin [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=4961.58s)]
*  O'leary from shark tank. Yes, pretty hard because kevin o'leary is like dude. We all do this [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=4966.22s)]
*  This is we're all all my friends are scared like what's gonna happen to us and he's like [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=4969.58s)]
*  Rich people are so used to breaking the law that they're like we broke the law and we got punished [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=4973.18s)]
*  What the fuck this is and his point is I think more so [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=4977.660000000001s)]
*  What you guys don't understand is if poor people do this they get thrown in jail if you lie about your [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=4980.94s)]
*  Net worth to get a car loan and they find out you get punished. That's not something you just get away with [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=4985.18s)]
*  That's not true. Whether or not that's it new york post does an article like john stewart does the exact same thing [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=4989.26s)]
*  He sold the house in tribeca for 17 million dollars. Its assessed value is 1.4 million 1.84. Yeah [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=4994.62s)]
*  These are I looked into it is completely different things. I talked to a realtor friend [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5001.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah of mine, you might know from miami, but he uh, basically said this assessed value is just the city sounds artificial [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5004.54s)]
*  And they have their own metrics and they say this is how much we think the property is worth [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5010.86s)]
*  You get taxed a percentage of that net worth 1.8 million [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5014.46s)]
*  The free market decides what the apartment somebody really wants to buy john stewart's house then they can pay whatever he wants [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5018.3s)]
*  He didn't lie about the square foot. It's a 6 000 square foot tribeca duplex [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5024.14s)]
*  With a 1200 square foot private roof an 800 square foot terrace 17 million is not that crazy for this property [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5028.7s)]
*  You might have overpaid because it's john stewart's but like I looked up pictures. I saw I sent it to mazuma [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5035.34s)]
*  He overpaid significantly, but he sells it down the road for 13 million [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5040.54s)]
*  So it's not like it's a 1 million dollar house that he sold for 17 25 loss on a piece of real estate [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5043.9s)]
*  Which is in minhattan. It's very hard to do but it doesn't mean that that john has done something illegal [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5049.0199999999995s)]
*  But let's not undermine what's happening also the guy could have sold because he needs money. Sometimes a guy goes broke [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5054.139999999999s)]
*  A lot of these really trends of properties. You'll see mark down more than you would [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5060.379999999999s)]
*  $100,000 house because it's just there's more room and the guy needs the money now or whatever [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5064.04s)]
*  Sure, we don't know what those circumstances are but we know john stewart just sold a house [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5067.66s)]
*  But you're allowed to sell your house for whatever price you want [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5071.26s)]
*  So he did nothing wrong and actually sent the my friend our friend the article and he was like, oh this is a complete hit piece [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5074.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he did say what's happening to trump. He was like every real estate person does this [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5080.139999999999s)]
*  That's that the thing isn't whether or not it's wrong. The thing is people have this trump derangement syndrome [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5083.9s)]
*  where anything that he does [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5090.94s)]
*  They will grab onto and be like what an absolute animal to do something like this when they don't realize [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5093.74s)]
*  that [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5100.7s)]
*  Not only is john taking the position of protecting the banks like his position is but the bank could have got hurt [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5101.66s)]
*  You know that bank well john says I don't give poor people out of their home john says I don't give a fuck about the bank [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5109.66s)]
*  He said no, I know he doesn't but the only person that can get hurt in this situation [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5115.099999999999s)]
*  I understand in the piece he was like well those loans could have went out to some other people which they couldn't have [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5118.7s)]
*  Yeah, there's never the bank never goes. Oh, we're out of money. Yeah, the whole idea of fractional reserve banking is there's always more money [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5125.26s)]
*  Yeah, so an entire housing collapse is built on this idea [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5131.26s)]
*  Yeah, there's always more money and they will give you they can't wait to give you money if you meet the stipulation [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5134.46s)]
*  So I don't think that that was fair. I don't think it's a fair hit piece on john [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5139.0199999999995s)]
*  It's at all, but it's also a hit piece on trump [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5142.78s)]
*  He's not doing anything that any other developer in new york doesn't do and it's up to the banks to vet these things [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5145.66s)]
*  Yeah, banks just go oh because we believed it. Yeah, that's on the banks now [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5151.26s)]
*  I was thinking maybe they're coming after him mainly because he's trump [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5155.34s)]
*  Secondarily, I was wondering if the banks feel embarrassed like dude. We got got so fucking hard, but they didn't get caught [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5158.76s)]
*  They got paid back everybody made money. There's it's a victimous crime [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5163.18s)]
*  That's what kevin o'leary is basically saying like if somebody lost money [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5166.46s)]
*  Okay clip them but the developer that he was working with was like, yeah, we made money the banks got their money back [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5169.1s)]
*  Everybody made money [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5174.86s)]
*  So yeah, why is he paying 450 million dollars to the city or to the state? [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5176.62s)]
*  If there's a victim who lost 450 million dollars pay him that and like how dare you but if nobody lost money [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5181.82s)]
*  He beat the system and that's kind of what happens. Did some people think they were gonna make more money [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5188.86s)]
*  Say again, did some people think they were gonna make more money? [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5194.06s)]
*  I I would have to look in that I think he made more money because of it [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5195.9s)]
*  But I think the bank made back the interest that they want. That's what they're looking forward to [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5199.1s)]
*  Still a version of fraud like if you're lying on this document to get a loan and you're [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5203.26s)]
*  Lying about how much you're worth. It's still I would look at it like [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5208.62s)]
*  Like you're still committed a crime. Maybe the severity of the crime is not that crazy, but it's still a crime [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5212.78s)]
*  My feeling is like you can't commit the fraud if they don't verify it [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5217.82s)]
*  Like do we really think? [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5222.22s)]
*  That the bank isn't verifying this shit like I can't fathom the bank like you bought a house [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5224.54s)]
*  The the amount of bullshit that you got to go through to buy a house [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5231.58s)]
*  The amount of legal bull the bureaucracy the amount of checks and credit and everything that you have to buy a piece of property [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5236.219999999999s)]
*  I cannot fathom when it comes to hundreds of millions of dollars of property [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5245.0199999999995s)]
*  They're just gonna be like how much did trump be say was worth? All right, I believe him [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5249.0199999999995s)]
*  The banks know the developers are scumbags [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5253.419999999999s)]
*  They know they are acutely aware of how scummy they are and they're literally looking for margin anywhere they can get it [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5256.14s)]
*  So they develop systems to protect against them for whatever reason they let that shit go [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5262.7s)]
*  I'm just saying like this isn't there are plenty of things you can be critical of trump about [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5268.86s)]
*  Yeah, this isn't the what is it? Uh, the the hill to die on or whatever the cross to christ christ king [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5272.46s)]
*  Uh, um, could it be what you often say to like you talk about the I think you had a drug dealer and brilliant idiots [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5278.62s)]
*  And he was like man. I got seven years for a crime. I didn't commit [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5284.06s)]
*  And you were like did you do other crimes that you could have gotten? [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5286.54s)]
*  Could it be the same thing with trump? [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5289.42s)]
*  Yeah, 100 but get him on those like and get him on the ones where they're victims [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5291.42s)]
*  like that those to me like I always joke around about like him not paying that it be um, [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5295.9800000000005s)]
*  The contractors and how he's my hero because the contracts are taking forever to like do any fucking renovation [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5300.38s)]
*  I want to do I keep spending more money. I joke about it [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5305.660000000001s)]
*  but if there are of those contractors those families that the whole business went under because they couldn't afford to pay their [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5308.06s)]
*  bills and like those people really hurt [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5314.06s)]
*  That's to me a more compelling story if you're trying to assassinate this man's character [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5317.1s)]
*  Yeah, to me that's more interesting than oh bank of america didn't count the square footage [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5321.660000000001s)]
*  And then he able was able to get a loan that he paid back and everybody made money on [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5327.1s)]
*  Yeah, I honestly don't I don't know. I don't think he should be prosecuted, but i'm playing devil's advocate [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5331.820000000001s)]
*  Again to your point. This is the thing that can get him on so he got away with these other things that we can't get him on [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5337.34s)]
*  We can get him on this so you're saying this is the uh, didn't pay his taxes shit for uh, [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5341.66s)]
*  Capone he made enough enemies and now they're gonna get them on whatever they can so are you mad that he got [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5347.26s)]
*  Not mad, but do you feel that it's the hit piece by john or the fact that he was even prosecuted is what's unfair [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5352.14s)]
*  Oh, I don't think I don't care about the john thing. Like I do whatever you want. I think it's I [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5359.34s)]
*  My my feeling is prosecuting him for this [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5363.58s)]
*  is only going to embolden his base and [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5367.5s)]
*  for [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5371.9800000000005s)]
*  And rightfully so like if i'm a big trump guy and I see this guy who's like under attack [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5372.9400000000005s)]
*  That's my and then you see this thing happening [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5378.06s)]
*  And if you have any idea of like how real estate in this city or any city works [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5380.3s)]
*  You're like this is what they all kind of fucking do [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5384.38s)]
*  Like we're really just targeting this guy now it justifies that yeah, they are targeting your guy now [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5386.9400000000005s)]
*  You're gonna lean in 10 times more [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5392.22s)]
*  but do you think like say whoever discovered that he was doing this or like, uh, let's just [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5395.1s)]
*  Let him do it because we don't want to make his base [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5401.58s)]
*  But like they should I feel like they should still bring the charges against them [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5404.38s)]
*  I think if you prosecuted more other rich people it might be a thing [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5407.58s)]
*  But here's the thing maybe that starts maybe that does because you guys say it like oh everybody's doing this and I [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5411.18s)]
*  I wasn't aware that everybody's doing this. I wasn't aware. I think that I think that is john's point is like earnings [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5416.62s)]
*  Rich people just tend to get away with financial crime. Let me let me let me put [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5422.3s)]
*  well [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5426.86s)]
*  People with finances are the only ones that can get away with financial crime. It's not like [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5427.66s)]
*  You could lie to qualify for food stamps. I think was an example of john [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5433.099999999999s)]
*  They do that all the time poor people do that all the time. I think people get upset about it [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5436.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but they're not going to jail. They're not forced to pay back the food. So like how many of our friends like claims someone else's kid? [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5439.82s)]
*  Like that was the big thing growing up. Like if your friends had a kid you claimed them as a dependent like well [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5446.46s)]
*  I think they stopped doing that because the irs started cracking down on it, right? [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5452.3s)]
*  Now you can't do you they close that loophole up. Are you certain of that or yeah, you don't hear that joke nearly as much anymore [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5456.3s)]
*  I'm fairly certain. I'm 99 certain tax people have told me yeah, the irs is cracking down on this dependent shit [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5462.38s)]
*  You're not just getting around you're not getting away with that anymore. Got it. Got it. Which I again I think and I'm not even necessarily [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5467.9800000000005s)]
*  Saying I love john. I don't agree with everything. It says I don't really agree with this piece [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5472.860000000001s)]
*  But I think that's his point which I can understand [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5475.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but this is not something the irs needs to crack down on there's already a rule in place that it's not allowed [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5477.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, right, right. So the the rules are there. It's how it's prosecuted [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5484.62s)]
*  If the rule gets removed that you can't claim dependence that is something entirely different [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5490.0599999999995s)]
*  It's up to in this circumstance. I believe the banks to make sure that whoever they're loaning money to [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5495.42s)]
*  Is capable of paying it back [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5503.58s)]
*  It is in their best interest to do it if i'm the bank and I find out that this person defrauded us [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5505.099999999999s)]
*  I'm firing every single person in the division [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5510.54s)]
*  Like we got i'm basically we got lucky that he ended up paying it back [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5513.0199999999995s)]
*  But I can't trust y'all to run this fucking business to me. That is how you punish this [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5516.06s)]
*  Now, yeah fair, but is there everybody does it? Let me give you an example [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5521.42s)]
*  Let me give you sorry [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5524.78s)]
*  Is there not a rule in place that says you can't lie about these things to get a loan and [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5525.58s)]
*  I would assume that's a rule in place that sure there's there's there's definitely a rule where it's like be honest about your things [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5530.14s)]
*  But I also think that those things are checked example of this [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5536.38s)]
*  You look at an apartment in new york city a lot of people don't know this but [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5539.58s)]
*  If you were in like a walk-up in new york city the stairwell [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5543.34s)]
*  Can be considered part of your square footage for your floor [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5547.02s)]
*  So you might have 800 square feet in your apartment and then a 200 square foot stairwell [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5550.9400000000005s)]
*  You list that as a thousand square feet [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5557.18s)]
*  Now you don't really have a thousand square feet. You have 800 square feet [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5560.3s)]
*  Right, so the price of your apartment is based on a square footage [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5564.299999999999s)]
*  Is it 2,000 a foot is it 4,000 foot but is it 2,000 a foot based on a thousand or 800 now? [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5567.9s)]
*  It is legal to include the square footage [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5574.62s)]
*  Should it be is that something that they should change because you're really talking about a dwelling that's a shared stairwell [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5577.66s)]
*  That's not your actual space. There's so many little fucking [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5583.42s)]
*  Little angles and shit that you can push pull within real estate [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5587.34s)]
*  I'm not saying that this is the exact same thing [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5591.0199999999995s)]
*  But here's an example of how the average everyday person you you you me [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5592.94s)]
*  Would list our apartment. Yeah, but I I can see that because if you get around the system legally then good [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5598.38s)]
*  Take advantage of everything you can get out of the system. But if you're doing it illegally [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5604.62s)]
*  10,000 to 30,000 playing here for everybody [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5609.98s)]
*  Here's something here's something illegal that every single right now you go onto any website in new york city [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5612.38s)]
*  My apartment right now is [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5619.02s)]
*  The apartment that I live in with my wife [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5622.46s)]
*  And our baby nurse [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5625.5s)]
*  Is listed as a three-bedroom apartment [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5627.660000000001s)]
*  It is a one-bedroom apartment that has a dining alcove and then a [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5632.46s)]
*  mezzanine it's called [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5640.54s)]
*  It is legally a one-bedroom apartment in order to be a bedroom in new york city [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5643.18s)]
*  You need a window and a closet and I guess yeah, that's right in a closet [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5648.38s)]
*  They illegally list it as a three-bedroom apartment [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5653.0199999999995s)]
*  They illegally use that i'm sure to inflate the value of their building [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5657.0199999999995s)]
*  They illegally obtain loans based on [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5662.62s)]
*  Three bedroom listings because you charge four or more so they are illegally doing this [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5667.34s)]
*  Nothing's happening. They're not being sued the developer is not suing them. They're not having to pay the city [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5673.1s)]
*  Like this is you go on any real estate website right now yours when you bought yours [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5680.7s)]
*  They probably said one or not bought yours when you rented yours. They're probably one bedroom or something like that [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5685.0199999999995s)]
*  fake one bedroom fake [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5690.3s)]
*  Right, but so this is like the smallest version of it [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5692.54s)]
*  What i'm saying is like they're all doing it and we will do it when we have the opportunity to [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5695.98s)]
*  Yeah, when you sell your place [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5702.22s)]
*  You're gonna go [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5704.86s)]
*  Every square inch of everything [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5706.22s)]
*  I've been saying what i'm saying is it's just not the hill to die on with trump like [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5708.94s)]
*  Go after him for the things that are legit [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5712.3s)]
*  But don't go after him for the things that he does that everybody in his field fucking does [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5714.86s)]
*  Yeah, because it's just gonna look like what it actually is, which is a fucking hit piece again [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5719.66s)]
*  I agree. It's it's just they're just trying to get trump because they don't like them. I think I said at the top [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5724.78s)]
*  That's the main thing also 10 000 square feet to 30 000 square feet is a huge lie [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5728.62s)]
*  And I think this is the thing they can get him on [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5733.66s)]
*  It's hard to get him on some of these other things probably [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5736.54s)]
*  Yeah, otherwise they I think would have gotten them because they don't like them. They want them out of here [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5739.34s)]
*  But this is the thing they can get I don't even think they get them on this [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5743.26s)]
*  I don't think they do either and I do think it only serves to embolden his fan base [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5746.06s)]
*  But right now this is the thing they can get but and and when I when I say they I just want to be very [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5748.94s)]
*  careful here, I don't even know if it's a [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5753.74s)]
*  Organized hit [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5757.66s)]
*  I think it could also be people trying to make their career off of trump [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5759.34s)]
*  Absolutely, so it's not as nefarious as like seven people the dnc saying hey you go get them you go get them [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5765.58s)]
*  You go get Hillary Clinton's the actual attorney that's suing him dude, but it's also party politics as well [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5771.179999999999s)]
*  No, there's definitely party politics, but it's also there's a da who's like oh i'm gonna make my career off taking down trump [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5776.78s)]
*  It is so what i'm saying is you don't even care like not even you but like [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5783.66s)]
*  The person that's doing it doesn't even care about the people the good people in new york or the banks or whatever [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5788.78s)]
*  They care about forward progress in their career and they're using this person to do it when they go private [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5795.58s)]
*  They can be like yo, i'm the one guy that got money from trump. Yeah, so it's everybody is faking it [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5802.7s)]
*  Yeah, which is the game don't get me wrong [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5808.22s)]
*  You're 100 but when I call out one part of the game when everybody's playing the game [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5810.62s)]
*  So so it's the same thing. I guess with like trans visibility day. Yeah, which is like [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5815.18s)]
*  And we were having this conversation before where it's like you get to a certain point where you're like [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5821.26s)]
*  If everything's fake [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5825.82s)]
*  Why is nobody acknowledging this and how do we trust any piece of information? [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5828.06s)]
*  like [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5833.66s)]
*  Trans visibility day biden declares it you knew when you printed it [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5834.52s)]
*  Yeah, that he didn't declare fucking easter sunday trans visibility day. This was a [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5839.34s)]
*  Clerical not i'm won't even call clerical. There's a timing thing. Yeah, really like [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5845.0s)]
*  It's honestly catholics flipping the fucking day every year [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5850.38s)]
*  When you think about it, right? Yeah, so [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5854.3s)]
*  And the same thing with this and it's just like when everything is just bullshit do you just play the game as well? [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5858.38s)]
*  Knowing that you're a liar [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5866.3s)]
*  Or do you call out the truth? [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5868.62s)]
*  Like yeah, what do you what are you doing? That's it I feel like the [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5873.820000000001s)]
*  Making fun of how absurd it is that everybody's just going along with a lie john stewart is the position but john knows [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5876.9400000000005s)]
*  john knows better [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5884.860000000001s)]
*  He knows better [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5886.38s)]
*  I feel for everyone who like calls it how he sees it. I think [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5888.38s)]
*  He's the closest to being authentic [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5893.74s)]
*  No, I think john is authentic. Yeah john is purely authentic what i'm saying is he also knows that this thing on trump [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5896.959999999999s)]
*  Is bullshit and the only reason he's doing it is because trump is running for president [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5903.5199999999995s)]
*  He could have done this 20 times over with every developer in new york city. He didn't [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5908.879999999999s)]
*  He's doing it because it is an example of why this person that maybe he believes is unfit to be president [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5914.48s)]
*  Shouldn't be [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5922.08s)]
*  That that's what i'm saying and also he's running for [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5923.44s)]
*  Public office and he should be scrutinized just like anybody else's 100 and john's show is to talk about politics [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5927.12s)]
*  So he's not going to just pick on any other developer 100 100 [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5932.799999999999s)]
*  I i'm not critical of the choice [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5937.599999999999s)]
*  I am critical of the choice about this specific thing when maybe there are other things that he could focus on [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=5940.879999999999s)]

*  That has [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=6878.66s)]
*  The worst branding i've ever seen the worst name i've ever seen there's a couple like casting issues [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=6880.900000000001s)]
*  But the show itself is really compelling and interesting [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=6886.66s)]
*  It's based on this like novel like one of the highest selling novels ever and it's done by the guys who did game of thrones [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=6889.700000000001s)]
*  And james cameron tried to buy the rights of the novel multiple times [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=6896.34s)]
*  They just wouldn't give it to them. They finally agreed to give it to this guy [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=6899.38s)]
*  It's like one of the most best-selling books of all time really cool story [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=6902.02s)]
*  Uh and um, wait, but the guys who even did game of thrones that was the ones who did seasons seven and eight [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=6906.26s)]
*  No, that did all the whole time often. Those guys did the whole thing and then seven and eight is where it kind of fell off [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=6912.02s)]
*  But they did the whole when it was great. They still did it. Oh god. Yes. Yeah [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=6918.18s)]
*  Yeah, and they really did it with like, uh, no writers room [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=6921.3s)]
*  It was them for all those great seasons that you love. Yeah, so they are they had a [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=6925.46s)]
*  I mean they had a good source material [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=6928.98s)]
*  So to be fair to them they have source material with an ending this time and they don't have to make their own shitty god-awful ending [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=6934.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, okay. Yeah. Oh, I mean you're nice. You're fucking great. Anyway new show on netflix. I think very uh interesting [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=6939.78s)]
*  Uh, how do I tell you what it's about without like giving away too much? Uh [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=6947.54s)]
*  Um [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=6954.34s)]
*  You know, just watch it. Yeah. Yeah, maybe just check it out [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=6955.54s)]
*  But it's cool [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=6957.62s)]
*  But if you're looking at the branding of it or if you're looking at like trailers and that kind of shit from it [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=6958.1s)]
*  It kind of sucks and I would see why you wouldn't want to do it [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=6962.9s)]
*  but then when you get into the story the story is that kind of really interesting dense and uh, [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=6965.78s)]
*  And cool just fire one thing is I don't think you can I think they're a show [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=6970.5s)]
*  Yeah, not they probably had a lot of approval rights. You're not going to change the name of the book. That's what people know [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=6974.26s)]
*  that's what it is and then on the [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=6979.38s)]
*  The first teaser I agree you don't know what it's about just give it a shot [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=6982.5s)]
*  Is it going to be the the show that saves us as a nation that gives us everything to watch each and a week? [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=6986.82s)]
*  No, not at all. Just another fun thing for us to watch fun show. I started watching the gentleman [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=6991.22s)]

*  It was great [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7001.38s)]
*  This is kind of like taking a part of the movie and making building a series off of that part [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7002.18s)]
*  But I think it's going to be good. Um, like almost through the first episode and it's just fun just great [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7006.66s)]

*  The thing about someone said about like uh greenpoint is like, um [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7187.78s)]

*  There was always there but like so they just don't have certain things that you just uh, [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7201.86s)]

*  It was the headquarters for the globalists [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7237.38s)]
*  I talked to a globalist on the phone trying to like figure out a deal for the apartment and what the globalist said [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7240.98s)]
*  It's the globalist that runs my current apartment [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7245.14s)]
*  And I was like is there any way you can keep me in the area because my wife is a midwife for the globalist community [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7246.74s)]

*  In yeah, do you have any advice apartment hunting? What should I do? Man, should I buy a place and renovate it? What do you think? [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7303.219999999999s)]
*  Don't trust me on most financial things [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7318.179999999999s)]
*  Oh my god, who would have thought you would have thought you know, you get a nice, you know [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7321.94s)]
*  Nice piece of a real estate because you got such a globalist name you would think [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7325.219999999999s)]
*  Once they find out you're not globalist then [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7330.179999999999s)]
*  Fucking they feel they feel bad. Oh my god [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7332.98s)]
*  You got the place without the help of a globalist to seal the deal you use a globy but not to find it, right? [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7335.38s)]
*  I just want to make sure I want to just I located the deal myself. Okay, so song's globalist [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7342.259999999999s)]
*  I found the deal. Yeah, I'm sure it was listed by a globalist [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7347.78s)]
*  But I found it [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7351.14s)]
*  um [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7353.22s)]
*  And now we have the meatballs working on it [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7354.580000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but the meatballs are very you need the enchiladas really the chimichangas working on it [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7357.54s)]
*  The meatballs hire the chimichangas [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7363.46s)]
*  So the meatballs have hired the chimichangas [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7366.02s)]
*  and [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7368.42s)]
*  And the chimichangas I think are fantastic [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7369.46s)]
*  But the meatballs I don't know if they're communicating to the chimichangas what needs to get done, right? So there's really no head meatball [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7372.740000000001s)]
*  That's the problem. Yeah, so every time you go in it's like something hasn't been ordered or something like, you know [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7379.3s)]
*  I guarantee if it was some fresh fucking tomatoes, they'd get ordered [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7384.18s)]
*  But when you need the meatballs to actually order the millwork that shit doesn't get done [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7387.06s)]
*  So I think that we have what is commonly referred to in the business as a meatball problem [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7392.18s)]
*  Yes, because the globy did help you with this space put up the walls do the things no, no, let's be very [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7396.5s)]
*  Oh, let's be very clear about this. No, but the meatball found the globy [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7403.780000000001s)]
*  Anagasaki helped us with this place [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7407.62s)]
*  Anagasaki designed this place a nuke design this place [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7410.18s)]
*  Right, a nuke design this place it rhymes. It does well design technically built [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7415.3s)]
*  God [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7421.06s)]
*  So but then there was we did have a globalist [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-ywOVbOiQ&t=7428.9s)]
